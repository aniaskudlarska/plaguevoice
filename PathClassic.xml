<string id="500172"><![CDATA[I'm Daniil Dankovsky.]]></string>
<string id="500174"><![CDATA[You are a good person to drink with and talk to. You will make no mistake by calling me Peter. You can call me Andrey too, just for the sake of diversity, and it won't be wrong either.]]></string>
<string id="500175"><![CDATA[This means that the man standing before me is able to see what others cannot. My name is Peter and I have built quite a few things upon this stone already. Are you a geometrician?]]></string>

<string id="500287"><![CDATA[So, I finally get to see you... Yes, you really do look like a messenger of sorrowful times. In any case, welcome to The Rod. Our meeting is quite significant in a way. Facing the changes with open eyes and taking their first blow is my duty.]]></string>
<string id="500288"><![CDATA[Sometimes I have to. Are you an astrologist?]]></string>
<string id="500289"><![CDATA[The movement of the planets has an obvious effect on our life. However, I do not think it's humanly possible to gain any profit from that.]]></string>
<string id="500290"><![CDATA[Who do I have the pleasure of speaking to, sir?]]></string>
<string id="500291"><![CDATA[I am a ruler. Astrology can be very curious, but I cannot allow it to influence my decisions. I have to act according to factual circumstances. Would you agree?]]></string>
<string id="500292"><![CDATA[Definitely.]]></string>

<string id="500295"><![CDATA[…The only proper way for a duel to end is with the death of one of the fighters. That's what battles are supposed to be... Any conflict that has two sides inevitably turns into a battle of good and evil…]]></string>
<string id="500296"><![CDATA[Why are you telling me this?]]></string>
<string id="500297"><![CDATA[A brutal philosophy.]]></string>
<string id="500298"><![CDATA[I never liked black-and-white mentality.]]></string>
<string id="500299"><![CDATA[I'm not speaking… metaphorically or metaphysically. I'm talking about a very particular battle... You are one of the combatants, Bachelor Dankovsky. Do you favour good or evil?]]></string>
<string id="500300"><![CDATA[I favour winning.]]></string>
<string id="500301"><![CDATA[That's too vague a question.]]></string>
<string id="500302"><![CDATA[Spoken like a true warrior. I truly wish you victory, Bachelor… Even though I doubt there can be a victory at all in this battle.]]></string>
<string id="500303"><![CDATA[You are very kind.]]></string>
<string id="500304"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="500305"><![CDATA[I cannot be more coherent... Details distort the core essence… they devalue the words.]]></string>
<string id="500306"><![CDATA[What you're saying is it will be I who is to adjust the details along the way, right?]]></string>
<string id="500307"><![CDATA[But without details you sound delirious.]]></string>
<string id="500324"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="500325"><![CDATA[...I seem to have lost any capacity for observation. My mind is out of tune; things no longer add up. Before, I had no trouble forming a trustworthy tessellation out of the most imperceptible contingencies. Now, I simply cannot get my head around it. Could it be that I am dying?]]></string>
<string id="500326"><![CDATA[The steppe air is way too thick. I think that's what causes it.]]></string>
<string id="500327"><![CDATA[It happens when people are tired. You probably haven't slept for a while, have you?]]></string>
<string id="500328"><![CDATA[Yes, it definitely means you are about to die.]]></string>
<string id="500329"><![CDATA[Oh no... Herba Tvirinae is in blossom, I grant you, but then it blooms every year. Every year the Steppe is filled with its stupefying vapours. The issue I am having, however, has nothing to do with fatigue or perplexity. It is just that I've lost my ability to make distinctive events coincide.]]></string>
<string id="500330"><![CDATA[What herb is that?]]></string>
<string id="500331"><![CDATA[No matter what preternatural traits the the locals ascribe to it, twyre is all heady aroma, a bunch of superstitions and remarkably little else. It has psychoactive properties, after a fashion, but then so does simple wormwood. Visions caused by ingestion of beladonna or jimsonweed are much more fascinating than what twyre has to offer.]]></string>
<string id="500333"><![CDATA[It's a pity I'm not a botanist.]]></string>
<string id="500334"><![CDATA[Everyone has that ability.]]></string>
<string id="500335"><![CDATA[You don't seem to understand what I'm saying. Let me elucidate: a single word someone utters may precipitate the birth of their own murderer. This line of philosophising is barely an intellectual novelty, and it is particularly relevant in our neck of the woods. I sometimes feel like I could touch the notions of cause and effect with the tips of my fingers... But now I am being tedious, I reckon.]]></string>
<string id="500336"><![CDATA[Not at all.]]></string>
<string id="500337"><![CDATA[I'm sorry to say, but yes, you are a bit tedious.]]></string>
<string id="500338"><![CDATA[Is this so? If I die, the universe would not notice my passing. But what if there are people who are the walking embodiment of the law by which events are connected to each other? What would happen to the universe if any one of these people were to die?]]></string>
<string id="500339"><![CDATA[Do you think you are such a person?]]></string>
<string id="500341"><![CDATA[When I was a child I took enormous pleasure in thinking I was one. Later in my life, as a student, I rather saw it as an honour of which I was not necessarily deserving. Today, however, I treat it as a somewhat scornful affliction. ]]></string>
<string id="500343"><![CDATA[That's unprovable.]]></string>
<string id="500344"><![CDATA[I prefer not to think of things like that.]]></string>

<string id="500359"><![CDATA[Not in the slightest. I'm in a hurry.]]></string>
<string id="500360"><![CDATA[Look around. Some houses are always open for you. Others open for everyone only under special circumstances... if a person dies, or when there's a wedding or something. Others still are only open to those who can find a creephole in.]]></string>

<string id="500365"><![CDATA[I'm a bit too big for creepholes.]]></string>
<string id="500366"><![CDATA[Well, I collect places like that. I made a map a year ago; now there are so many marks on it that there's no room for houses. I hid in a house for about two hours once—the owners were there, but they didn't notice me.]]></string>
<string id="500367"><![CDATA[Interesting.]]></string>

<string id="500369"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="500370"><![CDATA[It's hard... Not only do they need to be fed—but talked to as well. I need to find the words of comfort for them. Only then will they repay us with tenderness and joy. But now they are all anxious, every single one of them is mumbling something. That's why I look so tired.]]></string>
<string id="500371"><![CDATA[Who are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="500372"><![CDATA[Where is the caretaker of the cemetery?]]></string>
<string id="500373"><![CDATA[Of the dead themselves. Do not assume that people die forever—not everyone does. Some people live underground and only die out for the lack of care. You have to always knock from this side so that they don't fade away.]]></string>

<string id="500375"><![CDATA[Let me examine your pupils... Okay, now your pulse... Do you take drugs?]]></string>
<string id="500376"><![CDATA[No. It's twyre the herb. We sleep in the very heart of the Steppe, you know. I'm all green because of it... It's high time for it at the moment. Can you hear how the air is tolling? That's twyre.]]></string>
<string id="500377"><![CDATA[I am the caretaker. Since my father died.]]></string>

<string id="500388"><![CDATA[Ain't it obvious? The brotherhood of thieves, that's where you are! You've got two options now, you do: dine in hell—with us; or run like hell—from us.]]></string>
<string id="500389"><![CDATA[We ain't a quick buck to be loved by every schmuck. Care not for our mugs, but rather for your soul, kind sir. Too much self-assurance can be fatal. Ain't you afraid?]]></string>

<string id="500398"><![CDATA[I'll keep that in mind.]]></string>
<string id="500400"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="500401"><![CDATA[Ah, Bachelor Dankovsky, of course... Who else could be so dapper... I've heard quite a lot about you... Have you taken a look around? Be sure to check the state of the industry around here... We have our own ways.]]></string>
<string id="500402"><![CDATA[How curious! And what is the current state of your industry?]]></string>
<string id="500403"><![CDATA[Do you think I've come to inspect this town?]]></string>
<string id="500404"><![CDATA[I can't say I'm interested.]]></string>
<string id="500405"><![CDATA[Come now... It's a complicated establishment with a thousand years of history. A special approach is required to control such a colossus. See where I'm getting at, emissary?]]></string>
<string id="500406"><![CDATA[Come now… That's precisely what I'm saying... The sanitary inspection testified last year that the Bull Project is in order. Nothing to cavil at. Everything's fine.]]></string>
<string id="500407"><![CDATA[It would be pointless to object.]]></string>
<string id="500408"><![CDATA[But no! Such businesses always leave room for improvement.]]></string>
<string id="500409"><![CDATA[I can see we're not really seeing eye to eye. The Project is special... Very special! That means... common standards do not apply here. That would be very naïve.]]></string>
<string id="500410"><![CDATA[You are probably right.]]></string>
<string id="500411"><![CDATA[We'll come back to that.]]></string>
<string id="500412"><![CDATA[You have probably mistaken me for someone else. I have nothing to do with your enterprise.]]></string>
<string id="500413"><![CDATA[Good for you.]]></string>
<string id="500414"><![CDATA[Nothing to talk about then.]]></string>
<string id="500415"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="500416"><![CDATA[You've found me here? Oh well, I'm not surprised. I suppose you're not too surprised by the fact that everyone knows about you either. The rumour of your arrival spread like fire. Why have you come?]]></string>
<string id="500417"><![CDATA[What's the solution to the puzzle?]]></string>
<string id="500418"><![CDATA[Such things happen all the time.]]></string>
<string id="500419"><![CDATA[...When the worried adults came to the place where the children had been playing, they found nothing unusual there, only sticks and stones. What do you make of it?]]></string>
<string id="500420"><![CDATA[Your children play peculiar games.]]></string>
<string id="500422"><![CDATA[Ah, nothing special. They probably dug out a dead cat.]]></string>
<string id="500423"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="500424"><![CDATA[The Theatre welcomes the distinguished audience at any time. There's a performance of the Masks every evening, and the blood gets rinsed off every night. The rest of the time slots are filled with a puppet-show. But that's not all we have! Magic tricks, fortune-telling, dream-reading! Whoever has eyes, let them see.]]></string>
<string id="500425"><![CDATA[Is this a theatre? It's rather small...]]></string>
<string id="500426"><![CDATA[True. This is a chamber theatre. And since I have the pleasure of being the booking agent, director, and the impresario around here, I can also tell you that our shows are not for everyone's eyes.]]></string>
<string id="500427"><![CDATA[When is the next performance?]]></string>
<string id="500429"><![CDATA[But it's empty at the moment.]]></string>
<string id="500430"><![CDATA[That is a deceiving impression. The theatre is small, but it holds quite a few secrets. Like the mime who is currently picking the threads from your clothes; or the Mask who is sewing your fate for the next few days from those threads.]]></string>

<string id="500432"><![CDATA[I think I should go.]]></string>

<string id="500435"><![CDATA[You are too talkative, sir.]]></string>
<string id="500436"><![CDATA[That's for you to decide. You are a part of the lineup. The playscript is not yet complete, you see. Everything depends on your actions. You won't have to wait long.]]></string>

<string id="500438"><![CDATA[Sounds quite intriguing, but unfortunately, I have other matters to attend to.]]></string>

<string id="500447"><![CDATA[The things you'll see here are not subject to comprehension. They'll burst into your everyday routine like the horrors of your childhood that have come to life; they'll thrash your logical thinking and disrupt every single part of you... the sharp mind of an analyst won't be able to wrap around them. You can't even imagine.]]></string>
<string id="500449"><![CDATA[There is nothing in this world that could make me lose my mind.]]></string>
<string id="500450"><![CDATA[Everyone who sits at this table. See? They are all trying to be mysterious, but in reality every action we take is a mere consequence of a deep wound. Our words are like the drops of blood seeping from it. Sorrow is what opens people up fully.]]></string>

<string id="501151"><![CDATA[My dear Bachelor Dankovsky!

It was most disconcerting to learn that the Powers That Be have the intention of shutting down the laboratory that owes its fame largely to your own research in the field of thanatology.

Is it true that your detractors have branded your studies "scientifically stillborn"? Rejoice, Bachelor, for there is an observable case that would quell the obscurants that reject the research of death, aging, and necrosis as a subject that lacks academic viability. This case, were you to document it, would go a long way towards restoring your reputation as a scholar.

The subject in question is Simon Kain, who has ruled the town where I live for as long as I can remember. This man's longevity transcends the boundaries of what is plausible. It is phenomenal, no less, and I struggle to give an explanation of it with what scientific means I have at my disposal. Make no delay. There is a sensational discovery to be made here, a breakthrough that will not only save your laboratory, but also revivify your studies and greatly increase your scientific renown.

Your humble servant and faithful colleague,
Isidor Burakh

P.S. I spoke to Simon on your behalf and he has kindly agreed to facilitate your effort. Daring ideas and far-fetched projects are traditionally very well respected in our neck of the woods.]]></string>

There must have been a mistake of the most regrettable kind. I was duly informed that you arrived in town last night. Unfortunately, my servants must have missed you at the station and were unable to guide you towards Bridge Square. I urge you to see me in the Crucible, my mansion, at your earliest convenience.

Respectfully eager to meet you,
Simon Kain]]></string>

<string id="501155"><![CDATA[You must make haste!

The sun will set in four hours. Unless you are able to recognize the shabnak's guise, she will kill you before nightfall. Tarry not, I beg you! I am the only one who can tell you what the monster looks like.

Meet me in the Rod, outside the Tanners district.

Katerina]]></string>
<string id="501156"><![CDATA[Katerina's Warning]]></string>
<string id="501157"><![CDATA[Daniil, I am writing this in a hurry, so do forgive the uncustomary brevity!

The Powers That Be are closing in on us. They persecuted us before, as you know, but now they are set to utterly exterminate us. We may yet be able to persevere, but you, my friend, are in grave danger!

It is almost as if your destination was chosen to be the place of your burial. They say there is some kind of disease in the town, of a most lethal variety; perhaps Plague itself.

I have little doubt that the Powers That Be have set up your whole journey. Telman, that vermin, wants to get rid of you more than he wants to cease the outbreak. I wouldn't be surprised if it transpires that there are no medical personnel whatsoever in the town! They will use it as pretext to delegate the whole mess of it to you. If this is the case, I urge you to keep out of trouble. Stay safe, Daniil; wait for the sanitary teams. They will arrive sooner or later.

Take care, my friend! If they tell you to engage the Plague by yourself, refuse it, even if your principles enjoin you to do otherwise. Our research is what matters the most and we will not be able to go on with it if you are dead...

Yours, A]]></string>

<string id="501159"><![CDATA[Bachelor,

The body has been isolated, as far as I know. Rubin conducts the examination of it.

Nevertheless, keeping in mind your discovery, I would advise you to see me in the Rod first thing tomorrow morning. There is a matter of crucial importance that we need to discuss.

Alexander Saburov]]></string>
<string id="501160"><![CDATA[The Body is Isolated]]></string>
<string id="501174"><![CDATA[Bachelor,

As I have already informed you, I have a request to make. It is a matter of utmost importance.

I will elaborate on the situation in detail as soon as you come to see me in the Rod. In the event you consider our requests to be outside your area of responsibility, I will have to contact someone else with this. However, there is little doubt in my mind that the incompetence of the volunteers I would recruit will result in them losing their lives.

<string id="501412"><![CDATA[Bachelor Dankovsky,

By what seems to be a very lucky coincidence, you have found yourself in a town that is wrought by some very worrying occurences. Reportedly, there is an outbreak of dangerous disease in the vicinity. There is also an opinion that the outbreak is a falsification staged deliberately for the purpose of concealing a murder.

In consideration of your outstanding analytical capability, we delegate the investigation to you. If there is an epidemic, it must be halted by any means necessary.

You should collect as much information as you can, we suppose, and then make a decision in line with your own professional ethics and moral beliefs. In order to implement your strategy, an Inquisitor endowed with unrestricted authority will shortly arrive to join you. In the event that you are unable to curb the outbreak before their arrival, all power over the situation will be reassigned to them.

P.S.
It has come to our attention that you have recently requested permission to continue with your own research. The decision of whether or not such permission will be granted depends on the results of this assignment. Your success, therefore, has a bearing on your scientific reputation and your further academic career.

Professor Telman]]></string>

<string id="502850"><![CDATA[We need to plan the battle in advance. "The battle" being the task that lies ahead of us. I will not give up without a fight, even if everyone else has come to terms with their own mortality. We need to join our forces, Bachelor, and combine our diverse skills.

Our enemy is invisible, ubiquitous, dissolved into the very things that we will need to purify. The enemy seems invulnerable, but it is not imperceptible, and whatever terror it instills in us is explained simply by our lack of knowledge. If we are to destroy the enemy, we need to study it first. For this, we need to capture it. This is our first and foremost priority.

Please forgive my reiteration of self-evident things like these. My only reason for spelling it all out is to better understand it myself.

Our goals are not quite the same. I strive to save as many lives as possible, whereas your purpose is to put an end to the outbreak. I've been told of your abiding desire to uncover the truth. I would gladly help you with that, if you will help me achieve my goal. Together, we can eradicate the disease, and save everything that might still be saved.

<string id="503073"><![CDATA["In Pursuit of a Killer"]]></string>
<string id="503074"><![CDATA[All these years I have been accused of different things. Some saw me as a rambling bedlamite, some as a heartless thrill-seeker, a ruthless careerist who would stop at nothing and stoop to anything. For them, whatever research I would take on was but a piece of opportunistic buffoonery, that succeeds only in travestying the very purpose of scientific knowledge.

Let them gossip all they like. None of them will have the temerity to say I ever went against my own principles! Let them keep a list of my most outrageous blasphemies; all I do serves one single master, and the name of this master is Truth.

They have trapped me now, they think. I was brought to a battle of a kind that only a victor may survive. I was posed against a riddle that I will not leave unsolved. I'd rather die than give in.

My reason for being here is to put an end to the outbreak. To do so I must learn everything there is to know about this unfamiliar disease; to reach a conclusion on how it may be counteracted. Then I should present my findings to the Inquisitor who will mobilise their authority to prevent the disaster.

This is what is expected of me. And, rest assured, this is what they're going to get.]]></string>
<string id="503075"><![CDATA[It is no longer evident what the Powers That Be are waiting for. What is abundantly clear, however, is that they are equally as mendacious as they are unmerciful. Do they intend to preserve this chimera of a town? Of course they do. Are they determined to put an end to the outbreak? The devil himself wouldn't know the answer to that. Would they be pleased by the news of Bachelor Dankovsky's death? Beyond question, they would.

Having said that, now is not the time to give up. It is fortunate that they didn't dispatch the barbarous Karminsky here, and a different Inquisitor arrived instead. It is even better that this new Inquisitor is alike me in some respects. Essentially, we are locked inside the same cage.

Aglaya Lilich told me she was going to help. Her plan will allow me to keep my word; to carry out my orders to the letter and in so doing to destroy the very core of what the Powers That Be have planned. They will plunge into their own pitfall and reap the consequences of their deception.

What we must do, then, is to find out which part of the town the source of the infection is nested in and reduce the whole area to rubble. By these means, the expansion of the disease will come to a halt.]]></string>
<string id="503076"><![CDATA[You may have thought, at some point, that she was your most reliable ally. Why wouldn't she be? Her troubles, you thought, were so much like your own. Just like you, she fell victim to this perpetual confrontation between those who have their honour intact and those who have none at all.

Proud like you; astute like you and no less devoted to the relentless pursuit of Truth. These were the feeble assurances you used to comfort yourself with, until the very moment you could no longer deny her betrayal. The Truth that she has placed so helpfully for you to stumble upon has proven to be nothing but lies; deception fed by decades of hatred and an abiding desire for vengeance. The solution was an intricately composed hoax.

Scheming wench! Knowing all too well that she would not be able to bribe you, or to trick the Commander, she has contrived to control him by your words instead of her own. She aimed his guns with your hands while she herself remained hidden. This is what Inquisitors do. You are not the first to have been played in this manner.

How long are you going to let her pull your strings? The Truth will not reveal itself to a puppet; the flame of enlightenment will not burn without the oxygen of free will! What are you going to do?

Are you free enough to stand tall; to break the shackles of someone else's deception; to keep your word and to make the right choice? Should life be sustained in this corpse of a town—or should it be put out of its misery?

What will your verdict be, Bachelor?]]></string>

<string id="503503"><![CDATA[I'm not trying to do anything! I can see it in your eyes—you're strong, but dreadfully exhausted... Deceived by the people that you're used to relying upon... I can see the excruciating torment that you have to go through—while all you want is to remain honest and uncover the truth... that's why your eyes are so full of anger and spite...]]></string>
<string id="503504"><![CDATA[Enough. Roll up your sleeve and extend your hand. ]]></string>
<string id="503505"><![CDATA[I want to ease your burden. You're horribly exhausted. And yet you somehow managed to survive, even though you've been infected many times… which means you were dying many times, doesn't it? Oh, how I want to be of help to you… ]]></string>
<string id="503506"><![CDATA[Yes, you have a shrewd eye for human condition... But your spell is not going to work on me. ]]></string>
<string id="503507"><![CDATA[Were you in the Cathedral last night? Tell me.]]></string>
<string id="503508"><![CDATA[Clara, you are being accused of the premediated murder of several hundreds of people; the victims are still being counted. The method of murder: deliberately infecting them via personal contact. Were you the cloaked woman that was seen in the Cathedral last night?]]></string>
<string id="503509"><![CDATA["On it's own"? Next you'll be telling me rats and mice are born from trash—on their own? ]]></string>
<string id="503510"><![CDATA[No, of course that's not how it… But what makes you think that I am guilty? Other people come and go there all the time.]]></string>
<string id="503511"><![CDATA[Only after a thorough checkup. ]]></string>
<string id="503512"><![CDATA[But they could have brought something in secretly! A child could have brought a toy, someone could have concealed a bottle of water or a slice of meat! It's only natural, see, people knew it would be hard to wait in the Cathedral for several days—there's almost no food delivered! Someone just couldn't help it.]]></string>
<string id="503513"><![CDATA[Sounds convincing. But don't try to charm me. ]]></string>
<string id="503514"><![CDATA[Yes, this is a possibility.]]></string>
<string id="503515"><![CDATA[But why did the mass agony began precisely when you came by?]]></string>
<string id="503516"><![CDATA[Although… I already have. Go in peace. ]]></string>
<string id="503517"><![CDATA[It doesn't matter, it's not like you believe me anyway. What if my blood turns out to be wrong in some way, what will you do to me then?]]></string>
<string id="503518"><![CDATA[Hand first, questions later.]]></string>
<string id="503520"><![CDATA[I'll hand you over to Olgimsky. He'll be in charge of the execution from then on.]]></string>
<string id="503521"><![CDATA[Oh... But what about Katerina? And Alexander... He said he would be like a father to me... They'll stand up for me! This must a mistake, I think they haven't been told. No one can execute me without their consent…]]></string>
<string id="503522"><![CDATA[The Saburovs have washed their hands of you.]]></string>

<string id="503525"><![CDATA[Your hand. ]]></string>
<string id="503526"><![CDATA[I don't care. And stand still.]]></string>
<string id="503527"><![CDATA[Clara. Hey, look at me here. Are you yourself aware of what you're being accused of?]]></string>
<string id="503528"><![CDATA[So this is true... Someone truly believes that I have brought this into the world? I was beginning to suspect…]]></string>
<string id="503529"><![CDATA[I don't believe in mysticism. I don't believe you to be a character of fearful pagan tales. But then—tell me about your past! Where did you come from? How did you make it through the Steppe? Who is your father? Your mother? Tell me—and I won't have to hand you over to the Inquisitor.]]></string>
<string id="503530"><![CDATA[You're right... The evidence is incontrovertible... Every single fact about myself that I'm positive of speaks against me. I know that I can only exist in a dying world. I know that I have no place in a world without a plague. I know all that for sure. Does that mean that I am the plague?]]></string>
<string id="503531"><![CDATA[We'll find out in a moment.]]></string>
<string id="503532"><![CDATA[That you're the plague... No. No, it doesn't mean that. Go, Clara. Go—and avoid the Inquisitor. Whoever arrives, their punishment will be swift.]]></string>
<string id="503533"><![CDATA[Anything else? ]]></string>
<string id="503534"><![CDATA[We have been informed that one of them visited the Termitary two days prior to your arrival. Do examine them, Dankovsky. Look deeply into their blood! You're the only one who can tell a human being from a... creature. Point at the offender, and the rest will live. ]]></string>
<string id="503535"><![CDATA[First and foremost we need to find Burakh. ]]></string>
<string id="503536"><![CDATA[Burakh's disappeared. There's not a single word from him. And there's no time to lose. The inquisitor will be here any day now, and heads will roll. ]]></string>
<string id="503537"><![CDATA[...yours and Saburov's appear to be the first on the to-roll list.]]></string>
<string id="503538"><![CDATA[But what does it have to do with me?]]></string>
<string id="503539"><![CDATA[Did Burakh meet any of those ladies the previous evening?]]></string>
<string id="503540"><![CDATA[We don't know. Burakh has gone completely silent. He must be rotting in some pit now anyway, poisoned with his own achievement. ]]></string>
<string id="503541"><![CDATA[Your proof then? Why do you think it were them?]]></string>
<string id="503561"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="503562"><![CDATA[What is a shabnak? It's an evil spirit wearing woman's flesh over its bones. Shabnak can be detected by several distinct signs: its arms are too long, all of its toes are of the same length, and you can see teeth peeping out from under its skin.]]></string>
<string id="503563"><![CDATA[Whoa…]]></string>
<string id="503564"><![CDATA[Thanks for the lesson. ]]></string>
<string id="503565"><![CDATA[What makes you think I want to know this?]]></string>
<string id="503566"><![CDATA[Well... You seemed to be trying to catch him. ]]></string>
<string id="503568"><![CDATA[Give me your hand, Aspity. I've got a hunch he's standing right in front of me. ]]></string>
<string id="503569"><![CDATA[Whoa indeed… I'm always happy to help. Want me to help you catch the monster? You're failing at this anyway… Almost a week has passed, but people keep dying and dying and dying and dying…]]></string>
<string id="503570"><![CDATA[Enough. I can see people die without your help. Now give me your hand.]]></string>
<string id="503571"><![CDATA[Sure, go ahead. Where to start? Perhaps the examination of the suspects would help?]]></string>
<string id="503572"><![CDATA[Of course it will! Here's how it goes: you gather all the ladies that you find disconcerting in the Cathedral—it won't be hard seeing how it's empty now. You light up a huge fire by the entrance. Then you make them strip naked and begin the very thorough examination... looking for the sharp protrusions from beneath the skin. You don't find any, of course. Then...]]></string>
<string id="503573"><![CDATA[I have an alternative solution. How about we take a look at your blood?]]></string>
<string id="503574"><![CDATA[Blood is unnecessary. Look for the teeth. So do you want to hear the rest or not? Anyway, sooner or later one of them will break, unable to endure it any longer, and make a dash for it in tears. Straight into the fire, of course. And that's when her true nature will become apparent! She'll turn all black, she'll howl and wail, her fingers will become crooked... It'll be pretty obvious then that she's no human!]]></string>
<string id="503575"><![CDATA[Stop laughing at me!]]></string>
<string id="503576"><![CDATA[Do you think this is funny?]]></string>
<string id="503577"><![CDATA[You are a laughing stock anyway, doctor. Isn't this exactly what you're doing? You should be stripping them naked—even that would allow you catch a more faithful glimpse of reality than those lenses of yours. Tried and true! Or… Oh, it just dawned on me! Perhaps this is it? Perhaps you're so angry because you don't get enough female attention?]]></string>
<string id="503579"><![CDATA[Sure. Now stand still. And don't worry, the needles are new.]]></string>
<string id="503581"><![CDATA[Enough. I'm only doing all this to protect you. Now let me take a look at your blood.]]></string>
<string id="503582"><![CDATA[As time passes, I still can't get used to your scorn. If the carrier is so easy to distinguish, why are they still looking for a human?]]></string>
<string id="503583"><![CDATA[Because it's a gang of morons who's doing the looking, oh wise Bachelor Daniil, and you're the gang leader.]]></string>

<string id="503639"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="503640"><![CDATA[So, what is the news? Any further discoveries?]]></string>
<string id="503641"><![CDATA[Yesterday, I finally saw the murderer. A very unpleasant sight. ]]></string>
<string id="503642"><![CDATA[It is done. Victory is within my grasp. The disease may be fought! ]]></string>
<string id="503643"><![CDATA[Oh, is that so? Would you tell me more?]]></string>
<string id="503644"><![CDATA[It could have been worse. What we're dealing with is a bacterium of a very distinctive type—although I have to admit I've never seen anything like it. It propagates extremely quickly; it's truly unbelievable. However, I have a theory already... ]]></string>
<string id="503645"><![CDATA[A disgusting worm with a horned head and a cluster of long, clawed feelers. There is a characteristic heaviness at the bottom of its body. When dormant, it resembles a woman in a wedding gown... I'm kidding, I'm kidding. It looks nothing like that.]]></string>
<string id="503646"><![CDATA[What kind of theory?]]></string>
<string id="503647"><![CDATA[A bacterium of this kind could only emerge in a very specific environment... So I suspect that all cases we're dealing with have to have a common source. I so much hope it's true! If this source of infection is eradicated, the outbreak will cease.]]></string>
<string id="503648"><![CDATA[Coincidences, coincidences every which way... Am I being delirious? Why else would no one else recognise what is so obvious to me?]]></string>
<string id="503649"><![CDATA[What are you talking about? ]]></string>
<string id="503650"><![CDATA[Indeed. The story of my life, believe it or not. Trying desperately to draw their attention to what seems to be painfully obvious, offering any conceivable proof that these "coincidences" must be studied! To no avail.]]></string>
<string id="503651"><![CDATA[Something of my own, I guess. Hidden causes and surprising effects.]]></string>
<string id="503652"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="503653"><![CDATA[The bacteria that have already escaped into the open will expire very soon—they can't survive without living blood. And, whenever they find blood, they immediately deplete it—to consequently perish like fish out of water.]]></string>
<string id="503654"><![CDATA[So, what do you have in mind? ]]></string>
<string id="503655"><![CDATA[Everything happens for a reason. There is always just one single detail, one source from which fateful consequences emerge. Remove the source... and the balance will be reestablished. Who knows; a single butterfly, crushed, miles away, may be what it takes for the town to survive. There must always be a cause to everything, you see...]]></string>
<string id="503656"><![CDATA[This is exactly what I was thinking on my way here. You wouldn't believe it, but some of my theories are quite similar to yours... ]]></string>
<string id="503657"><![CDATA[An infection like this can only be spread by a living being, in whose blood the bacteria procreate at an insane rate. I don't believe that the host realizes that at all. Make note of how the disease behaves. It burns bright... and then it burns out very quickly.]]></string>
<string id="503658"><![CDATA[Well, this leads us to a very simple conclusion: find the guilty party and burn them. Then, the age of blissful serenity will come down upon us.]]></string>
<string id="503659"><![CDATA[If only it was so simple... ]]></string>
<string id="503660"><![CDATA[It's nothing more than a theory. If it turns out to be true, we can consider the outbreak curbed. Hopefully.]]></string>
<string id="503661"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="503662"><![CDATA[Is there anything I can do to be of help?]]></string>
<string id="503663"><![CDATA[Oh no, it's not like that. I only came by to check on you.]]></string>
<string id="503664"><![CDATA[I'd be extremely thankful to you if you could feed me and provide me with medicine.]]></string>
<string id="503665"><![CDATA[Go ahead and take anything you might need.]]></string>
<string id="503666"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="503667"><![CDATA[I've been thinking… do you think this evil can be punished at all? If it has neither a source nor a carrier, how can it be stopped? It's dissolved in the things that can neither be cut nor burnt. This challenge… is beyond human capabilities, isn't it? …Tell me, does the Inquisitor arrive today?]]></string>
<string id="503668"><![CDATA[Today or tomorrow. ]]></string>
<string id="503669"><![CDATA[Why do you ask?]]></string>
<string id="503670"><![CDATA[The purpose of the Inquisition if just that: they exist to do the humanly impossible. That's the only way to justify their horrible license… Rumour has it, we've been sent someone particularly sinister. Is that true?]]></string>
<string id="503671"><![CDATA[I think it's Karminsky. A rather peculiar man. He is a morphine addict. He'll take morphine, doze off for a day, and then present a solution to any problem. He's living with one foot in the grave and another on the scaffold, but he has yet to make a single mistake.]]></string>
<string id="503672"><![CDATA[There is always a source. And today I will figure it out, whatever the cost!]]></string>
<string id="503673"><![CDATA[Perhaps it'll be Orff, that owl of a man. He specializes in calamities of dramatic scale. Famine, riot, epidemic, drought... "Orff" is an alias, and no one knows his real name. ]]></string>
<string id="503674"><![CDATA[And you're obliged to suggest a complete and workable solution to the Inquisitor, aren't you?]]></string>
<string id="503675"><![CDATA[Well, not necessarily. But if I do, no one would dare lay a finger on my Thanatica—the Powers That Be gave me their word. And it's entirely possible that my victory award would be a discovery that'll prolong human life from 60-70 years to a hundred.]]></string>
<string id="503676"><![CDATA[Not necessarily. I just have to pass over the data I've managed to collect to him, that's all.]]></string>
<string id="503677"><![CDATA[Well, you're almost done, aren't you? You've figured out how to crush it, haven't you? You've estimated and calculated the requirements… haven't you?]]></string>
<string id="503678"><![CDATA[I have. The only thing left for me is figuring out where it's creeping from—and then let the Inquisitor deal with the source. Let him organize the mass production of my vaccine. Let him establish order and do his best to avoid more deaths. As for me, I'll leave the place.]]></string>
<string id="503679"><![CDATA[I hope we figure out who the carrier is…]]></string>
<string id="503680"><![CDATA[But this evil has no source. I feel uneasy... I'm afraid you're about to be dealt a hard blow today. ]]></string>
<string id="503681"><![CDATA[No. Won’t happen.]]></string>
<string id="503682"><![CDATA[There is always a source. ]]></string>

<string id="503837"><![CDATA[You've disobeyed my orders!]]></string>
<string id="503839"><![CDATA[At first we didn't quite realize what happened... When the screaming began, we were in no hurry to open the door. When it became apparent that something horrible was happening inside; when the banging on the doors began—we knew then that the isolation ward has succumbed to the same fate as the Termitary...]]></string>
<string id="503840"><![CDATA[We didn't! Although… something mysterious did indeed happen at night. The overseers must have been fast asleep; there was a loud creaking noise, as if the door was opened. Having woken up, they've checked the doors—only to find them firmly locked. They did catch a glimpse of what they believe to have been a feminine silhouette...]]></string>
<string id="503841"><![CDATA[Was she leaving the building? Through the door that'd been locked from the outside?]]></string>
<string id="503842"><![CDATA[Damn it... ]]></string>
<string id="503843"><![CDATA[What did you do then?]]></string>
<string id="503844"><![CDATA[The overseers saw it fit to keep the doors locked for now. The agony lasted for about an hour. The place was chock-full of people.]]></string>
<string id="503845"><![CDATA[Why was their death so fast?]]></string>
<string id="503846"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="503847"><![CDATA[It wasn't. They did not die, they were simply unable to move anymore. Those who were still capable of walking have been transported to the Theatre… I mean hospital. The feverish ones remained here. The overseers took care of them, taking the dead to Earth. They think it's their fault... that the casualty rate is almost absolute.]]></string>
<string id="503848"><![CDATA[It's terrible. ]]></string>
<string id="503849"><![CDATA[This needs to be investigated. Get on to it right now.]]></string>

<string id="503856"><![CDATA[The disease has found its way into the Cathedral. They're dying inside. Some of them are already dead.]]></string>
<string id="503857"><![CDATA[How could it happen? Have you disobeyed my orders? ]]></string>
<string id="503858"><![CDATA[No. Ask the overseers… they can describe the situation in more detail… those of them who survived, I mean… most of them have died trying to put this fire out. Although they say that… promise not to get angry?]]></string>

<string id="503861"><![CDATA[I'm too exhausted to.]]></string>
<string id="503862"><![CDATA[They say a mara sneaked into the Cathedral last night. They saw a long-armed woman wrapped in woolen rags shamble about the Cathedral, stroking the walls with her hands…]]></string>
<string id="503863"><![CDATA[That must have been some poor deranged woman.]]></string>
<string id="503864"><![CDATA[Were you an overseer last night? ]]></string>
<string id="503865"><![CDATA[So? Some beggar was looking for shelter at the Cathedral. What does it have to do with mara?]]></string>
<string id="503866"><![CDATA[And then she appeared inside the Cathedral—out of thin air, just like that. She was still wearing the rags… bits and pieces of them tore away when she began to descend. She was waving her arms, sprinkling something over the people. They said it resembled salty rain...]]></string>
<string id="503867"><![CDATA[I need to interrogate the survivors. ]]></string>
<string id="503868"><![CDATA[Calm down. I think I should indeed talk to the overseers…]]></string>
<string id="503912"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="503913"><![CDATA[Well... I had a dream that it was raining inside. I was lying on the floor, all curled up, nestling by my shivering fellow men and women... And then heavy, salty drops started falling upon my lips and eyelids! And I saw water gushing from the vaulted ceiling!]]></string>
<string id="503914"><![CDATA[A sinister dream. Let us hope it's not prophetic. ]]></string>
<string id="503915"><![CDATA[Was there anything else?]]></string>
<string id="503916"><![CDATA[Well...  It felt like a nightmare, but a nightmare that's about to end... But yeah, I mean, the dream was really scary. Water bleeding through the Cathedral roof... Come to think of it, it wasn't raining at all; it rather seemed as though the Cathedral was standing underwater and then the roof gave in… I only see nightmares, you know!]]></string>
<string id="503917"><![CDATA[What was the ending to all this?]]></string>
<string id="503918"><![CDATA[Hmm. This is a rather spot-on image of an isolation ward... A curious thing to imagine.]]></string>
<string id="503919"><![CDATA[Eh... I can't remember... Everything was about to come crumbling down, but I can't say I was all that frightened. And the people around me didn't move at all. Like they didn't care anymore! ]]></string>

<string id="503927"><![CDATA[Why would anyone do that? ]]></string>
<string id="503928"><![CDATA[Everybody knows how enamoured of the Cathedral I am. People know I come there often.

<string id="503929"><![CDATA[What happened?]]></string>
<string id="503930"><![CDATA[Tonight an unknown young woman got into the Cathedral. She walked among the sleeping and kissed their lips.

<string id="503939"><![CDATA[That matter remains mysterious. Maria believes she was recognized, but the people there refused to call her by name to protect her from imminent punishment. There are few women in our town that would be sacrificed life and soul for. Those who worship them so much could offer her shelter... out of love. ]]></string>
<string id="503940"><![CDATA[So you are a woman worthy of sacrificing life and soul for?]]></string>

However, even if this undying leviathan proves to be more than a fairy tale, the mere confirmation of his existence won't suffice to prevent the powers that be from shutting our laboratory down.

I need to figure out the most fruitful approach. Simon is a well respected man and if he mistakes my interest for effrontery it would be nigh impossible to convince him to help me break new ground in the field of human vitality.]]></string>

<string id="504864"><![CDATA[I am genuinely sorry, doctor, but our family traditions were cherished for as long as the family has existed.

Each of the clans will offer their own understanding of what is going on. Each of the three will use their own voice and the voices of their followers to lie and distort the truth. We cannot exist otherwise. However, in doing so, we will inadvertently reveal the entirety of the truth to anyone who would listen.]]></string>

Most likely we will fill you in on the negative sides of each other faction and withhold anything that is good about them. That is inevitable. None of us will stoop to outright slander, so everything that will be said will most likely be true, but this truth will be one-sided and incomplete.

<string id="504959"><![CDATA[Who's the caretaker?]]></string>
<string id="504960"><![CDATA[Since the old caretaker died… another dark story, huh… anyway, his daughter is the one who's taking care of the cemetery now. Name's Grace. She'll see to this dead man as though he was still alive and kicking… er, I mean figuratively, of course.]]></string>
<string id="504961"><![CDATA[Okay, Anna. I'll help you get rid of the body, no questions asked. I'm expecting to hear an enthralling story afterwards.]]></string>
<string id="504962"><![CDATA[I've thought it over, and here is my decision. I'll tell the Kains all about this; let them evaluate the situation on their own. You are undoubtedly in the right. It's evident.]]></string>
<string id="504966"><![CDATA[And the caretaker won't go about asking unnecessary questions?]]></string>
<string id="504967"><![CDATA[Hey, why are you so anxious all of a sudden?]]></string>
<string id="504968"><![CDATA[Is that what he told you before passing away?]]></string>
<string id="504969"><![CDATA[Well… yeah. Why are you surprised? It makes sense for him to try and explain why he barged in anyway! His story was very haphazard though… actually, he didn't say much at all. But I think I know what had happened.]]></string>
<string id="504970"><![CDATA[Perhaps. So what do we do now?]]></string>
<string id="504971"><![CDATA[You're too kind. By the way, it was Victor Kain who has sent me here to check on you and your guest. I think one of the chasers that was after the poor sod must have informed him about all this. So what do I tell him?]]></string>
<string id="504972"><![CDATA[He should be taken to the morgue. There's a good chance he'll be identified there.]]></string>
<string id="504973"><![CDATA[We don't have a morgue in the town. When someone dies, a small service is held, and then they're buried by the family. That's the local tradition. Oh, and there's been no murders since I moved here… it's just so horrible! If this is how it's going to go now… whatever happens to us?]]></string>
<string id="504974"><![CDATA[So what are you going to do now?]]></string>
<string id="504975"><![CDATA[I'll call for someone to attest to the death and take the body away.]]></string>
<string id="504977"><![CDATA[So where did he come from?]]></string>
<string id="504978"><![CDATA[Well, he isn't breathing. No pulse means dead.]]></string>
<string id="504979"><![CDATA[Where did your guest come from?]]></string>
<string id="504981"><![CDATA[Perhaps it's wiser to take the body straight to the cemetery?]]></string>
<string id="504982"><![CDATA[Oh, but I'm a weakling… I can barely lift a one-year-old baby. And why should you sweat it either? Grace can always send an undertaker cart here.]]></string>
<string id="504983"><![CDATA[All right, you'll have your cart.]]></string>
<string id="504985"><![CDATA[Wait some more. You'll dispose of him soon enough.]]></string>
<string id="504987"><![CDATA[A silver ring from your lovely finger would be more than enough.]]></string>
<string id="504988"><![CDATA[Then take it as a sign of my affection… No, wait, I've got a better idea. I'll give you several—so that they affect you even more. These are not just any trinkets. Never forget that each of them represents my feelings.]]></string>
<string id="504990"><![CDATA[I'll try.]]></string>
<string id="504999"><![CDATA[It just occurred to me that he could have killed himself.]]></string>
<string id="505000"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="505001"><![CDATA[I don't know... There's no one else that could have done it. No one, and I mean it! Neither the biggest hater nor the most desperate beggar. I mean, in his case suicide is a way more believable conjecture than murder.]]></string>
<string id="505021"><![CDATA[No, not at all. How could someone living on—or perhaps even beyond—the edge of what's humanly possible not die? At least that's what the smart people are saying. Not my ideas.]]></string>
<string id="505022"><![CDATA[So Simon loved to challenge limits and restrictions, I gather.]]></string>
<string id="505023"><![CDATA[Indeed! He loved it, and he was good at it. You could bury him underground for a couple of days, and he'd be totally fine. He was pierced with iron rods once, too. One of them broke his chest, but Simon didn't die. Tricks like these would've been incredibly popular in a circus! Oh, I miss the man...]]></string>
<string id="505024"><![CDATA[So who could have killed him? An envier?]]></string>
<string id="505025"><![CDATA[Nobody is to blame for his death. I honestly believe that Simon was doomed. What he did was too much for a single person to handle.]]></string>
<string id="505026"><![CDATA[I feel my leg being pulled.]]></string>
<string id="505105"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="505106"><![CDATA[How can I help you?]]></string>
<string id="505107"><![CDATA[Georgiy has told me everything. Which is to say he told me very little, but it was enough to astound me. He maintains that you can provide a more detailed account.]]></string>
<string id="505110"><![CDATA[There's no need to worry.]]></string>
<string id="505111"><![CDATA[Georgiy is waiting for you, my friend. He has news for you that you'll find surprising. I only ask one thing; don't be too quick to reject his request.]]></string>
<string id="505112"><![CDATA[What does he want from me?]]></string>
<string id="505113"><![CDATA[He will explain it better himself. We put too many hopes in your arrival. The echo of these hopes has lead him to offer you a rather intricate conundrum to solve.]]></string>
<string id="505114"><![CDATA[What is it?]]></string>
<string id="505115"><![CDATA[It's not exactly in your line of work—and yet, if we are to believe a certain source which we deem quite trustworthy, it appears that you are the only person that can help our family. The reward will be fitting, of course.]]></string>
<string id="505116"><![CDATA[All right, I'll speak to Georgiy.]]></string>
<string id="505117"><![CDATA[I'll think about it.]]></string>
<string id="505118"><![CDATA[You're scaring me.]]></string>
<string id="505119"><![CDATA[I don't understand.]]></string>
<string id="505120"><![CDATA[Thank you, I'll decide then and there.]]></string>
<string id="505142"><![CDATA[Why am I not allowed to examine the body? I can't work like this.]]></string>
<string id="505143"><![CDATA[Seems absurd, doesn't it? You have been asked to find the murderer, yet the circumstances of the death are being concealed from you… Our traditions are a mere excuse, you know. There's no tradition Georgiy wouldn't disregard for Simon's sake. I think there's a different reason behind my brother's inexcusable conduct...]]></string>
<string id="505144"><![CDATA[It being…?]]></string>
<string id="505145"><![CDATA[Georgiy holds your abilities in very high regard. He wants you to reconstruct the crime on your own and is reluctant to let you in on things that will change your entire worldview… probably putting you on a false trail in the process.]]></string>
<string id="505146"><![CDATA[That's some self-importance! My worldview isn't changed so easily.]]></string>
<string id="505147"><![CDATA[The cause of Simon's death is much too significant. It seems we are on the brink of a realization that will be a death warrant to all of us—and, more importantly, to our life's work. Georgiy wants to exhaust all possibilities of finding proof that he is mistaken. Find out the truth, doctor.]]></string>
<string id="505148"><![CDATA[...And he believes that an examination of the body will immediately put me off looking for alternative hypotheses?]]></string>
<string id="505149"><![CDATA[My goal is to uncover the truth. And I will, one way or another.]]></string>
<string id="505153"><![CDATA[Are you sure of that?]]></string>

<string id="505605"><![CDATA[And what exactly did you see in that dream of yours? The one that had to do with me?]]></string>
<string id="505606"><![CDATA[A truly terrifying battle is ahead of you. If no one has ever told you about your fate, I will be the first. You must know that I admire you in advance—regardless of the outcome. You will fight a foe that few can defeat.]]></string>
<string id="505607"><![CDATA[Is this a prophecy?]]></string>
<string id="505608"><![CDATA[You will clash with your foe like a dragon slayer, but your weapon will turn against you. Striking at the heart, you will end up with your own flesh torn. Every drop of blood you squeeze out of that heart will turn into a gulp of yours. If your foe escapes you, penetrates you, or saddles you, you will hear malicious laughter in your ears... and my crestfallen weeping.]]></string>

<string id="506609"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506610"><![CDATA[So, yesterday you told the Kains that we may possibly have to face an epidemic. I believe you, Bachelor. In all honesty, I am one of the few people that do. The rest are astonishingly blind!]]></string>
<string id="506611"><![CDATA[Excellent. The most important thing is that I've managed to persuade you.]]></string>
<string id="506613"><![CDATA[I have already received a report of your spectacular success. News of your deeds precedes you. Now I want you to personally convey your opinion on what you have witnessed to Kain and Olgimsky. Then we can consider your mission complete.]]></string>
<string id="506614"><![CDATA[I am listening, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="506615"><![CDATA[I've found proof, governor. Here is the key to a house where several people dying in agony are waiting for anyone willing to examine them. Will that be enough?]]></string>
<string id="506618"><![CDATA[I've changed my mind, governor. I doubt anyone but me can do the job.]]></string>
<string id="506620"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506624"><![CDATA[So what do you think? Is it unstoppable? I've started saving up pills. Tell me which ones work better.]]></string>
<string id="506626"><![CDATA[Are you daft? Do you really think pills help with every disease?]]></string>
<string id="506627"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506628"><![CDATA[One more thing. Lara was looking for you. She needs your help with something. Everyone does…]]></string>
<string id="506630"><![CDATA[I can see your intelligence is quite competent. Which houses are those?]]></string>
<string id="506631"><![CDATA[Children are lovely reporters. They remember all that's crucial to them in great detail and leave out everything else completely. As for this case, my friends have noticed a staggering amount of details—and yet they have forgotten to tell me the most important part. So I can only give you a rough direction to the area.]]></string>
<string id="506632"><![CDATA[I'd be more than grateful.]]></string>
<string id="506633"><![CDATA[It's in Earth—the troubled southern part of the town. You could use a guide down there. Find a boy named Sticky. He'll show you the houses that have fallen silent. He will also tell you what is where, so that you don't get confused.]]></string>
<string id="506634"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="506635"><![CDATA[I don't get lost easily, actually.]]></string>
<string id="506636"><![CDATA[Like it could ever be simple... What details have they noticed then?]]></string>
<string id="506637"><![CDATA[The ones you would expect the least. The silence. The moaning chorus from below the ground. Lamentations from behind the windows. Dogs banding together into packs and eating soil. The unusual smell in the air, as if a stinking cloth was burned. A friend of a friend's friend hasn't come to an appointment...]]></string>
<string id="506638"><![CDATA[I see. So what do I do? How am I supposed to look for these silent houses?]]></string>
<string id="506640"><![CDATA[Tell me... Did your father know in advance that the town was on the brink of an outbreak?]]></string>
<string id="506641"><![CDATA[What? How dare you! I will not discuss my father's actions!]]></string>
<string id="506642"><![CDATA[Pity.]]></string>
<string id="506643"><![CDATA[You are a good daughter, Victoria.]]></string>
<string id="506644"><![CDATA[And a good mistress of the house. You will see for yourself soon—I will make father redeem himself much faster than you could possibly have. You cannot intimidate him. Intrigue him? Make him sympathize with your cause? I doubt that. So let each of us do their job.]]></string>
<string id="506645"><![CDATA[Sounds convincing.]]></string>
<string id="506647"><![CDATA[Bachelor Dankovsky, the founder of Thanatica... An unexpected visit.]]></string>
<string id="506648"><![CDATA[I've seen her already.]]></string>
<string id="506651"><![CDATA[So what do you know, angel darling? Has anyone found a disease hotbed?]]></string>
<string id="506652"><![CDATA[Disturbing rumours were heard from different districts all night. Mostly inconsequential—and mostly driven by everyone's fear of the maneater and the mob's crazed vigilantism. It's all rubbish… but I've found several reports disconcerting.]]></string>
<string id="506653"><![CDATA[Which ones?]]></string>
<string id="506654"><![CDATA[They were brought to me by second-hand dealers. I've started saving up medicine, you know... ah, never mind. Anyway, everyone's noticed an unusual silence and occasional strange animal behaviour—especially that of dogs. And there were packs of rats, too! The Hunchback said that such things are often left unnoticed in the general panic.]]></string>
<string id="506655"><![CDATA[Yes, it does resemble the first signs of an outbreak. But silence could have been caused by fear. Dogs always get anxious when people do. As for rats… there is a slaughterhouse nearby, isn't there?]]></string>
<string id="506656"><![CDATA[There were other signs too. Frightening scribblings and repulsive oily spots on walls here and there. Raspy breathing that could only belong to giant lungs can be heard by the silent houses. They say the shabnak, the embodiment of the disease, is breathing poisonous air, leaving her fat on the walls as she walks by.]]></string>
<string id="506657"><![CDATA[Show me where these places are.]]></string>
<string id="506658"><![CDATA[The children know which houses are infected. There were three of them, four tops… You know what? Talk to Capella, the young Olgimskaya. Children are drawn to her like moths to a flame. They tend to hang around everywhere—and report everything to her. She's at the Lump now. And tell her I will share my pills with the children!]]></string>
<string id="506659"><![CDATA[Okay, I'll talk to Capella. You stay here and don't go anywhere.]]></string>
<string id="506660"><![CDATA[The Lump?]]></string>
<string id="506661"><![CDATA[That's what the Olgimskys' mansion is called. A large house on the riverbank, the most eye-catching building in the Gut district. It's on the southern bank of the Knots. I'll show you on the map.]]></string>
<string id="506662"><![CDATA[Thanks.]]></string>
<string id="506663"><![CDATA[It's nice to have a network of little agents all over the place. Putting aside the fact that all of them are also little deathbringers now, of course.]]></string>
<string id="506664"><![CDATA[These descriptions tell me nothing; I won't be able to find a hotbed by them. Every hour counts now.]]></string>
<string id="506665"><![CDATA[What am I supposed to do, break into every house that a rat runs by? Especially considering the rulers refuse to provide me with aids!]]></string>
<string id="506666"><![CDATA[So you're singing someone else's song, singer. Is that all?]]></string>
<string id="506667"><![CDATA[Enough. Can you show those places on a map?]]></string>
<string id="506668"><![CDATA[Rubbish? Tell me more about it.]]></string>
<string id="506669"><![CDATA[Gawd... Steppe legends that would probably seem primitive and barbaric to you. Legends of a dead crawler; of a mara that has one of her heads eating what the other has disgorged; of an oily shabnak who has had his bowels dissolved into the ground by grey-haired agas... Need I continue?]]></string>
<string id="506670"><![CDATA[Don't. Tell me about the hotbeds.]]></string>
<string id="506671"><![CDATA[I've spent a single day and a single night with you people—and I'm already doubting my own definition of barbarism; it all seems to make certain sense. Which rumours did you find disconcerting?]]></string>
<string id="506672"><![CDATA[And why the hell doesn't anyone believe me, I wonder? Yesterday they were all very busy harping on about my educated opinion being the ultimate truth to them.]]></string>

<string id="506674"><![CDATA[I've seen it all right. Shouldn't have done that... Hey, can you check me—you know, like you doctors do—just in case? Although… they say if you get sick you can feel it straight away—it feels as if someone was pouring boiling tar straight into you... Yeah.]]></string>
<string id="506675"><![CDATA[…No fever. You're fine. So have you sneaked into infected houses? Which ones?]]></string>
<string id="506676"><![CDATA[One's really close by, just across the yard. That's one freaky place, all right... All hot and smeared with bloody fat... Eeuhh... They say bloody mould was crawling up the walls during the First Outbreak too. Like a scab.]]></string>
<string id="506677"><![CDATA[All right, I'll go check.]]></string>
<string id="506678"><![CDATA[What makes you think houses like these are infected?]]></string>
<string id="506679"><![CDATA[Nothing... I'm not that sure really... But you said yesterday that Simon died of a disease, so I put two and two together. I'm not a baby, I know how things work. And I don't really believe in all that Steppe stuff, even though I live next to the Kin. My friend's father is a tanner—he says it's all hogwash too.]]></string>

<string id="506681"><![CDATA[Come, I'll show you.]]></string>

<string id="506683"><![CDATA[You don't believe in "Steppe stuff"? What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="506684"><![CDATA[I mean what I'm saying. I respect old customs and all, but trains are more convincing than rites. A lot of folks here believe in Steppe stuff. My mom also smeared our doorstep with horse milk and put bull bones into our pillows, and so what—did that do any good?]]></string>
<string id="506685"><![CDATA[All right, let's talk later, we've no time to lose.]]></string>
<string id="506686"><![CDATA[You live "next to the Kin"? What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="506687"><![CDATA[There's the Termitary, see? You should take a look at them beasts inside, all howling and whatnot. Well, everyone who lives there is a Steppe person, who sucked in that creepy stuff with their mother's milk. Do you know the tale of leather teeth? What about the one of putrid milk? Or Aga's quest for her granddaughter?]]></string>
<string id="506688"><![CDATA[No, I don't. Stay home and don't go anywhere.]]></string>
<string id="506689"><![CDATA[I should beat the living daylights out of you for that! How many of you have been to silent houses? Show me where they are. Saburov will see them blocked off.]]></string>
<string id="506690"><![CDATA[Heh, like that Saburov of yours can do a thing... Here, in Earth, Olgimsky's the man. He could make workers walk on their heads, and no one would say a word against him.]]></string>
<string id="506691"><![CDATA[Enough. I am the man now. Where are the silent houses?]]></string>
<string id="506692"><![CDATA[Are there many of you dumbheads that have been inside those houses?]]></string>
<string id="506693"><![CDATA[Not really... I'm the bravest! So not that many. Maybe half a dozen stuck around. Half a dozen more were throwing stones at the houses. I was the only one that actually sneaked inside! They could've done that afterwards though—just to outshine my feat. The doors are unlocked now, after all...]]></string>
<string id="506694"><![CDATA[Twelve... idiots. All right, I'll check what's going on in there.]]></string>
<string id="506695"><![CDATA[Where are they now?]]></string>
<string id="506696"><![CDATA[Hanging around somewhere… you can go whistle for them. I'm not their babysitter. If I see them guys, I'm supposed to send them straight to you, right?]]></string>

<string id="506698"><![CDATA[Let's pray that there's nothing bad in there.]]></string>
<string id="506699"><![CDATA[I think I know what we need to be looking for. I've heard all that stuff about a turnskin, a bloodsucker, a maneater; about it being a man and about it being a woman. I've heard the tales of an invisible many-headed beast that can go through walls. But that's all hogwash.]]></string>
<string id="506700"><![CDATA[All right, enlighten me. What else is there to find?]]></string>
<string id="506701"><![CDATA[The killer is unusual, but it exists. We need to be looking for the carrier of the disease. Right, Master?]]></string>
<string id="506702"><![CDATA[Now I hear a man talking. Who is it?]]></string>
<string id="506703"><![CDATA[A man-like creature, skin so pale that it seems to be gleaming. It comes from under the ground sometimes, turns up somewhere around the Rotten Field, between the Cemetery and the Abattoir.]]></string>
<string id="506704"><![CDATA[Have you seen it?]]></string>
<string id="506705"><![CDATA[Once. Not sure that was the thing though. We've tried to follow it a couple of times, but it always knows it's being followed. Anyway, it fits the description. A rather strange thingie. I can even imagine why folks say it has several heads.]]></string>
<string id="506706"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="506707"><![CDATA[Because it does.]]></string>
<string id="506708"><![CDATA[That was a stupid joke, boy.]]></string>
<string id="506709"><![CDATA[I won't ever believe a thing you say anymore...]]></string>
<string id="506710"><![CDATA[Rubbish.]]></string>
<string id="506711"><![CDATA[Sticky, I'm too big for this kind of games.]]></string>
<string id="506712"><![CDATA[Right. But I'll find the carrier myself.]]></string>
<string id="506713"><![CDATA[Of course it's hogwash. And I've had enough of this.]]></string>
<string id="506714"><![CDATA[There was no killer and there is no killer, boy. There was only an accident.]]></string>
<string id="506715"><![CDATA[Will you teach me to tell a person's expected lifespan by their pupils?]]></string>
<string id="506716"><![CDATA[I really hope you've quenched your thirst for acts of valour.]]></string>
<string id="506718"><![CDATA[They are panicking over nothing. Had it been the other way round, it would have been better; we would know what to be afraid of, but the people wouldn't.]]></string>
<string id="506719"><![CDATA[Over nothing? Their panic makes perfect sense.]]></string>
<string id="506720"><![CDATA[Yes, they have stopped lynching girls on a charge of cannibalism and "possession of two souls", but if the dead keep piling up, they will go looking for someone to pin that on.]]></string>
<string id="506721"><![CDATA[Perhaps not without reason.]]></string>
<string id="506722"><![CDATA[Perhaps. I hope you will help them realize their suspicions are groundless.]]></string>
<string id="506723"><![CDATA[Time will tell, governor.]]></string>
<string id="506724"><![CDATA[That depends on what happens today.]]></string>
<string id="506725"><![CDATA[We'll be able to stop the threat before the panic turns into a catastrophe, but only if I'm supported rather than stonewalled.]]></string>
<string id="506726"><![CDATA[Everything is in your hands, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="506727"><![CDATA[I know what I'm doing.]]></string>
<string id="506729"><![CDATA[People are often sharper than those who are responsible for them.]]></string>
<string id="506730"><![CDATA[The prices are rising with every passing minute. People are panicking. Isn't this reason enough for the rulers to declare a state of emerency?]]></string>
<string id="506731"><![CDATA[I have received express messages from Kain and Olgimsky. No one will dare interfere with my choices now! We are declaring quarantine. We'll create an anti-epidemic operational headquarters. I plan to assign ourselves to be its supervisors. Myself because it is my duty, you because that would be fair. We must fight shoulder to shoulder. Do you agree?]]></string>
<string id="506732"><![CDATA[It is my direct duty now as well.]]></string>
<string id="506733"><![CDATA[From now on infected districts will be blocked off. No one will leave the town until the situation is resolved. You will be allowed access to any and all areas of the town, of course. Neither Kain nor Olgimsky will have any right to stop you. You will have to provide the... population with clear instructions. Be careful about it. It's not my place to mentor you though.]]></string>
<string id="506734"><![CDATA[How are you planning to block the districts off?]]></string>
<string id="506735"><![CDATA[I will recruit volunteers. We will pick trustworthy ones—people of good standing, family men with good reputations. I will grant them the widest range of authority. They will thwart any violence or looting. They will also stop any attempts to use arms.]]></string>
<string id="506736"><![CDATA[Tell them of my special status, governor.]]></string>
<string id="506737"><![CDATA[Where and when can I be armed?]]></string>
<string id="506738"><![CDATA[Here. Take good care of it. Firearms are rare in this town. If you need a gun, your best bet would be looking for it on the black market; some townsfolk may keep makeshit, outdated, or prohibited guns... I am sure that those who do, will want to use them sooner or later. That is how we'll find them. But I have almost none at hand.]]></string>
<string id="506739"><![CDATA[That is truly regrettable... Thank you for this anyway.]]></string>
<string id="506740"><![CDATA[I have no idea how you plan to stop a frenzied mob without weapons...]]></string>
<string id="506741"><![CDATA[Of course. I will send you the text. However, I need a weapon—and the unrestricted right to use it.]]></string>
<string id="506742"><![CDATA[I need unrestricted authority, access to all districts, and a personal firearm.]]></string>
<string id="506743"><![CDATA[You will declare quarantine as soon as the train with me on board disappears in the distance.]]></string>
<string id="506744"><![CDATA[I doubt the train will leave this place, doctor. I have no right to allow the risk of pandemic. Moreover—and this should come as no surspise to you—I have received certain instructions from the Powers That Be about this. Specifically, about your departure.]]></string>
<string id="506745"><![CDATA[.....Is that so. What are you planning to do then?]]></string>
<string id="506746"><![CDATA[I'll find a way to get out of here in any case.]]></string>
<string id="506747"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506748"><![CDATA[Who is it…? Is that a person…? Will you help me…?]]></string>
<string id="506749"><![CDATA[What's wrong with you? Can't you see me?]]></string>
<string id="506750"><![CDATA[So hot... It hurts! My head… is about to burst… Blood is curdling in my veins... I'd scream, but I don't want the children to hear…]]></string>
<string id="506751"><![CDATA[There are no children here.]]></string>
<string id="506752"><![CDATA[Just... Don't kill us—don't kill them if they ask you for help... Their mind is clouded with pain... They can't even find each other... They're only praying... Don't come close to them... And step away from me too.]]></string>
<string id="506753"><![CDATA[We don't have much time left! Hurry...]]></string>
<string id="506754"><![CDATA[I want to ease your suffering.]]></string>
<string id="506762"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506765"><![CDATA[See what you've done, doctor... You won't be able to leave this place now. The town is blocked off. I've transferred my powers over to Saburov. He didn't hesitate to express his gratitude by assigning me to the position of an... intendant. Now I'm in charge of equipping and maintaining infirmaries...]]></string>
<string id="506766"><![CDATA[I'm not planning to leave.]]></string>
<string id="506767"><![CDATA[It is. The Station is shut off... but it will be reopened when a regular freight train arrives. It will definitely be, doctor... That's when we'll discuss how to… snatch ourselves a vehicle there.]]></string>
<string id="506768"><![CDATA[Thank you, but I have no plans to leave at the moment. Especially no illegal plans.]]></string>
<string id="506769"><![CDATA[Pity. I wanted to ask a favour of you in return... but I will do that later, later... I want you to get to know your new allies better... the Kains and the Saburovs... Otherwise it will be less dramatic.]]></string>
<string id="506770"><![CDATA[We will have an opportunity to come to an agreement.]]></string>
<string id="506771"><![CDATA[I have no desire to do business with you, boös Vlad.]]></string>
<string id="506773"><![CDATA[When is the train scheduled to arrive?]]></string>
<string id="506774"><![CDATA[Any day now... In fact, it was supposed to arrive some time ago... I'm surprised it hasn't... The government has to realise how dependant we are on their deliveries... Our survival is at risk here.]]></string>
<string id="506775"><![CDATA[Your survival is at risk for an entirely different reason.]]></string>
<string id="506776"><![CDATA[Then do protect the supplies, dear intendant.]]></string>
<string id="506777"><![CDATA[I'm sure the train is not the only line of communication with the rest of the world.]]></string>
<string id="506778"><![CDATA[You would like to inspect the Termitary? Did I hear you right?]]></string>
<string id="506779"><![CDATA[I would. I have a strong suspicion that the disease could have gotten inside.]]></string>
<string id="506780"><![CDATA[You need not go to the Termitary... Even if you manage to get past the guards, you'll be ripped apart inside. It is hard for you to imagine what it's like in there. They sleep on the floor hugging bulls... It's all a big stable. They can't even talk, they only howl and whine...]]></string>
<string id="506781"><![CDATA[Was it you that have brought them to this state?]]></string>
<string id="506782"><![CDATA[Come now... this is their natural state. They are half-men, half-animals. The Termitary is inhabited by a single creature—the Kin. It takes skill to communicate with them… Yes. Skill.]]></string>
<string id="506783"><![CDATA[You have convinced me.]]></string>
<string id="506784"><![CDATA[I must insist nonetheless.]]></string>
<string id="506785"><![CDATA[The Termitary... And the whole Project... are my domain, doctor. And I have told you more than once already that I don't like it when anyone interferes with my domain. The Termitary will not be unlocked without my consent. You keep it in mind... If there really is a threat of an epidemic... I'll take advantage of the situation and keep it blocked... to avoid unnecessary unrest.]]></string>
<string id="506786"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="506787"><![CDATA[This sounds rather suspicious...]]></string>
<string id="506788"><![CDATA[You have peculiar working conditions.]]></string>
<string id="506793"><![CDATA[No. I have absolutely no desire to knock on that coffin.]]></string>
<string id="506794"><![CDATA[I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="506795"><![CDATA[Tell me, boös Vlad, what's going on in the Termitary at the moment?]]></string>
<string id="506797"><![CDATA[You're thinking of leaving this inhospitable place, aren't you? Old Kain and his whims must be getting on your nerves already...]]></string>
<string id="506798"><![CDATA[I like Kain. I understand his motives and hold no grudges. Furthermore, he has a charming niece.]]></string>
<string id="506799"><![CDATA[Well, anyway... It wasn't I that has ordered to shut the Station down; the order came from the Crucible. You see… Kain does have the right. Even though I am and have always been in charge of the train services… So that is rather disrespectful.]]></string>
<string id="506800"><![CDATA[Are you implying that you could have helped me find a vehicle if not for Kain abusing his power?]]></string>
<string id="506801"><![CDATA[Why... it's a matter of respect. Don't get me wrong. I don't like Kain taking over my domain even if he does technically have the right to… I understand family sentiments. Going after the killer is a rather honourable endeavour… But I have a feeling this killer won't be leaving the town by train.]]></string>
<string id="506802"><![CDATA[I have a suspicion that there might be an epidemic. Have you heard about it?]]></string>
<string id="506803"><![CDATA[Right... Let's get this settled straight away and not come back to the subject again... I am a businessman. I work with facts rather than ideas, suspicions, or theories. I'll help you leave the town as soon as you find a way to... calm Kain down.]]></string>
<string id="506804"><![CDATA[I'll keep that in mind.]]></string>
<string id="506805"><![CDATA[I'll find a way to persuade him.]]></string>
<string id="506806"><![CDATA[What makes you think so? Do you know something?]]></string>
<string id="506807"><![CDATA[Why doesn't it sit well with you?]]></string>
<string id="506809"><![CDATA[Yes, my work here is done.]]></string>
<string id="506810"><![CDATA[The Station is shut off, and yet you're willing to help me get out of here? Why?]]></string>
<string id="506811"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506829"><![CDATA[I feel guilty for having misled you, dear Bachelor. Forgive this old man... I thought your ignorance of our local affairs would mystically skew the circumstances in your favour. Forgive me if I was wrong. There is no unexpected news to be heard, is there?]]></string>
<string id="506830"><![CDATA[No. The disease is spreading around the town already. It is necessary that we urgently appoint mid-level executives. Get all the doctors and hospital attendants.]]></string>
<string id="506831"><![CDATA[Let Saburov take care of that. After all, he was the one to demand emergency powers from us, which were granted. I've already sent all of my men to assist him, as well as an appreciable amount of money to further his administrative activities. We don't have any doctors or hospital attendants. The only man that knows something about medicine is currently examining my brother's body. It is strange there's been no news from him so far... We need to send someone after him.]]></string>
<string id="506832"><![CDATA[And what about you? What are you going to do?]]></string>
<string id="506833"><![CDATA[We will fight... until the very end. I will personally persecute those who would dare describe this disease as some kind of preordained divine retribution! I will attack anyone who would say Simon got what he deserved! Finally, I will not allow anyone to say that what Simon has built by ceaseless labour is subject to inevitable destruction.]]></string>
<string id="506834"><![CDATA[Retribution for what?]]></string>
<string id="506835"><![CDATA[Sooner or later the one who dares challenge the mechanics of nature will pay the price. But this is not something we'd want to believe, is it? This is a conclusion drawn by people who tend to mistake their exhaustion for wisdom. However, even an echo would sometimes grow to become deafening noise. If people keep saying we're doomed, they might well bring about our extinction. ]]></string>
<string id="506836"><![CDATA[What now, Judge?]]></string>
<string id="506837"><![CDATA[We're not that different from each other, dear Bachelor. I am grateful for everything you've done for us, I appreciate the risk you took to help us, and I am much obliged for the disheartening conclusion you have reached. No matter what you are going to do, you can count on our full support. The reward we have promised you will be duly delivered. Victor will make all the necessary arrangements.]]></string>
<string id="506838"><![CDATA[Thank you, Judge. I must take my leave now.]]></string>
<string id="506839"><![CDATA[I won't leave you on your own in this battle, Georgiy. We have a common foe and we will fight this foe together.]]></string>
<string id="506840"><![CDATA[I would never draw a conclusion like this. That would bring my whole lifework to naught.]]></string>
<string id="506841"><![CDATA[Everything that I have seen here makes me think this is the case.]]></string>
<string id="506842"><![CDATA[I can only wish you luck.]]></string>
<string id="506843"><![CDATA[Is it really inevitable? So this omnipresent fatalism is in your nature too?]]></string>
<string id="506844"><![CDATA[What news did you expect?]]></string>
<string id="506845"><![CDATA[Till the very last moment I hoped that my brother's demise was of... mechanical nature. That he had suffered a violent death. I was waiting so eagerly for it to be proven. The cause of his death will undoubtedly become the reason all of us will die. So it's the Plague after all... Even if it were the nail-eater, an evil spirit of the Steppe legends, the fight would have been easier. ]]></string>
<string id="506846"><![CDATA[Will you fight?]]></string>
<string id="506847"><![CDATA[At first I thought the loss had broken your spirit.]]></string>
<string id="506848"><![CDATA[In all honesty, it drives me mad to be a pawn in someone else's covert game. What the hell did I risk my hide for?]]></string>
<string id="506849"><![CDATA[I hold no grudges. Perhaps I would have done the same if I were you.]]></string>
<string id="506850"><![CDATA[Do we still have a shred of hope?]]></string>
<string id="506851"><![CDATA[There is going to be an outbreak in the town. Face the truth, Judge. We cannot bring your brother back, but we can avert another tragedy.]]></string>
<string id="506852"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506853"><![CDATA[Is it true? The thing you've found out? You don't have to comfort me—just tell me if it's true. Is there a hope that you're wrong?]]></string>
<string id="506854"><![CDATA[I've learned a lot of things in the last couple of days that I would have never considered to be true before…]]></string>
<string id="506855"><![CDATA[My heart is beating so heavily... It's about to jump out!]]></string>
<string id="506856"><![CDATA[Andrey has agreed, but he won't leave without Peter, and Peter doesn't want to go anywhere.]]></string>
<string id="506857"><![CDATA[I'll try to persuade him... but I don't think I'll succeed. Maria would do much better though... Do you think she may agree to help?]]></string>
<string id="506858"><![CDATA[Is there no other way? I don't think I should discuss our escape with... Maria Kaina.]]></string>
<string id="506859"><![CDATA[Well, Eva, everyone is ready. We found a way to win Peter over.]]></string>
<string id="506860"><![CDATA[Then let Andrey take care of the rest and make us ready for the departure. Just tell him that we must hurry—any minute can become our last... If it begins just like it began during the First Outbreak, we won't even manage to get to the Knots.... Oh god, oh my god...]]></string>
<string id="506861"><![CDATA[Why didn't you come?]]></string>
<string id="506862"><![CDATA[How awful... I have fainted... I didn't sleep during the day at all, I was so anxious... Forgive me! Is it too late? Can we go?]]></string>
<string id="506863"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506864"><![CDATA[Sit. Take a load off your feet.]]></string>
<string id="506865"><![CDATA[Eva wants to flee the town before it's too late. She said only you can make that happen.]]></string>
<string id="506866"><![CDATA[Flee? Why in the world? Have yesterday's murders scared her so much? No one will dare lay a finger on her!]]></string>
<string id="506867"><![CDATA[A killer more dangerous than a Steppe spirit is at large. There will be an epidemic, Andrey. Rubin told me it's called the "Sand Pest". Does it ring any bells?]]></string>
<string id="506868"><![CDATA[Peter doesn't believe me either! What's wrong with you people? How can I persuade him?]]></string>
<string id="506869"><![CDATA[And rightly so. Take a look around. You should have seen what the Crude Sprawl looked like during the outbreak! The houses that Burakh had locked up were literally in agony, their walls swollen with boils, their windows covered in scarlet mould. There were blisters everywhere; blood mixed with ichor was flowing from the chimneys... That's how it was.]]></string>
<string id="506870"><![CDATA[Your brother has agreed.]]></string>
<string id="506871"><![CDATA[Well, don't let the door hit our asses on our way then. There are plenty more shitholes in the world. I might need a gun though. Do you have a weapon?]]></string>
<string id="506872"><![CDATA[Where were you? Why didn't you come?]]></string>
<string id="506873"><![CDATA[Some shithead patrolmen came here. They were tipped off! I managed to break an arm to one of them, but the others brought me down. The bastards hit hard... They collared my brother at the bridge and made him come home. Eva is unconscious.]]></string>
<string id="506874"><![CDATA[All set. We're armed.]]></string>
<string id="506875"><![CDATA[Okay. Let's meet by the Station at 10 PM. Don't get too close to the engine though.]]></string>
<string id="506876"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506877"><![CDATA[I can't shrug away the feeling that someone's scratching at the window sill...]]></string>
<string id="506878"><![CDATA[Your brother suggests we escape this place.]]></string>
<string id="506879"><![CDATA[Escape? This place? Is he out of his mind?]]></string>
<string id="506880"><![CDATA[A plague is about to break out here—the local Sand Plague strain, to be more precise. There are no medical records of it. However, you seem to have had the pleasure of witnessing it in action.]]></string>
<string id="506881"><![CDATA[...I don't care. My body is so full of twyrine that no disease will ever be able to even approach, let alone touch me. Same with brother Andrey... unless he gets it from his wenches. No, I'm not leaving this place…]]></string>
<string id="506883"><![CDATA[Bloody hell... Are you sure about this?]]></string>
<string id="506884"><![CDATA[Why did none of you come?]]></string>
<string id="506885"><![CDATA[The patrol got us. They collared me right in the street, and I think my rib is broken. They have heavy fists... sons of butchers.]]></string>
<string id="506886"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506887"><![CDATA[You're giving me a stony stare. Is something wrong? Are you disappointed?]]></string>
<string id="506888"><![CDATA[Tell me, Maria, do you have any influence on Peter Stamatin?]]></string>
<string id="506889"><![CDATA[He has a greater influence on me. Why do you ask?]]></string>
<string id="506890"><![CDATA[I want to persuade the brothers Stamatin to leave for the Capital, but Peter doesn't want to. How can I convince him?]]></string>
<string id="506891"><![CDATA[You want to take the Stamatins away from here? And you're asking me to help? You are obviously out of your mind... Who do you think I am? Oh, I see. You're laughing at me; but I'm too anxious now to smile at a good joke...]]></string>
<string id="506892"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506893"><![CDATA[There's panic everywhere, right? The prices are rising by the hour—not to mention that we haven't received any provisions for several months. The shops are empty. The people are eager to buy anything at exorbitant prices. Everyone is trying to prepare themselves for the epidemic.]]></string>
<string id="506894"><![CDATA[You're not going anywhere. It's a general rule, Lara: those who stay in, survive. Those who go around shopping, die. Get it?]]></string>
<string id="506895"><![CDATA[I need to collect Vlad the Younger's, Yulia's, and Maria Kaina's donations. Tell them that you are acting on my behalf. Then you'll need to find the best prices and buy as much bread, smoked meat, and fish as possible—only the products that don't go bad quickly! You'll need to take it all to the House of the Living. I'll show you where it is.]]></string>
<string id="506896"><![CDATA[Is that what you're calling the future shelter? A lovely name.]]></string>
<string id="506897"><![CDATA[Thank you. And forgive me for burdening you with time-consuming and mundane errands. But one day a lot of people will be very thankful that we've managed to take care of the vital issues beforehand…]]></string>
<string id="506898"><![CDATA[I know.]]></string>
<string id="506900"><![CDATA[I've obtained the rations. But there are very odd orderlies standing by the house you've directed me at. They're using theatrical masks and costumes as disease protection. As far as I understood…]]></string>
<string id="506901"><![CDATA[Yes, I know... The House of the Living will have to be relocated here. Remember that you're always welcome at the Shelter. We'll preserve the stock, distributing the food in small portions; we will make it. I hope it all ends soon…]]></string>
<string id="506902"><![CDATA[Here is what you asked for.]]></string>
<string id="506903"><![CDATA[Is this all you've managed to buy?]]></string>
<string id="506905"><![CDATA[I managed to buy very little. The shopowners are demanding a cart of grain's worth for a loaf of bread.]]></string>
<string id="506906"><![CDATA[We need more. There are shops that throw goods out at bargain prices from time to time—it's because people say that requisitions are to begin soon. Please, you're our only hope! Everyone I set on this mission have brought twice as little as required.]]></string>
<string id="506907"><![CDATA[I'll try to work a miracle.]]></string>
<string id="506909"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506910"><![CDATA[Everyone's dead here, see? No one knows why. Perhaps it's an echo of yesterday's vendetta… We're a bit at a loss about this loss ourselves.]]></string>
<string id="506911"><![CDATA[What am I supposed to do with the provisions?]]></string>
<string id="506912"><![CDATA[The dead have no use for it. Give your offerings to Lara. Wasn't it she that asked you to bring food? She wanted to call her shelter the House of the Living, didn't she?]]></string>
<string id="506913"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="506914"><![CDATA[What is going on in the town? I wish I could go out and see for myself...]]></string>
<string id="506915"><![CDATA[I've come on Lara Ravel's request.]]></string>
<string id="506916"><![CDATA[Oh, true... She did say that she needed to buy some provisions; stock up on drinking water and whatnot... Some couriers have offered their services to me already, and then there was this profiteering peddler who visited yesterday. The mind boggles. Just to think that all this hullabaloo was caused by the death of one single man...]]></string>
<string id="506917"><![CDATA[There is an epidemic hazard; the disease we are about to face is likely to be more terrible than plague, Yulia. One man's death has nothing to do with it.]]></string>
<string id="506918"><![CDATA[Lara wanted to meet you to collect the donations for the House of the Living. I prohibited her from going outside—and I strongly advise you against doing so.]]></string>
<string id="506919"><![CDATA[Yes, I'm giving her my personal savings. I tried to persuade my father to spare some money from the family funds, but they still refuse to believe in the outbreak. That is just the family line at the moment.]]></string>
<string id="506920"><![CDATA[Unfortunately, I have.]]></string>
<string id="506921"><![CDATA[Not yet.]]></string>
<string id="506922"><![CDATA[Tell my father about it as soon as possible! If it isn't too late, tell him that I ordered to donate some money to captain Ravel's daughter for the foundation of a shelter. He won't refuse, he will probably offer to donate some himself.]]></string>

<string id="506925"><![CDATA[Lara Ravel is trying to set up a shelter where people could hide from the disease. She needs money. Your daughter has asked you to help.]]></string>
<string id="506926"><![CDATA[Is that so? Hmm, so the canny Bound are preparing for the epidemic already. Lara Ravel... she's the executed captain's daughter, isn't she?]]></string>
<string id="506927"><![CDATA[I don't know.]]></string>

<string id="507034"><![CDATA[We still have a few precious hours to stop the disease from spreading, just like Isidor Burakh did a few years ago. We need to declare a state of emergency. But I can't do anything. My hands are tied.]]></string>
<string id="507035"><![CDATA[You are the authority. What is barring you from declaring a state of emergency and being proactive?]]></string>
<string id="507036"><![CDATA[The authority belongs to the triumvirate that is presided over by the Patron—the head ruler. But now that Simon is dead his place is vacant. Georgiy and Vlad are too afraid that the old balance might shift. But these tragic events are reconfiguring the local power landscape.]]></string>
<string id="507037"><![CDATA[And?]]></string>
<string id="507038"><![CDATA[If I declare a state of emergency at my own discretion, there will be a feud. A civil strife. I need them to acknowledge me at least. To take further action, I need the Olgimskys' money and the Kains' standing. I need Big Vlad's cunning and Georgiy's energy. I also need their servants to follow my orders.]]></string>
<string id="507039"><![CDATA[Why won't they make concessions to you? It's glaringly obvious that every minute counts. Else the town will die. What are they going to rule then?]]></string>
<string id="507040"><![CDATA[It's their damned infantilism... One of them is a greedy child, another is a whimsical one. They think that if they admit that there is an outbreak in town, it will actually happen, but as long as they refuse to believe it, it simply doesn't exist. It's either megalomania or cunning calculation.]]></string>
<string id="507041"><![CDATA[Ridiculous…]]></string>
<string id="507042"><![CDATA[By the way, speaking of the Kains' power... They may be right after a fashion… Seems like their will has a certain hidden influence on the world. Things they believe in become closer and somehow more real.]]></string>
<string id="507043"><![CDATA[What can I do to convince them?]]></string>
<string id="507044"><![CDATA[How can I help you though?]]></string>
<string id="507045"><![CDATA[Find proof! Any proof. Immediately. While Rubin tampers with the body—and he'll be busy with it for a long time since he's not a professional—the initiative will be lost. Help me, Dankovsky! Find factual proof, show it to them, and they won't be able to deny the truth any longer.]]></string>
<string id="507046"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="507047"><![CDATA[I've asked several people I trust for help. Perhaps they have already offered to help you too? Some of them have sent word to me already. Furthermore, Anna, the current owner of the Willows, is positive that she knows how to find irrefutable proof of the outbreak. She needs a competent person to assist her.]]></string>
<string id="507048"><![CDATA[Well, come to an agreement then! Time is of the essence.]]></string>
<string id="507049"><![CDATA[We have already exchanged opinions, and they have stated theirs quite clearly. The answer is no. They fail to see the obvious—or refuse to, perhaps. However, my decisions will be useless if the Kains and the Olgimskys keep sabotaging them . We can only instill order and catch the disease before it runs wild if we unite.]]></string>
<string id="507051"><![CDATA[Who is in charge of maintaining order in the town?]]></string>
<string id="507052"><![CDATA[I am. For many years the Saburovs have held executive power in their hands. The problem is that, until now, we haven't had a serious reason to enforce it. In times of peace the scale tipped to favour the legislative branch—that is, the Kains.]]></string>
<string id="507053"><![CDATA[What is preventing you from using your power now?]]></string>
<string id="507054"><![CDATA[How can I persuade Kain and Olgimsky?]]></string>
<string id="507055"><![CDATA[Why don't you assign volunteers or mercenaries to the task?]]></string>
<string id="507056"><![CDATA[The heads of the families won't trust my mercenaries; but they will trust you. Firstly, your impeccable honesty got you in trouble in the Capital, and that is as good a credential as any. Secondly, you are new to our town and cannot be acting on anyone's behalf.]]></string>
<string id="507057"><![CDATA[Very well, I'm convinced. How are you planning to look for proof?]]></string>
<string id="507058"><![CDATA[Fine. I'll speak to her.]]></string>
<string id="507059"><![CDATA[Looking for infection hotspots is a dangerous job.]]></string>
<string id="507060"><![CDATA[Undoubtedly. This is why I'm asking you—if you would offer your assistance at all, of course—to get there before the people that are prepared to risk their lives for public wellbeing do. They probably have no idea of how to ensure their own safety in a situation like this. Talk them out of it before it's too late.]]></string>
<string id="507061"><![CDATA[Of course I will. Don't worry about that.]]></string>
<string id="507062"><![CDATA[If I manage to get there in time. It's their personal choice to risk their lives, after all.]]></string>
<string id="507063"><![CDATA[I haven't offered my assistance yet. Why should I waste my time engaging in dubious ventures?]]></string>
<string id="507064"><![CDATA[Time is of the essense. Anna knows how to recognize the places where you can observe the proof of your hypothesis with your very eyes. If we are to localize the epidemic, it's essential to find and cordon off those places. It's strange that I have to explain that to you.]]></string>
<string id="507065"><![CDATA[I'll think about it.]]></string>
<string id="507066"><![CDATA[What do you intend to do?]]></string>
<string id="507067"><![CDATA[Sadly, this is now my direct duty. I received a letter from the Powers That Be testifying to that extent. What steps are you planning to take?]]></string>
<string id="507068"><![CDATA[Do what you think is apt. I only ask two things of you. First of all, take good care of yourself. Drink. Eat. Sleep. Be careful. I'm afraid many will take advantage of this situation to either settle old accounts or fulfil their hidden agendas. Secondly, spare those lives that can be spared.]]></string>
<string id="507069"><![CDATA[Thank you for the advice. Although I must admit it's rather useless given the situation…]]></string>

<string id="507086"><![CDATA[But why?]]></string>
<string id="507087"><![CDATA[There is a certain… political subtlety to this... If you're right, my dear doctor, "the labour of our life is condemned", as our Judge likes to say… Let's wait and see… Rubin is working on Simon, isn't he? He is. No troubling news from him so far.]]></string>
<string id="507088"><![CDATA[If I am right and you keep sitting on your hands, you will be condemned regardless of whether you admit to my rightness or not. But if you do, we will have a chance to curb the threat.]]></string>

<string id="507091"><![CDATA[Fine. I'll find a way to convince you.]]></string>

<string id="507100"><![CDATA[Pray forgive me... You're asking too many questions... You have come to see Simon. Simon is dead. You are more than eager to get back to your research.

<string id="507101"><![CDATA[Okay… so it is.]]></string>
<string id="507102"><![CDATA[I don't suppose you are aware of the orders I received this morning. My duty now is to stay here until the threat of an epidemic is neutralized.]]></string>

<string id="507104"><![CDATA[I already have.]]></string>
<string id="507105"><![CDATA[SCALPEL. A large cartilage scalpel. Can be used as a close combat weapon. Not very easy to handle, but very effective due to its sharpness. Deals the most damage when attacking from the front. Frequent use causes it to dull quickly.]]></string>
<string id="507106"><![CDATA[KNIFE. An ordinary meat-cutting knife. Can be used as a melee weapon. Not as good as a sharp scalpel in a face to face fight, but can instantly kill if stabbing the back. Becomes dull and brittle after about half a hundred blows.]]></string>
<string id="507108"><![CDATA[RIFLE. An outdated model of army rifle. Powerful, reliable, and long-ranged, it became a favorite of soldiers and craftsmen during the latest war. Is light and has a soft recoil. A useful weapon for long-range combat. Its main drawback is the slow rate of fire.]]></string>
<string id="507109"><![CDATA[REVOLVER. A six-round semi-automatic revolver. Employed by certain special units in the active army. Accurate and has a good fire rate, but only limited penetrative power. Easy to handle with weak recoil and good balance. Such revolvers are a rarity in modern times.]]></string>
<string id="507112"><![CDATA[REVOLVER AMMO. A revolver bullet with a round nose. Steel jacket, steel core. A relatively rare type of round. It's recommended to use it sparingly.]]></string>
<string id="507113"><![CDATA[A five-liter canister of flamethrower fuel.]]></string>
<string id="507114"><![CDATA[RIFLE AMMO. This ammo is for long-barrelled rifles. The heavy bullet with a lead core in a steel jacket is highly lethal at long distances. Fired from the army rifle.]]></string>

<string id="507116"><![CDATA[I do not wish to believe this! I need the truth, but I need it proven, not based on revelations. If what you say is true, doctor, the labour of our life is condemned. We will seek a different answer till the very end.]]></string>

<string id="507123"><![CDATA[I'll bring you the proof you need!]]></string>
<string id="507124"><![CDATA[I'll bring you the proof you need!]]></string>
<string id="507125"><![CDATA[But what for? You said you trust my opinion. Well, here it is: Simon has died of plague!]]></string>
<string id="507126"><![CDATA[Admitting he died like that means letting the killer escape. If we acknowledge that no murder took place, the murderer will have a chance to flee. I need to know what exactly it was that sufficed to end Simon's life. Do not mistake it for senile obstinacy, doctor! It's my final attempt to save us all.]]></string>
<string id="507127"><![CDATA[I have a letter from the Powers That Be. They are also writing about an epidemic. Don't you find it convincing?]]></string>
<string id="507128"><![CDATA[I don't. The domain of the Powers That Be is somewhere above us. They don't understand us and treat us as if we were their toys. I have no desire to give heed to them. Besides, weren't you the one to have suffered their idiocy in the first place? What makes you give any currency to their opinion now?]]></string>

<string id="507162"><![CDATA[The Sand Dirt! Is it true? Has Simon died of the Sand Pest?]]></string>
<string id="507164"><![CDATA[Why won't they?]]></string>
<string id="507165"><![CDATA[What?! Is that what Rubin said? Bullshit. Five years ago it spread like fire in a dry forest. Burakh managed to grab it by the tail back then. If it were the Sand Plague again, drama queens would have spread it all over the place yesterday. The town would have been crammed full of dead men by today.]]></string>
<string id="507166"><![CDATA[Really?]]></string>
<string id="507167"><![CDATA[On the other hand, Eva is somewhat right… Yeah! It's time to leave the place. Yesterday's orgy was disgusting. The fight for the throne is about to begin, and I don't want to see its consequences. We can't stay here any longer. Are you with us?]]></string>
<string id="507168"><![CDATA[So we're leaving?]]></string>
<string id="507169"><![CDATA[If my brother agrees, of course. I am obviously not going anywhere without him.]]></string>
<string id="507170"><![CDATA[I'll speak to him.]]></string>

<string id="507172"><![CDATA[Anyone who touches her will have to deal with me afterwards. That's reason enough already.]]></string>
<string id="507173"><![CDATA[Does dealing with you feel that bad?]]></string>
<string id="507174"><![CDATA[It ends in various types of bloodshed, massacres, and broken spines. I don't kill people, but I will break the neck to anyone who dares attack a woman.]]></string>
<string id="507175"><![CDATA[Hopefully there won't be an opportunity for me to witness that.]]></string>
<string id="507176"><![CDATA[How has Isidor managed to do that?]]></string>
<string id="507177"><![CDATA[He acted very resolutely. Burakh locked and boarded up every infected house. It was a miracle. The old man used to have a brilliant intuition... Why do you ask?]]></string>
<string id="507178"><![CDATA[Because the Sand Plague—or whatever it's called—has come to your town.]]></string>
<string id="507179"><![CDATA[Professional curiosity,]]></string>
<string id="507180"><![CDATA[So, you and Rubin do mean that? No, that's impossible. Had Simon died because of that, none of the Kains would still be alive by now. Rubin is mistaken.]]></string>
<string id="507181"><![CDATA[Eva thinks otherwise. Will you help her leave?]]></string>
<string id="507182"><![CDATA[Let's hope you're right. Forget about this conversation.]]></string>
<string id="507183"><![CDATA[Metaphors...]]></string>
<string id="507184"><![CDATA[No. I'm not being metaphoric, these are the facts. There was moaning and howling all over Earth—moaning louder than the mourning siren at the Works. The tormented were screaming so loudly glass would break in the windows—and it all happened over the course of several hours. That is what the Sand Pest is. So knock your bullshit off.]]></string>
<string id="507185"><![CDATA[Okay. What can persuade Peter?]]></string>
<string id="507186"><![CDATA[A convincing discovery supporting your theory could help. That outbreak has left a dreary impression on Peter. He's been heavily into twyrine since then; but there is no Sand Plague in town, so... poor you. Tell Eva that the plan fell through because of Peter. Perhaps that will comfort her.]]></string>
<string id="507187"><![CDATA[I'll look for this discovery of yours.]]></string>
<string id="507188"><![CDATA[I'll communicate that to Eva.]]></string>
<string id="507189"><![CDATA[How was it stopped?]]></string>
<string id="507190"><![CDATA[Burakh did something. It was all over before anyone could realize what had happened. The dead were cremated. They even tried to save someone, I think.]]></string>
<string id="507191"><![CDATA[So what am I supposed to tell Eva?]]></string>
<string id="507192"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="507193"><![CDATA[I could use more.]]></string>
<string id="507194"><![CDATA[Right. Let's do the preparations separately then. Here's some money. The black market around here is run by a mongrel calling himself Bad Grief… Have you met the rodent already?]]></string>
<string id="507195"><![CDATA[I have an armory. If only I knew what enemy I'm arming myself against...]]></string>
<string id="507196"><![CDATA[Then we need to buy ammo. By the way, these old cavalry revolvers are verified to misfire often. You'd be better off carrying several guns, just like in the good old days. When one of them fails, another will work.]]></string>
<string id="507197"><![CDATA[Where can I buy them? There are no guns or ammo for sale, I've been looking all over.]]></string>
<string id="507198"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="507199"><![CDATA[You can always find human-killing stuff at Grief's. Now then. He'll obviously try to rob you as best he can, but you only need to say "Andrey is off to the kennel" to him and he'll change the tune immediately. He may even give you something for free.]]></string>
<string id="507200"><![CDATA[No, I didn't have time for it.]]></string>

<string id="507203"><![CDATA[Okay. Then what?]]></string>
<string id="507204"><![CDATA[Then you come back. Meanwhile I'll try to think of a way to get on Gugong's good side.]]></string>
<string id="507205"><![CDATA[Who's Gugong?]]></string>
<string id="507206"><![CDATA[One of the locals—a deaf-and-dumb train driver. Not quite human. Made of soil and bones, glued together with sticky blood and inspired with thick twyrine—just like all his Steppe brethren. I'd break his neck, but the engine wouldn't go anywhere without him... Don't you frown, I'll deal with him.]]></string>
<string id="507207"><![CDATA[That is fortunate.]]></string>
<string id="507208"><![CDATA[Whoa! What does that phrase mean?]]></string>
<string id="507209"><![CDATA[An old business of ours. It means that he forgot who I was while I was busy drinking in this den.]]></string>
<string id="507210"><![CDATA[All right. Then what?]]></string>
<string id="507211"><![CDATA[It's a deal.]]></string>
<string id="507212"><![CDATA[I won't.]]></string>
<string id="507213"><![CDATA[See you then.]]></string>
<string id="507214"><![CDATA[Damn it...]]></string>
<string id="507216"><![CDATA[Incidentally, are you aware that no one believes you? Seems like Saburov the despot was the only significant person to have sided with you. He could have prevented the disaster, but it's too late now!]]></string>
<string id="507217"><![CDATA[I've come on Saburov's behalf. Real proof is required for the rulers to devolve their powers to him and begin cooperating. And you know where to find it, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="507218"><![CDATA[Oh, it's all such a mess… we've been living a very quiet life for a while, we're not used to... A lot of people were killed yesterday, you know… I still can't believe it. It's like a pagan demon had passed through the town, possessing the crowd, committing foul murder, and somehow remaining invisible...]]></string>

<string id="507242"><![CDATA[What, is she supposed to refashion her own home into a lazar house now?]]></string>

<string id="507252"><![CDATA[Yes, you're right.]]></string>
<string id="507253"><![CDATA[No. Do I look like an actor? I'm, like, the opposite of an actor. I've merely borrowed this outfit, you see. It covers the face and... hmm... offers some sort of protection. Moreover, it conceals the disgusting sights and gets rid of the omnipresent stench!]]></string>
<string id="507254"><![CDATA[Sorry, what?]]></string>
<string id="507255"><![CDATA[The mask has no eye openings, only these narrow slits. See? It's like I'm squinting. And there are ground grains saturated with twyrine brew in the beak. They kill microbes and get rid of the smell.]]></string>

<string id="507267"><![CDATA[Then we need to run away from here, Daniil. Immediately! Even if we have to move exclusively by foot—we need to go now! We will die in the Steppe, of course, but at least it won't be as excruciating!]]></string>
<string id="507268"><![CDATA[Fine. I'm sick of this place anyway. When is the train leaving?]]></string>
<string id="507269"><![CDATA[I can't leave, Eva. But I can help you leave.]]></string>
<string id="507270"><![CDATA[No... I won't leave this place without you. But we can't stay here! I'm not afraid of death, you know. I once jumped off a building site and only survived by a miracle. But I don't want to die... of this…! Please! Let us all leave!]]></string>
<string id="507271"><![CDATA[A freight train full of meat, leather, and raw materials departs from the Station every month. Women of the Kin bid it farewell with sorrowful songs and mourning—that's the ritual...]]></string>

<string id="507273"><![CDATA[Tell me how we can get away from here.]]></string>
<string id="507274"><![CDATA[All of us won't fit into even the longest of trains. Calm down, Eva, I'm staying here.]]></string>
<string id="507275"><![CDATA[So what?]]></string>
<string id="507276"><![CDATA[What do you suggest?]]></string>
<string id="507277"><![CDATA[I came here without any additional rituals, and I am planning to leave the place in the same fashion.]]></string>
<string id="507278"><![CDATA[But you haven't touched the bull meat train. It's an entirely different thing.]]></string>
<string id="507279"><![CDATA[Can we bargain with the driver?]]></string>
<string id="507280"><![CDATA[No. He's deaf-and-dumb. Moreover, he's not quite a man. His position is sacred to him... There is a way out though. I think I know of a man who could intimidate even a deaf-and-dumb odongh...]]></string>
<string id="507281"><![CDATA[Okay, I'll relay your request to him.]]></string>
<string id="507282"><![CDATA[Fine. So the three of us are leaving.]]></string>
<string id="507283"><![CDATA[No, Eva, no one leaves the town. We need to quarantine the place.]]></string>
<string id="507284"><![CDATA[An odongh? Who is that?]]></string>
<string id="507285"><![CDATA[An "odongh" means "he who holds Him by the horns". That's what the people that bring in bulls from the Steppe are called.]]></string>
<string id="507286"><![CDATA[Can we bargain with the driver?]]></string>
<string id="507287"><![CDATA[Okay, I'll ask Maria.]]></string>
<string id="507288"><![CDATA[Why? Or is she... Ah, no, okay... Do you have any real proof of the forthcoming outbreak?]]></string>
<string id="507289"><![CDATA[I do.]]></string>
<string id="507290"><![CDATA[There is no other way... Talk to Maria! She's Nina's heir. The twins won't listen to anyone else but her. Peter is so unpredictable... But Maria knows how to clench his heart. One word from her would be enough for Peter to change his mind.]]></string>
<string id="507291"><![CDATA[I'll try.]]></string>
<string id="507292"><![CDATA[Only master Rubin's account.]]></string>

<string id="507299"><![CDATA[I will help you if your hand shakes.]]></string>
<string id="507300"><![CDATA[The boss turned out to be a cunt—the Big guy, that is. There's plague all 'round, and there he is, giving absolutely zero shits about the people. He probably knew about it all along and didn't say a thing.]]></string>
<string id="507301"><![CDATA[...What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="507302"><![CDATA[He'd hang himself before stopping the pump. He'd have us all dead 'n hangin'—just so that fat gets sucked from the ground and blood gets sucked from the people. Why is the Termitary all corked up? Why did they stop them factories today? Eh, those worker bees won't ever say "boo" to a goose, they won't...]]></string>
<string id="507303"><![CDATA[So you're a civil activist now, worrying about the plight of the working people? Weren't it your workers that were cutting the real workers' wives at every dark corner yesterday?]]></string>
<string id="507304"><![CDATA[You take me for a cunt, doc? We don't take kindly to murderers 'round here, we don't!

<string id="507308"><![CDATA[There's a thousand of herrings packed there, and another thousand on top of that, three thousands more in between and half a thousand by the side. All them workin' bees livin' cooped up together like worms in a dead body. No one's been comin' out of there for three days. So what's the tale, I'm askin', eh? "An order came through," they say, "sabotage suspected..." And then you cracked the plague riddle yesterday, so I got myself an epiphany...]]></string>
<string id="507309"><![CDATA[You think Vlad quarantined the Termitary?]]></string>
<string id="507310"><![CDATA[Wouldn't want to let mara the maneater in, now would he? So he probably knew about it all along... Probably wanted Simon to get lost already, lost in the netherworld. 'N all he had to do was just sit tight, y'know, sit tight 'n do nothin'. Whaddyathink?]]></string>
<string id="507311"><![CDATA[There is some food for thought there...]]></string>
<string id="507312"><![CDATA[You are slandering Olgimsky, that's what I think.]]></string>

<string id="507319"><![CDATA[I have business to discuss with you.]]></string>
<string id="507320"><![CDATA[Well, we're all businesspeople here! Speak up, mate.]]></string>
<string id="507328"><![CDATA[I need a weapon, Grief.]]></string>
<string id="507329"><![CDATA[Everybody needs a weapon. Gotta million? We'd even get you somethin' that shoots for a million. There ought to be a gun somewhere around, eh? Just one, pretty please? But everythin' has its price.]]></string>
<string id="507330"><![CDATA[A million? That price tag befits an artillery mortar, mate.]]></string>
<string id="507331"><![CDATA[Oh no, my lovely man, the mortar is a gift, it is. You can't go shootin' them robbers in a dark alley with a mortar. A barker, on the other hand… But it would probably cost you even more dearly, dear doc…]]></string>
<string id="507332"><![CDATA[Andrey is off to the kennel, Grief.]]></string>
<string id="507335"><![CDATA[Grief, what's going on in the Termitary?]]></string>
<string id="507336"><![CDATA[Quite the contrary, doc, quite the contrary. I'd buy them drugs for sure, just bring me some... See how everything's goin' around here—and you want to rob us of pills? You do not have my consent to that. They'll save us from the fever.]]></string>
<string id="507337"><![CDATA[What, you mean you'd buy any pills?]]></string>
<string id="507338"><![CDATA[Well, no, I'm not an idiot, mate. The sovereign ones. Words get 'round, y'know; everyone knows what works and what doesn't. I'm warnin' you, the demand for those is huge like a bull. If you need ammo though, I could see to that no problem. Nothing's too good for my dear man.]]></string>

<string id="507350"><![CDATA[I'm a doctor. Let me examine you.]]></string>
<string id="507351"><![CDATA[Don't come close. We are dying already. I told my sisters not to go outside... So they're… shambling… around the house…]]></string>
<string id="507352"><![CDATA[All right. Hold on, I'll get help.]]></string>
<string id="507353"><![CDATA[I'll be back.]]></string>
<string id="507354"><![CDATA[Take the key. You'll be able to open the door if we lose consciousness…]]></string>

<string id="507356"><![CDATA[Lie still!]]></string>
<string id="507357"><![CDATA[Who's shambling around the house? And why?]]></string>
<string id="507358"><![CDATA[Make them stop following me then! Why are they constantly at my heels? They are supposed to be lying down!]]></string>
<string id="507359"><![CDATA[You amaze me, Bachelor. Did you not make fun of the shabnak rumours yesterday? Mind you, there was some factual basis for all the hearsay. A lot of people don't have the faintest idea of what kinds of life may be found deep in the Steppe. They don't even know what kind of people live there; what kind of food they eat; what kind of effigies they make out of clay... Neither do you, to be fair. Still, you don't hesitate a moment to accept a rumour of an epidemic as veritable truth. Is the concept of the disease that much more familiar to you than that of a maneating abomination made of clay?]]></string>
<string id="507360"><![CDATA[It's simply because my head is screwed on right, dammit. Do you trust Rubin's opinion?]]></string>
<string id="507361"><![CDATA[This is most surprising. I haven't seen him since we last spoke, even though he said he would come. Why would he go into hiding? And where did he take the body he was examining? After all, why would he be so intent on avoiding any contact with you? ]]></string>
<string id="507362"><![CDATA[Okay, now I'm confused.]]></string>
<string id="507363"><![CDATA[...Let us get back to more pressing matters then. Here, take the money. I am not so eager to give everything I have to alleviate the outbreak, because I've yet to see any proof that the outbreak is real. But I am well aware of the reality of Lara's drastic circumstances. I will embrace the opportunity, however slim. Hopefully, at least part of the money will be used for purposes other than this shelter she has conceived of.]]></string>
<string id="507364"><![CDATA[This is exactly the kind of blindness that kills people during emergencies. Thank you for the donation.]]></string>
<string id="507365"><![CDATA[There have been quite a few deaths recently.]]></string>
<string id="507366"><![CDATA[That is terrible. All these years I was unable to fathom how porous the boundary between the bestial and the humane is. Porous if not altogether ethereal.]]></string>
<string id="507367"><![CDATA[Indeed it is.]]></string>
<string id="507368"><![CDATA[Mankind is the apex of creation because we are free. Animals don't even have an option.]]></string>
<string id="507369"><![CDATA[This is debatable.]]></string>
<string id="507370"><![CDATA[Yet now is not the time to get into this argument.]]></string>
<string id="507371"><![CDATA[Thank you, Yulia.]]></string>
<string id="507372"><![CDATA[No. All I did was sensibly evaluate the probability of both versions.]]></string>
<string id="507373"><![CDATA[Victoria, I need your help.]]></string>
<string id="507374"><![CDATA[I was actually about to share this with you! Little kids come to me in flocks from throughout the town. They are all scared. The youngest are afraid of shabnak. The older ones tell me that there is something wrong with certain houses. And who knows what's inside?]]></string>
<string id="507376"><![CDATA[I'll go see her if I have the time.]]></string>
<string id="507377"><![CDATA[...What will become of us?]]></string>
<string id="507378"><![CDATA[...I can't believe my ears. Someone has admitted that I am right.]]></string>
<string id="507379"><![CDATA[We need to buy emergency rations. A lot of them. It will be a challenge even today—but I fear that tomorrow it will simply become unfeasible.]]></string>
<string id="507380"><![CDATA[How much do you need?]]></string>
<string id="507381"><![CDATA[We need a lot. I want at least twelve people to be able to survive for a month in the house that will become a shelter. With minimal expenses, of course. My friends and those who help me set the place up will be accepted in.]]></string>
<string id="507382"><![CDATA[And what did you do to make that happen?]]></string>
<string id="507383"><![CDATA[I've collected all the money I could find. I've sent couriers on a shopping mission—trying to find the best prices. Now I need to collect the most important donations, from the Kains and the Olgimskys. Yulia agreed to make a donation too. I'm going to see them now, and then I'll join this crazy shop rush...]]></string>
<string id="507384"><![CDATA[Yes, it's absolutely absurd. I think the prices have gone up threefold.]]></string>
<string id="507386"><![CDATA[Can I become one of these people?]]></string>
<string id="507387"><![CDATA[Of course.]]></string>
<string id="507388"><![CDATA[What do I need to do?]]></string>
<string id="507389"><![CDATA[I do. But I'm used to doing everything myself, and I don't really have a choice right now.]]></string>
<string id="507390"><![CDATA[I will make the purchases. I have to do a lot of walking today anyway. Tell me what you need.]]></string>
<string id="507391"><![CDATA[Still, you shouldn't risk your life unnecessarily—better rely on your couriers.]]></string>
<string id="507392"><![CDATA[Where can I find the best prices at the moment?]]></string>
<string id="507393"><![CDATA[I've heard some shops are planning to sell stuff for bargain prices from time to time. Ask the townsfolk, they should know.]]></string>
<string id="507394"><![CDATA[This work is neither very time-consuming nor mundane. And it's definitely more than a mere errand. It's a very important mission.]]></string>
<string id="507395"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="507396"><![CDATA[Thank you. I'll come by to see you soon.]]></string>
<string id="507397"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="507398"><![CDATA[You need to bring it over to the empty house in the Flank. I showed you the way before, remember? My friends and an intendant that had helped us with the shopping are waiting there already.]]></string>
<string id="507399"><![CDATA[I'll be back soon.]]></string>
<string id="507400"><![CDATA[Your stare is no velvet either.]]></string>
<string id="507401"><![CDATA[Then why do you believe me?]]></string>
<string id="507402"><![CDATA[Me? I'm just not questioning anything. I'm not allowed to. If you want to know why I decided to give Lara my savings, I'll tell you this: that is because I'm compelled to. By the way, have you found the proof you were looking for?]]></string>
<string id="507403"><![CDATA[I'd rather you never did, en-Daniil…]]></string>
<string id="507404"><![CDATA[Too good to come true.]]></string>
<string id="507405"><![CDATA[I was planning to speak to your father in any case.]]></string>
<string id="507406"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="507407"><![CDATA[What's wrong with them leaving?]]></string>
<string id="507408"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="507409"><![CDATA[There can be many reasons...]]></string>
<string id="507410"><![CDATA[His way of thinking is provocation enough. What else do people hate each other for?]]></string>
<string id="507411"><![CDATA[For the structure on the other side of the river.]]></string>
<string id="507412"><![CDATA[People never hate geniuses more passionately than they crave them. Some would kill Peter. The rest are probably quietly suffering seeing him sink his talent in twyre vodka.]]></string>
<string id="507413"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="507414"><![CDATA[Why did you ask about Peter?]]></string>
<string id="507415"><![CDATA[Curious... You know, this gave me an interesting idea—because the last thing I want is for him to die.]]></string>
<string id="507416"><![CDATA[Don't even think about it! If they try to leave secretly, they will regret it. Andrey will be the first to. The great architects who once chose this town as their creative laboratory will not leave it at a time like this. Tell them both that if they do not wish to drink the cup of Nina Kaina's daughter's wrath, they will sit quietly at home! Both of them.]]></string>
<string id="507417"><![CDATA[I thought they were free people and had the right to do as they please.]]></string>
<string id="507418"><![CDATA[Whoa...]]></string>
<string id="507419"><![CDATA[Indeed… And Lara is a generous and selfless girl with a tragic fate... I will support her, of course. I'll send her some money tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="507420"><![CDATA[Was he executed? I thought he had died in battle.]]></string>
<string id="507421"><![CDATA[After the Battle of the Fords he was executed by firing squad along with other deserters. I still can't believe it. Captain Ravel has always been a man of rare courage. He enlisted in the Fourth Army as a volunteer. He was a staunch—one might even say fanatical—supporter of general Block. It's a strange story.]]></string>
<string id="507422"><![CDATA[I have come here at her behest. I'm afraid that every minute counts in a situation we've found ourselves in. The shops are running out of food as we speak. We must urgently buy the little that's left. Prices are growing rapidly.]]></string>
<string id="507423"><![CDATA[Fine.]]></string>
<string id="507424"><![CDATA[I see. Right now I can only give you some of the little we have left. Our family's funds are exhausted. I regret it, but that is directly related to my brother Simon's examination and burial.]]></string>
<string id="507425"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="507426"><![CDATA[I didn't know that.]]></string>
<string id="507427"><![CDATA[Lara doesn't know that either. She's been told that her father died as a hero at the Karstov Fords. And you know what? Somehow I've got the feeling that that's exactly what happened…]]></string>
<string id="507428"><![CDATA[I won't tell her anything, of course.]]></string>

<string id="507432"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="507433"><![CDATA[I have news for you. This evening Alexander Saburov will become the governor. Olgimsky and Kain are going to vest him nearly unrestricted powers to curb the epidemic that your brother and you refuse to believe in.]]></string>
<string id="507435"><![CDATA[I am.]]></string>
<string id="507436"><![CDATA[What of Georgiy? What does the Judge say? Bloody hell... So Saburov will be the judge now too?]]></string>
<string id="507437"><![CDATA[Definitely.]]></string>
<string id="507438"><![CDATA[That's it, I'm a dead man. As luck would have it…  it happens exactly when I'm about to create a truly glorious masterpiece... Fine. Let us go.]]></string>
<string id="507439"><![CDATA[So I'm telling Andrey you've agreed.]]></string>
<string id="507440"><![CDATA[How can anyone be sure of anything these days?]]></string>
<string id="507441"><![CDATA[I don't think so; but he'll have the right to execute anyone whom he considers to be guilty of breaking the quarantine.]]></string>
<string id="507442"><![CDATA[But why?]]></string>
<string id="507443"><![CDATA[Can't you see what I've managed to build here? Where else would I be allowed to do something like this?

I'm this close to figuring it out...]]></string>

<string id="507445"><![CDATA[...You wouldn't understand. You've never built anything.]]></string>

<string id="507646"><![CDATA[I would suspect foul play, but Burakh is known to disappear in such a manner. Sometimes he's gone for several days, sometimes for several weeks. Rumour has it that he explores the Steppe — going as far as the herdsmen's landings by the Eghe-Gola rise.]]></string>
<string id="507647"><![CDATA[I would still like to take a look at your brother. I made a long journey for this.]]></string>
<string id="507648"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="507649"><![CDATA[I personally asked him to come no later than midnight. Don't let it worry you.]]></string>
<string id="507650"><![CDATA[Hmm, it seems you are not in too much of a hurry to ascertain the details of your brother's death...]]></string>
<string id="507658"><![CDATA[No matter what happens, the truth will be revealed in the end.]]></string>
<string id="507744"><![CDATA[No need to be so scared.]]></string>
<string id="507745"><![CDATA[Fine, I'll help you. I've managed to find the time.]]></string>
<string id="507746"><![CDATA[We'll simply have to get by.]]></string>
<string id="507747"><![CDATA[Nothing good, believe me.]]></string>
<string id="507752"><![CDATA[Nevermind. This is enough.]]></string>
<string id="507753"><![CDATA[Really? Why?]]></string>
<string id="507754"><![CDATA[He has his own opinion on the matter. I think he accepts that you might be right—he accepts it, but he won't admit it. See the difference? Obviously, getting solid proof is disadvantageous to him for some reason. Not to mention that it would immediately cause him expenses...]]></string>
<string id="507777"><![CDATA[Oh... judging by how your family's acting, you can't.]]></string>
<string id="507778"><![CDATA[Simon Kain, the man of improper longevity, is waiting for me here. I hope he sympathizes with my request. I only need a living evidence of the impossible… ]]></string>
<string id="508097"><![CDATA[We, the Kains, have always been out of touch with mundane reality, but we are driven by love. Love can be furious, funny, and blind, but there's never a need to make excuses for it, is there?]]></string>
<string id="508111"><![CDATA[So Georgiy is your uncle? Somehow he looks like a grandfather to you.]]></string>
<string id="508125"><![CDATA[My uncle is a Judge. He was a Judge and he will remain that. People come to him rather than Saburov to settle disputes.]]></string>
<string id="508411"><![CDATA[So you have agreed to help us?]]></string>
<string id="508412"><![CDATA[Could he have been poisoned?]]></string>
<string id="508413"><![CDATA[No. He hadn't eaten or drunk anything for several days. And prior to that, he'd only drunk wine from the old household stock. He would open the bottles himself.]]></string>
<string id="508414"><![CDATA[What made him take such precautions?]]></string>
<string id="508415"><![CDATA[...I've never really thought about it. Indeed... But were they precautions at all? He was always conducting experiments on himself. Not only on his body, but on his time, his language, his way of thinking... Even his fate.]]></string>
<string id="508416"><![CDATA[Could his death have been the outcome of one of such experiments?]]></string>
<string id="508417"><![CDATA[I think, between me and you, that this is precisely what my brother Georgiy fears. I can say nothing more about that.]]></string>
<string id="508418"><![CDATA[So this could have been suicide?]]></string>
<string id="508419"><![CDATA[I don't think so. It's nearly an impossibility... But I don't have the right to tell you anything! My brother doesn't want us Kains to affect your line of thinking by giving you our interpretation of the facts.]]></string>
<string id="508420"><![CDATA[Could the murderer have already been waiting for Simon there?]]></string>
<string id="508421"><![CDATA[No. You have no concept of what the Focus is. Entering it is like entering someone else's mind, or a drawn picture if you will. It's impossible.]]></string>
<string id="508422"><![CDATA[What's this Focus place?]]></string>
<string id="508428"><![CDATA[It's hard to explain... It's his study, if you will. An extraordinarily spacious creative laboratory. Almost perfectly sealed off—except for the door that was visible at all times. Metaphorically speaking.]]></string>
<string id="508429"><![CDATA[I don't understand.]]></string>
<string id="508430"><![CDATA[Well, Simon did somehow, didn't he?]]></string>
<string id="508431"><![CDATA[He could perform far more impressive feats. There's a reason why the whole town reveres… I mean, revered him.]]></string>
<string id="508432"><![CDATA[Tell me honestly, dear Victor... Did Simon exist at all?]]></string>
<string id="508433"><![CDATA[Bravo, doctor! There is indeed a spark of genius to you. Alas… yes. Yes, he did.]]></string>
<string id="508434"><![CDATA["Alas"?]]></string>
<string id="508435"><![CDATA[It's not that I would benefit from his death. Alas—for that would be too simple an explanation. Simon well and truly did exist. That is exactly what's left everyone in disarray; it was so hard for them to accept his existence that the thought of his demise is now driving them mad.]]></string>
<string id="508436"><![CDATA[Fair enough. What do you want from me, then?]]></string>
<string id="508437"><![CDATA[You're not going to believe it. For my creations! The Downgate, the Alley of Heroes ensemble, The Other Stairway Round. The House House was specifically renounced by the World Association of Architects. Even though it's always been my little brother and me... I am usually the one to take the beating.]]></string>
<string id="508438"><![CDATA[Really? I didn't even know all those things were your works. It's an honour to meet you!]]></string>
<string id="508439"><![CDATA[Can she really predict the future?]]></string>
<string id="508440"><![CDATA[She sees... the vague features... and she always speaks the truth, just like a true Mistress ought to.]]></string>
<string id="508441"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="508442"><![CDATA[I can hardly believe that.]]></string>
<string id="508443"><![CDATA[My name is Daniil. Daniil Dankovsky.]]></string>
<string id="508444"><![CDATA[Well, yes. I'm the mistress of this house, after all. That doesn't mean I'm a Mistress, mind you, not with a capital "M"… I won't ever become one. But I can also serve people to the best of my ability.]]></string>
<string id="508445"><![CDATA[Nice to meet a person of a sceptical mind. I am Vladislav Olgimsky. The younger one, of course. And you are, of course, Daniil Dankovsky.]]></string>
<string id="508446"><![CDATA[Yes, that is me.]]></string>
<string id="508447"><![CDATA[Nice to meet you.]]></string>
<string id="508448"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="508449"><![CDATA[May I ask why?]]></string>
<string id="508451"><![CDATA[The killer's goals seem to align astonishingly well with the goals of those who've been waging war against my work for years.]]></string>
<string id="508452"><![CDATA[We share a tragedy. I want to exact vengeance upon the one that robbed me and my work of a future.]]></string>
<string id="508453"><![CDATA[I want to solve a puzzle. I even like having so little information. It's a challenge to my intellect.]]></string>
<string id="508454"><![CDATA[I'm prepared to answer any questions you may have.]]></string>
<string id="508456"><![CDATA[Why not?]]></string>
<string id="508457"><![CDATA[It will benefit us too much if Simon's death is interpreted in… a certain fashion. And damage us too much if it's interpreted in a certain other fashion. I will not elaborate on that.]]></string>
<string id="508460"><![CDATA[It's like an equation. Or a mirror puzzle. Anyway, the murderer could not have been hiding there. Take my word for it.]]></string>
<string id="508463"><![CDATA[I'm still thinking it over.]]></string>
<string id="508464"><![CDATA[In that case I don't have the right to reveal the details. If you change your mind... I will be prepared to answer any questions. And please inform Georgiy if you do… He is putting too much hope in you.]]></string>
<string id="508465"><![CDATA[I know.]]></string>
<string id="508628"><![CDATA[The mysterious Maria, Victor Kain's daughter, has been expecting my arrival for several days. She seems to know more about me than I do.]]></string>
<string id="508629"><![CDATA[This is where Victor lives, the youngest of the three Kain brothers. He can tell me more about Simon's manner of death.]]></string>
<string id="508630"><![CDATA[This mansion, called the Stillwater, belongs to a single girl called Eva Yan. An accidental midnight encounter provided me with a lovely companion and temporary lodging.]]></string>
<string id="508631"><![CDATA[Simon is dead. His brother Georgiy is preparing to take the empty throne of the clan's leader. The Kains are obsessed with the idea of finding the murderer. They don't seem to be driven by rancour, but rather by the desire to uncover a mystery…]]></string>
<string id="508632"><![CDATA[The Rod. The Saburovs have been living here since the town was founded. Once a mighty and powerful clan, it only has two persons now: a governor devoid of any real authority and his dying wife.]]></string>
<string id="508633"><![CDATA[This is the Lump, the mansion belonging to the Olgimskys—a family of factory owners. The fifty-year-old Vladislav, its housefather, is called Vlad the Heavy by the locals for his bad temper.]]></string>
<string id="508634"><![CDATA[The Willows serves as the residence for a singer called Anna—her last name, Angel, has a curious ring to it. Yulia believes that the suspected murderer may be hiding here.]]></string>
<string id="508635"><![CDATA[Getting rid of the bodies is an emotional and troublesome business. Grace, a young girl and the muse of the cemetery, can help Anna Angel arrange that.]]></string>
<string id="508636"><![CDATA[The intelligent Yulia lives here. She may be my only ally in my attempt to put the fairy-tales of this backwards place to the test of algebra and physics…]]></string>
<string id="508637"><![CDATA[This is where Isidor Burakh lives, the man that had brought me to this remote place. He is the last person that saw Simon Kain alive.]]></string>
<string id="508638"><![CDATA[Hoping to find Eva, Andrey went to the marsh, to check with the Worms.]]></string>
<string id="508639"><![CDATA[My new friend turned out to be both well-known and well-informed. Yulia insists I consult her when I meet a dead end.]]></string>
<string id="508640"><![CDATA[The owner of this house, Katerina Saburova, has something crucial to tell me.]]></string>
<string id="508641"><![CDATA[A runaway burcher, that according to the rumours is likely to be the maneater, has found shelter here. I should interrogate the suspect before the eccentric Kains get to him.]]></string>
<string id="508642"><![CDATA[Vlad the Younger is more than eager to get rid of some beastlike troublemaker. I wonder what the creature whose murder would not be considered a crime looks like?]]></string>
<string id="508643"><![CDATA[Worms, the twyre gatherers, are likely to know who Burakh had sold his concoctions to… ]]></string>
<string id="508644"><![CDATA[Worms, the twyre gatherers, are likely to know who Burakh had sold his concoctions to… ]]></string>
<string id="508645"><![CDATA[Anna Angel keeps a considerable amount of medical supplies. I should talk her into donating part of the stock to public needs.]]></string>
<string id="508646"><![CDATA[Lara Ravel lives here. According to Yulia Lyuricheva, a decent amount of local social events revolve around the girl. Her connections may prove to be invaluable.]]></string>
<string id="508647"><![CDATA[Why would anyone choose such a remote shack as their regular place of residence? Vlad the Younger is in no hurry to return home—and I strongly doubt his actions are motivated purely by the desire to live independently of his fierce father…]]></string>
<string id="508648"><![CDATA[The hooks to Aspity's heart are at Vlad the Younger's.]]></string>
<string id="508649"><![CDATA[Time to have a closer look at the monstrous Aspity. Now I know how to hook her good conscience…]]></string>
<string id="508689"><![CDATA[So the merchant's son prefers a disheveled shack by the railroad to his father's manor. A rather peculiar choice…]]></string>
<string id="508690"><![CDATA[Okay, so I will help you. Too many women were killed today based on these absurd suspicions.]]></string>
<string id="508691"><![CDATA[So you do believe that I'm not to blame for this man's death?]]></string>
<string id="508692"><![CDATA[If anyone finds out there's a dead man in your house, it would do you no good.]]></string>
<string id="508736"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="508737"><![CDATA[Dear colleague! By some happy coincidence I managed to get my hands on a certain... vessel, that I believe I can recover the pathogen from. Which means we are now all set to research the vaccine! But, odd as it may sound, I'd rather avoid tapping into that... source I mentioned, unless I absolutely have to. I'd rather examine the samples that can be procured from the dead tissue.]]></string>
<string id="508739"><![CDATA[That's impossible...]]></string>
<string id="508740"><![CDATA[You will soon get used to how many things in this town would commonly be described as impossible. This is not what matters, anyway. We were unable to nip the outbreak in the bud, but if the disease we're looking at is indeed the Sand Plague—we will be able to fight it.]]></string>
<string id="508746"><![CDATA[You seem to have a solution already.]]></string>
<string id="508747"><![CDATA[...We can try to cure Simon. If we cure him, we cure the town. I do not make much difference between the town and Simon, and neither does anyone here. Next point: to get this chimera of a sickness out of his chimera of a body, we need to research it first. Are we on the same page?]]></string>
<string id="508748"><![CDATA[To isolate a chimera is to do the impossible. Especially in these conditions.]]></string>
<string id="508749"><![CDATA[Precisely, colleague. You took the words out of my mouth. It's almost impossible, but still worth a try! After all, Master succeded in doing just that. I'll try to extract the microbial culture from the tissue by means of traditional chemistry. All I need from you is to help me get enough samples of dead tissue.]]></string>
<string id="508751"><![CDATA[I was going to ask you to bring a sample or two from one of the infected quarters. Be doubly careful though, and make sure to get the dissection fully cleared with one of the rulers, else the risk would be twice as high as needs be. I'd go myself, but there are reasons that make it impossible for me to leave Simon's body unattended.]]></string>
<string id="508752"><![CDATA[That's some request... What is this additional danger you speak of?]]></string>
<string id="508753"><![CDATA[Do pay a visit to governor Saburov. I wouldn't go to Vlad if I were you, he's too resourceful, and too inclined to drag you into his schemes... The Kains are also out of the question as anything that leads Georgiy to me would likely result in Simon's body being removed. And I still have a lot of work to do.]]></string>
<string id="508754"><![CDATA[Sounds reasonable. I'll see you soon.]]></string>
<string id="508757"><![CDATA[That's not so difficult, as it is, but to take samples I need syringes, sterile containers, ice packs... I see none of those here.]]></string>
<string id="508758"><![CDATA[As they searched for Isidor's killer, these savages wrought havok on what laboratory equipment we had. And, after the rumours of your discovery reached the townsfolk, most medicants and reagents were stolen. Regrettably, I was unable to control it.]]></string>
<string id="508759"><![CDATA[You do understand that this makes further work impossible, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="508760"><![CDATA[We need to investigate the matter, apprehend the looters, and recover the medicine! This is a small town, the scoundrels should be easy enough to find.]]></string>
<string id="508761"><![CDATA[Ugh… I need some time to think it over. Dissecting corpses befits medical students, and I'm no longer one of those.]]></string>
<string id="508762"><![CDATA[You are still not entirely honest with me! You are not really going to cure him, are you?]]></string>
<string id="508763"><![CDATA[We don't have anything to enable this kind of procedure. All we have here is this... "equipment"... of yours, so to speak.]]></string>
<string id="508764"><![CDATA[Simon Kain, the immortal man... the keeper of the town... Huh.]]></string>
<string id="508765"><![CDATA[I'm sure Georgiy will be very happy to hear that. What do you think?]]></string>
<string id="508766"><![CDATA[I wouldn't hurry to let him know, doctor. Georgiy is an artisan, but not a sage. His anger cannot be contained. If he learns that his brother is alive, he will never allow us to complete what we've started. He will take the body from us and we won't be able to further our studies. Our research will be jeopardised.]]></string>
<string id="508767"><![CDATA[Are you going to research this... phenomenon? Or were you talking about the disease?]]></string>
<string id="508768"><![CDATA[I'm a bachelor. I'm not a doctor. The way things are looking, I won't ever become one.]]></string>
<string id="508769"><![CDATA[What kind of relationship you have with the Kains, colleague?]]></string>
<string id="508770"><![CDATA[Friendly, I would say.]]></string>
<string id="508771"><![CDATA[I'd say our relationship is rather tense.]]></string>
<string id="508772"><![CDATA[Is that so? They don't seem to know anything about it. Both Georgiy and Victor speak of you with sympathy and respect. I was told they treat you like a friend; a brother; a son... Some people go as far as to say they will make you heir to their family!]]></string>
<string id="508773"><![CDATA[I will rectify this mistake in due time. What was it you were going to tell me?]]></string>
<string id="508774"><![CDATA[I need to confide in you, then, if you agree to listen to my somewhat harrowing confession. I urge you to hear me out; the fate of the town depends on it, as does our possible victory over the disease.]]></string>
<string id="508775"><![CDATA[Go ahead.]]></string>
<string id="508776"><![CDATA[The body of Simon is the source from where I get the bacteria. The pathogen survives within him because... because Simon is still alive. He is lethargic.. or something to that effect. His body carries all visible signs of the Sand Pest, even his skin has discoloured. But he isn't dead.]]></string>
<string id="508777"><![CDATA[Wait a moment... How can we possibly produce a vaccine with what scarce equipment we have?]]></string>
<string id="508778"><![CDATA[Unfortunately, there are only twenty four hours in a day... We don't have much time.]]></string>
<string id="508779"><![CDATA[The infected quarter is hell on earth. It's absolutely impossible to survive there. Do you have any antibiotics at all? Any kind of immune system stimulants?]]></string>
<string id="508780"><![CDATA[You are still not being entirely sincere with me, colleague. Tell me about Simon.]]></string>
<string id="508781"><![CDATA[Where is Simon, colleague?]]></string>
<string id="508782"><![CDATA[I keep him at an ice cellar, not far from here.]]></string>
<string id="508783"><![CDATA[Why don't you give the body back to the Kains?]]></string>
<string id="508784"><![CDATA[Because I'm not done with it yet! Besides, I am all alone here. The moment I had an opportunity to send a message outside, I used it to bring you here. Your presence is more important than other considerations right now. Would you kindly hear what my request is?]]></string>
<string id="508785"><![CDATA[What do you want to ask of me?]]></string>
<string id="508786"><![CDATA[It won't be a vaccine per se, but rather a solution that might temporarily bolster the immune system. True, I don't have much in the way of equipment, but I have plenty of reagents, herbal tinctures... twyrine infusions, by and large. The least we can expect is to keep ourselves reasonably safe until a better equipped team arrives.]]></string>
<string id="508787"><![CDATA[Where are we going to get the dead tissue from?]]></string>
<string id="508790"><![CDATA[Find someone else to obtain the samples! Our job is to study the specimen under the microscope, not to cut it out in some seedy alley!]]></string>
<string id="508791"><![CDATA[Believe me, I tried my best. No one wants anything to do with the mutilation of dead bodies. Isidor's students have gone into hiding. I planned to approach the butchers, but Olgimsky has blocked off the Termitary. I would search for a stray butcher in town, there may be some, but I can't leave Simon's body. There is no one who would do it for us right now.]]></string>
<string id="508792"><![CDATA[Very well. I got agitated beyond reason. I'll bring you the sample.]]></string>
<string id="508793"><![CDATA[I will keep working until we are able to isolate the microbe. I don't understand why we can't see the culture yet? There are traces aplenty, but not the bacteria themselves.]]></string>
<string id="508794"><![CDATA[Let us keep searching.]]></string>
<string id="508795"><![CDATA[Shall we perhaps invite an infected person right here?]]></string>
<string id="508796"><![CDATA[Out of the question. Without anything to protect ourselves, we will surely die. In fact, developing these means of protection is precisely the purpose of our unpleasant and criminal work.]]></string>
<string id="508797"><![CDATA[You're right... There must be some other option.]]></string>
<string id="508798"><![CDATA[I heard a rumour of a man who is well-equipped to both dissect the dead and gut the living. In fact, he's the son of the deceased healer, your Master. Did you get to meet him?]]></string>
<string id="508799"><![CDATA[I didn't. A few of my friends are trying to find him on my behalf, with no success yet.]]></string>
<string id="508800"><![CDATA[That's unfortunate. I will try to think of some other option. See you soon, colleague.]]></string>
<string id="508801"><![CDATA[I'm sure that whenever they find him, he will prove to be very helpful indeed. This is, after all, his line of occupation. He's bound to do a better job than I ever could. As for me, I've had enough of that already.]]></string>
<string id="508802"><![CDATA[Perhaps we should switch places?]]></string>
<string id="508803"><![CDATA[Would you be able to apply herbal tinctures to the specimen? To prepare the reagents; to adjust their potency? Working with herbs requires knowledge and experience—and we have nothing but herbs to work with. Besides, the Kains hold me personally responsible for my precious patient.]]></string>
<string id="508804"><![CDATA[Very well. How many samples do you need?]]></string>
<string id="508808"><![CDATA[Dissection of dead bodies is something that the locals strongly disapprove of. For Steppe people, the human body represents the world. Only a member of a special taglur—Burakh, to name one—is allowed to "open it up". This is a caste-based privilege, you see.]]></string>
<string id="508809"><![CDATA[Does everyone in the town share this same prejudice?]]></string>
<string id="508810"><![CDATA[No, of course not. But even those who are oblivious of the sacred meaning of the Kin's rituals would still oppose unsanctioned dissection, because it's traditionally inappropriate. A cultural taboo, if you will. An autopsy performed by anyone other than a true born menkhu is seen as blasphemy of the worst kind. Even incest is not as repulsive to them.]]></string>
<string id="508811"><![CDATA[Which doesn't stop them from being comfortable with all manner of slaughter.]]></string>
<string id="508812"><![CDATA[These people are outlaws, and not a single one of them is a Steppe man.]]></string>
<string id="508813"><![CDATA[So what am I supposed to do?]]></string>
<string id="508814"><![CDATA[Ahem... I had no idea…]]></string>
<string id="508815"><![CDATA[I want to see what the disease can do to human internal organs. I need more time for that; I didn't even perform an autopsy yet.]]></string>
<string id="508816"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="508817"><![CDATA[And I thought you wanted to see if Simon has the same anatomy as a regular human being.]]></string>
<string id="508818"><![CDATA[Well… the initial diagnosis was supported. There is no doubt Simon died to Sand Plague.]]></string>
<string id="508819"><![CDATA[And yet you're still studying the body. Why?]]></string>
<string id="508820"><![CDATA[You see through me, Bachelor. This is, indeed, my purpose, and this is the reason why I cannot give back the body. I hope you won't tell the Kains where I am.]]></string>
<string id="508821"><![CDATA[I won't. I'd be interested to know what the autopsy will reveal.]]></string>
<string id="508822"><![CDATA[I doubt I will be able to lie if the Kains ask me directly.]]></string>
<string id="508823"><![CDATA[I urge you not to do it. Simon is the key to our salvation; we need to study him as much as possible. Don't throw the opportunity away.]]></string>
<string id="508824"><![CDATA[You demand that I enter an agreement with my own conscience, Rubin.]]></string>
<string id="508826"><![CDATA[I do. In circumstances such as these, we have to sacrifice everything for the common good.]]></string>
<string id="508827"><![CDATA[Very well. I won't tell them anything.]]></string>
<string id="508828"><![CDATA[I'll think about it.]]></string>
<string id="508829"><![CDATA[None whatsoever. I don't have any medicine here. Truth be told, this is one of the reasons I would prefer not to enter the infected quarter myself.]]></string>
<string id="508830"><![CDATA[Now, that's unfortunate...]]></string>
<string id="508831"><![CDATA[Rumour has it that the Olgimskys have organised the distribution of medicine among a few of the more important townspeople. I had to stay here in hiding, so I did not get any of that. But, some of the people you've come to know here will be only too happy to help.]]></string>
<string id="508832"><![CDATA[Good thinking. I'll follow your advice.]]></string>
<string id="508833"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="508835"><![CDATA[The disease is spreading quickly. The neighbouring district is almost entirely steeped in infection by now. And even though the Powers That Be have informed me that help is on the way, I doubt that they're aware of the rate of spread... But let's not lose hope. What are you working on now?]]></string>
<string id="508836"><![CDATA[I intend to start studying the pathologic culture now. Which is why I'd like to ask for your help.]]></string>
<string id="508837"><![CDATA[What kind of help can I offer you?]]></string>
<string id="508839"><![CDATA[Vlad Olgimsky is in charge of this matter. He has agreed to provide funds and manpower. Talk to him. ]]></string>
<string id="508840"><![CDATA[I need to work with dead bodies. I was told that this work demands your sanction. Is that true?]]></string>
<string id="508841"><![CDATA[I regret to say that no one can help you here. Local superstition prohibits any violation of a body's integrity. Add a cult of the dead on top... If they see you dissecting a corpse, they might tear you to pieces. It has already happened once.]]></string>
<string id="508842"><![CDATA[It's essential for my work. ]]></string>
<string id="508843"><![CDATA[I understand, but there's nothing I can do. Let us pretend this conversation never happened. You might want to turn to your new acquaintances. As far as I can judge, they are ready to do anything you ask.]]></string>
<string id="508844"><![CDATA[I'll do that then. I should hope the infected districts have already reconsidered this reactionary, prejudiced stance!]]></string>
<string id="508845"><![CDATA[I'd rather turn to someone educated.]]></string>
<string id="508846"><![CDATA[How was such a bizarre tradition born? ]]></string>
<string id="508847"><![CDATA[I am not the best expert on the Kin. Ask the residents of the Earth district, I'm sure they can tell you more. Although they are not particularly talkative… Ask Big Vlad. He has promised to assist you in every way... the cunning hypocrite!]]></string>
<string id="508848"><![CDATA[Very well. But I don't need dead tissues for my own entertainment; I need them in order to fight the disease!]]></string>
<string id="508849"><![CDATA[I need equipment. I've found out by chance that Isidor's laboratory was ransacked during the recent riots. I'd be grateful if you found the perpetrators and confiscated what they had looted.]]></string>
<string id="508850"><![CDATA[Yes, I've heard that. They're already being investigated. However, I would not call Burakh's dwelling a laboratory... It was more of a workshop. There weren't many valuables there. Still, I will let you know when the stolen items are recovered.]]></string>
<string id="508851"><![CDATA[Thank you. ]]></string>
<string id="508852"><![CDATA[This and that... I'm conducting certain observations. ]]></string>
<string id="508853"><![CDATA[That is my private business, ruler. ]]></string>
<string id="508854"><![CDATA[We are doing worse than ever. The infection is spreading!]]></string>
<string id="508855"><![CDATA[What makes you say that?]]></string>
<string id="508856"><![CDATA[Where will the hospital be set up? ]]></string>
<string id="508857"><![CDATA[What about burials? Who has assumed responsibility for burying the deceased?]]></string>
<string id="508858"><![CDATA[The volunteers don't see a danger there for now. The townspeople are coping on their own. Why does that interest you?]]></string>
<string id="508859"><![CDATA[I need tissue samples from someone who died of the Sand Fever.]]></string>
<string id="508860"><![CDATA[This difficulty could be resolved by some rather sinister people... I am talking about butchers. Butchers, rather obviously, have no qualms about cutting bodies. Tradition gives them a hereditary right to perform this sacred act. ]]></string>
<string id="508861"><![CDATA[What do you personally think about it? ]]></string>
<string id="508862"><![CDATA[I don't share the views of the Steppe people. As a former military man, I regard the taboo against dissecting bodies as mere prejudice. But I wouldn't like my reputation in the town to be that of a blasphemer. If someone finds out that I've given you permission to autopsy a corpse, I am doomed.]]></string>
<string id="508863"><![CDATA[Then what am I supposed to bloody do?]]></string>
<string id="508864"><![CDATA[I've yet to see a single butcher in this town.]]></string>
<string id="508865"><![CDATA[Of course. Olgimsky had them locked up after another of their strikes. However, it is said that on the eve of the blockade, a group of butchers did not make it back to the Termitary on time. Someone is hiding them... There is a house here in Earth whose dwellers know who it is. Take a chance.]]></string>
<string id="508866"><![CDATA[Thank you. Excellent advice. ]]></string>
<string id="508867"><![CDATA[Listen, governor. I don't intend to offend anyone's sensibilities. It's the common good that requires your tradition to be violated just this once.]]></string>
<string id="508868"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="508869"><![CDATA[Please touch me—do I have a fever?]]></string>
<string id="508870"><![CDATA[I know everything.]]></string>
<string id="508871"><![CDATA[So?]]></string>
<string id="508872"><![CDATA[The infection goes straight to the head. It talks to you a bit with this little inner voice, and then it moves in completely. For a while. The tenant is rather troublesome, and the body makes for a lousy lodging—it breaks apart all too easily. And so the disease leaves it and moves along to find someone else.]]></string>
<string id="508873"><![CDATA["Moves in"? What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="508874"><![CDATA[It listens to your thoughts, peeks inside you, takes a nice look, and moves in. But! The check-in only happens after a very short and crucial interview. It'll only move in if it fancies you, otherwise you may keep on with your plain boring life. But making it fancy you is easy, it doesn't really discriminate, as you can see.]]></string>
<string id="508875"><![CDATA[Did it speak to you too?]]></string>
<string id="508876"><![CDATA[I think it did, it's just that I was unlucky.]]></string>
<string id="508877"><![CDATA[My condolences.]]></string>
<string id="508878"><![CDATA[Thanks for the discussion. You're an engaging conversationalist.]]></string>
<string id="508879"><![CDATA[Very poetic. Very far from the truth.]]></string>
<string id="508880"><![CDATA[Poetry aside, sounds plausible.]]></string>
<string id="508881"><![CDATA[Who said anything about poetry? You're missing the point. It doesn't touch the next person as long as it's comfortable with the current one.]]></string>
<string id="508882"><![CDATA[You said it goes to the head. What did you mean?]]></string>
<string id="508883"><![CDATA[Who told you that?]]></string>
<string id="508884"><![CDATA[Internal relations, Bachelor. You wouldn't understand—I can visualize this crazy gallop. If you manage to distract it, make it shift its attention to others, you'll live. When the Sand Pest starts talking to you, pretend to be someone else, and you'll trick it.]]></string>
<string id="508885"><![CDATA[I'll keep this in mind.]]></string>
<string id="508886"><![CDATA[But that would be a rather mean trick, wouldn't it?]]></string>
<string id="508887"><![CDATA[Everything in the world?]]></string>
<string id="508888"><![CDATA[Do you know anything about how the disease is transmitted?]]></string>
<string id="508889"><![CDATA[You are concealing runaway butchers in this very house, Aspity.]]></string>
<string id="508890"><![CDATA[Well, crucify me! What's this about? Running more errands for the Olgimskys?]]></string>
<string id="508891"><![CDATA[No. This time I've come on my own accord. I need your help. ]]></string>
<string id="508892"><![CDATA[Well, I gotta hear that. Why on earth would the wise serpent seek anyone's help…?]]></string>
<string id="508893"><![CDATA[Indeed. They want the heads of everyone you're hiding.]]></string>
<string id="508894"><![CDATA[I need the tissue of a Sand Plague victim.]]></string>
<string id="508895"><![CDATA[You can only find dead victims in the infected houses. Since you appear to be alive, you have never entered a single one of them. You will have five to ten minutes if you do—then the infection strikes. With the expected results.]]></string>
<string id="508896"><![CDATA[Perhaps you could find a single runaway that would agree to help? What would he want in return?]]></string>
<string id="508897"><![CDATA[How about I make you all comply by force?]]></string>
<string id="508898"><![CDATA[Brute force won't help you in the slightest. They've got nothing to lose. I mean, sure, do bring the thugs, welcome! We'll meet you with proper respect and due ceremonies, as long as you manage to break the door. Now get lost—and never ever come back here as the Olgimskys' errand boy.]]></string>
<string id="508899"><![CDATA[Make ready for the ceremonies then.]]></string>
<string id="508900"><![CDATA[We'll see how it goes.]]></string>
<string id="508901"><![CDATA[Perhaps I could find a lot of runaways that would agree to help if only I ask them to. And the same me will ask you for a favour then. Will you do me one?]]></string>
<string id="508902"><![CDATA[It depends on what you're planning to ask.]]></string>
<string id="508903"><![CDATA[I will. Go ahead and speak.]]></string>
<string id="508904"><![CDATA[You're influential with Olgimsky. Use that influence. Tell him to stop persecuting the runaways. It's no longer a revenge situation—but he's still all too eager... Takes the guy quite some time to calm down, huh? Anyway. If he swears to leave alone the butchers that are now outside the Termitary, I'll talk three runaways into risking their lives. It's not like they have anything to lose anyway.]]></string>
<string id="508905"><![CDATA[I'll try. ]]></string>
<string id="508906"><![CDATA[No, that I won't do. I'll deal with the situation without you.]]></string>
<string id="508908"><![CDATA[Big Vlad agrees. He swore that from this point on not a single runaway in the town would be killed on his orders.]]></string>
<string id="508909"><![CDATA[Proof? ]]></string>
<string id="508910"><![CDATA[My word. And Vlad's word too, of course. Right now he's in no position to break his promise. He is also persecuted.]]></string>
<string id="508913"><![CDATA[It's already done. The orders have been issued for Saburov's patrolmen and the Olgimsky's men. Sealed and delivered.]]></string>
<string id="508914"><![CDATA[…Fine then. I'll send three butchers to the infected Skinners. They'll be waiting for you there—if they manage to find a dead body, cut it, and survive to see you, that is. Follow them in an hour. They may die before you reach them, so waste no time.]]></string>
<string id="508916"><![CDATA[Why do you want them to split?]]></string>
<string id="508917"><![CDATA[That enhances the chance of success, doesn't it? Also these three butchers I fancy the least.]]></string>
<string id="508918"><![CDATA[It would make sense for me to go with them straight away then, wouldn't it?]]></string>
<string id="508919"><![CDATA[Only the shabnak cut the dead open—and does it even matter whose hand holds the knife? What matters is who's given out the order. Or do you think people won't realize who's violating the dead if you simply keep quiet and stand to the side?]]></string>
<string id="508920"><![CDATA[Sounds convincing.]]></string>
<string id="508921"><![CDATA[I say... ]]></string>
<string id="508922"><![CDATA[I strongly advise you to conduct reconnaissance before you go to the infected district. Prepare for the field trip well… Rumour has it, the place leaves you less chances than a mincing machine would. The patrolmen guarding the infected houses have already consumed half the confiscated drugs.]]></string>
<string id="508923"><![CDATA[Thank you, Aspity.]]></string>
<string id="508924"><![CDATA[Don't you teach me how to do my job.]]></string>
<string id="508925"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="508926"><![CDATA[The Skinners... Yes... That was one nasty day, wouldn't you agree?]]></string>
<string id="508927"><![CDATA[We're already busy starting it. Do you want to know more? Is that the only reason why you came?]]></string>
<string id="508928"><![CDATA[Yes. Please tell me what measures you have taken. ]]></string>
<string id="508929"><![CDATA[Do you think we ought to report to you, my dear doctor? Although there's nothing to hide... Our town has no suitable buildings... Someone suggested we found a hospital in an abandoned house, but the conditions... ]]></string>
<string id="508930"><![CDATA[Who cares about the conditions? We need a hospital urgently. We need it right now. Where are the patients taken to? ]]></string>
<string id="508931"><![CDATA[To the cemetery, dear doctor. The mortality rate is absolute. You're supposed to know that better than anyone—including me. The dying need only water and morphine. Sometimes vodka too. They can depart to the better world painlessly then. ]]></string>
<string id="508932"><![CDATA[That doesn't release us from the obligation to build a hospital. Report to me as soon as the facility is equipped. ]]></string>
<string id="508933"><![CDATA[Does that mean that you've already established the supply of the substances required? Vodka, water, and morphine... I'm afraid that won't be enough.]]></string>
<string id="508934"><![CDATA[Be so kind as to do the following: Check every warehouse and every store that may still have medicine left. Confiscate everything you find. I'll check what we have in stock and choose the appropriate remedies.]]></string>
<string id="508935"><![CDATA[It's not a trivial task, doctor…]]></string>
<string id="508936"><![CDATA[Which is why I have to resort to you personal power... and the opportunities it provides.]]></string>
<string id="508937"><![CDATA[If it was easy, I would have done it myself. ]]></string>
<string id="508938"><![CDATA[What about the conditions? ]]></string>
<string id="508939"><![CDATA[It turned out to be very tricky to provide the patients with water. You may not have been told about it, but the water supply has been blocked and partially destroyed. Rumour has it that the water intake and even the river are already contaminated... Barrels are the only source of drinking water right now. ]]></string>
<string id="508940"><![CDATA[Where are the patients taken to?]]></string>
<string id="508941"><![CDATA[No. As far as I understand, you are the person that keeps the native population in check—and that is why I need you. Most of your workers are from the Steppe, aren't they? ]]></string>
<string id="508942"><![CDATA[Let me put it this way, I have a certain influence on them... Yet the only thing in charge of the Kin is the Kin itself... Keeping it in check is no easier than managing a community of... silkworms or termites. The Foreman of the Abattoir knows how to do it—to a certain extent... But why do you ask?]]></string>
<string id="508943"><![CDATA[I need to work with dead bodies. Since I still haven't been provided a place to keep my research uninterrupted, I need to find out a way to deal with this issue.]]></string>
<string id="508944"><![CDATA[The dead bodies are already being worked with. The person who's doing it will be eager to share the results with you. Look for him in the disease hotbeds—most likely he has already gone there.]]></string>
<string id="508945"><![CDATA[Thank you for the advice. ]]></string>
<string id="508946"><![CDATA[Who is it? And how do l recognize him? ]]></string>
<string id="508947"><![CDATA[He stands out from the crowd, my friend... You will know him at once. He is quiet—unlike the others... and has a Steppe phenotype. There's a deep wrinkle on his forehead. He'll wear protective garments... I bet they'll be stained... with blood. ]]></string>
<string id="508948"><![CDATA[Right, I guess it won't be too hard to find a person with such obvious features.]]></string>
<string id="508949"><![CDATA[I'm happy to relieve your mind, doctor. We're distributing protective and preventative drugs daily among the townsfolk. Even the antibiotics... We've selected the drug agents from the list you gave us yesterday. Are you satisfied?]]></string>
<string id="508950"><![CDATA[Quite. ]]></string>
<string id="508951"><![CDATA[Well. I am glad you've finally given me the credit I deserve. The Kains have also given out everything they had… though they had less than me... And it's easier to give out things when you're poor as a church mouse... ]]></string>
<string id="508952"><![CDATA[I am grateful to you, boös Vlad. ]]></string>
<string id="508953"><![CDATA[It's your duty. More than once have I heard you being called a ruler. The title implies certain obligations. ]]></string>
<string id="508954"><![CDATA[...You've given everything you had? ]]></string>
<string id="508955"><![CDATA[And it was still too little... We've estimated that help will arrive in five days. According to the last census, there are about ten thousand people in the town... All in all, they've got dribs and drabs... There is a strategic reserve, but if it takes five more days... no one would be able to help us then.]]></string>
<string id="508956"><![CDATA[Forgive me, boös Vlad. I thought worse of you than you deserved. ]]></string>
<string id="508957"><![CDATA[Who is in charge of the public trust? ]]></string>
<string id="508958"><![CDATA[Katerina. The last Mistress. But my daughter—and young Maria, as far as I know—are looking after her. All the works are, of course, performed by our people. All she needs to do is calculate the resources we have left…]]></string>
<string id="508959"><![CDATA[What led you to this peculiar situation?]]></string>
<string id="508960"><![CDATA[I respect Georgiy and generally recognize the Saburovs' rights... But we don't trust each other. As for Katerina—she is still a Mistress. She answers to the earth and keeps the whole town together like a single thread. If only my wife was alive... or my daughter was older... ]]></string>
<string id="508961"><![CDATA[I see. ]]></string>
<string id="508962"><![CDATA[I hope she won't tolerate any abuse. ]]></string>
<string id="508963"><![CDATA[Let's see if it helps at all first.]]></string>
<string id="508964"><![CDATA[If you truly care for it at all, I'd be rather grateful if from now on my recommendations were carried out precisely and without superfluous wranglings. ]]></string>
<string id="508965"><![CDATA[Oh my... Aren't you a… falcon…]]></string>
<string id="508966"><![CDATA[Please kindly spare me your comparisons, dear Vlad. ]]></string>
<string id="508967"><![CDATA[Silence! You whelp! If only you had the slightest idea of what I had, what I've lost, and what I've given away to these people—the people whose interests you are so eagerly defending—you would cool your ardour! The Olgimskys—once the richest industrialists of the area—are ruined now! ]]></string>
<string id="508968"><![CDATA[Listen…!]]></string>
<string id="508969"><![CDATA[Look at this, the lad is going to teach me! He's going to manage my property! Reproach me for giving less than I could—while I have nothing left!]]></string>
<string id="508970"><![CDATA[That's enough. If I have wronged you, I apologize. This nervous atmosphere has left me exhausted.]]></string>
<string id="508971"><![CDATA[If I ever took it in my head to compare you to an animal, it wouldn't take me long to find an analogy, master Vlad. Let's maintain proper business conduct.]]></string>
<string id="508972"><![CDATA[Actually, I was planning to be the first to have access to the confiscated drugs.]]></string>
<string id="508973"><![CDATA[You were not there... And now I'm forced—by your hand, if I might add—to report to governor Saburov... I had no time to hesitate, Bachelor. I'm sorry. The drugs have been confiscated and sealed up. ]]></string>
<string id="508974"><![CDATA[It's a result too. ]]></string>
<string id="508975"><![CDATA[You're in charge of the hospital now, aren’t you?]]></string>
<string id="508976"><![CDATA[I need a detailed report on the amount of pharmaceutical drugs we have. ]]></string>
<string id="508977"><![CDATA[I'd like to offer you a bargain. It has to do with your fugitives. ]]></string>
<string id="508978"><![CDATA[Oh, come now... To my mind, there's nothing to discuss here... However, a good bargain always catches my attention. So?]]></string>
<string id="508979"><![CDATA[I want you to stop pursuing them. What do you want in return? ]]></string>
<string id="508980"><![CDATA[Can you donate your runaways to me? I can guarantee that they'll die in the end.]]></string>
<string id="508981"><![CDATA[Hmm... Aren't you a humanitarian, my dear doctor... The thing is, I don’t need them to die. I need them to return to the bosom of the Bull Project... Punished, but unscathed. ]]></string>
<string id="508982"><![CDATA[Perfect. I'll do my best to return them safe then.]]></string>
<string id="508983"><![CDATA[What's in it for you?]]></string>
<string id="508984"><![CDATA[I have my own job to do and I need these people. As for now, sadly, I cannot disclose to you as to why.]]></string>
<string id="508985"><![CDATA[And what would you be willing... to offer?]]></string>
<string id="508986"><![CDATA[I'm ready to hear your offer. ]]></string>
<string id="508987"><![CDATA[I need the right that this caste seems to possess. They will dissect bodies for me. ]]></string>
<string id="508988"><![CDATA[I see... Yes, this is a respectable motivation. A single butcher will suffice for this.]]></string>
<string id="508989"><![CDATA[No, he won't. It's a dangerous and complicated task that will require many hands.]]></string>
<string id="508990"><![CDATA[Let me see... I know what I'm going to ask… as a payment for my butchers... It's the unique resource you own... the one I'll never get my hands on.]]></string>
<string id="508991"><![CDATA[Oh, come now… Any cutthroat can help you then... Try to make a deal with Bad Grief's bandits... That's the loss no one is ever going to, hehe, grieve about... And they're definitely knife-happy. The rites of the Kin and our own traditions mean nothing for them... ]]></string>
<string id="508992"><![CDATA[I have no desire to make deals with that type.]]></string>
<string id="508993"><![CDATA[In that case, I think I know a person of dubious reputation who will help me. I mean the son of Burakh, who's managed to clear himself of one charge only to get accused again immediately.]]></string>
<string id="508994"><![CDATA[Then there's nothing else I can help you with.]]></string>
<string id="508995"><![CDATA[Do you have a counter-offer which would suit us both?]]></string>
<string id="508996"><![CDATA[Wait a minute! I think we can find a different agreement…]]></string>
<string id="508997"><![CDATA[I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="508998"><![CDATA[What is it?]]></string>
<string id="508999"><![CDATA[Your influence with the Kains. I'll cease to pursue the butchers if Georgiy ceases... to pursue young Burakh. He isn't guilty. He has an airtight alibi against all charges... which I am willing to confirm. Let them leave him alone. Agreed? ]]></string>
<string id="509000"><![CDATA[If you're vouching for him, I'll inform the Kains as soon as I have a chance. ]]></string>
<string id="509002"><![CDATA[Indeed... Indeed... And I'd rather you convinced Rubin that young Burakh has nothing to do with... Isidor's tragic death. The thick-headed Rubin is the last one who still needs convincing anyway. The boy might be labelled a patricide, as if he hasn't had enough... You do see Rubin from time to time, I know that... ]]></string>
<string id="509003"><![CDATA[I'll pass your words to Rubin. ]]></string>
<string id="509004"><![CDATA[And I'd rather you avoided telling around that I know where Rubin is. ]]></string>
<string id="509011"><![CDATA[Why do you care for Isidor's son so much?]]></string>
<string id="509012"><![CDATA[We have... a common goal.]]></string>
<string id="509013"><![CDATA[I see. So you're saying he's completely innocent, right?]]></string>

<string id="509024"><![CDATA[I will richly reward a friend that finds Simon's body for me, and I will squeeze the last drop of blood from the mongrel who stole it!]]></string>

<string id="509026"><![CDATA[No. I was busy doing something else.]]></string>
<string id="509027"><![CDATA[Your eyes belie your words, esteemed Bachelor. However, I know that truth is the only idol you worship. I have no reason to mistrust you... or to doubt the decency of your intentions. ]]></string>
<string id="509028"><![CDATA[Thank you, Judge. ]]></string>
<string id="509029"><![CDATA[I am not a judge, my most honourable doctor. I am a lawmaker. And it sorrows me greatly to see the laws I have conceived overthrown and trampled underfoot. When you see Simon, take every care to deliver his body to me as soon as possible, and fully intact.]]></string>
<string id="509031"><![CDATA[Everything I do, I do according to the command of my conscience, believe me. It is my harshest judge. ]]></string>
<string id="509032"><![CDATA[Fair enough. You seem to be a person of keen judgement.]]></string>

<string id="509036"><![CDATA[I don't know.]]></string>
<string id="509037"><![CDATA[I believe it's somewhere near Isidor's makeshift laboratory. Rubin never leaves it, claiming to continue his observations.]]></string>
<string id="509038"><![CDATA[This information is invaluable, Bachelor, I am much obliged. I will allow Rubin a chance to explain himself before the day ends... perhaps there was nothing else he could do under the circumstances.

<string id="509044"><![CDATA[What is it? ]]></string>
<string id="509045"><![CDATA[The house in which Rubin lived and worked has been tainted by infectious mould and fallen prey to the looters! Our messengers searched every nook and cranny: neither Rubin nor Simon's body are in the house. Some of the people that helped to undertake the search are paying a terrible price; they've contracted the Sand Pest.]]></string>
<string id="509046"><![CDATA[Let's hope that Rubin will get in touch soon.]]></string>
<string id="509047"><![CDATA[Why do you altogether reject the idea that Rubin is hiding your brother's body for reasons of his own?]]></string>
<string id="509048"><![CDATA[What reasons could he have? It's simply impossible that he would do something like this. Stakh Rubin is a noble man. He would never stoop to such a heinous crime.]]></string>
<string id="509049"><![CDATA[Well... I suppose you know him better than I do.]]></string>
<string id="509053"><![CDATA[True, someone could have stolen the body to force our family into offering ransom for its return. In this case, Rubin's silence and absence might mean that he is in pursuit of the thieves.]]></string>
<string id="509060"><![CDATA[Is there anything I can do for you?]]></string>
<string id="509061"><![CDATA[Please help us recover the body, doctor! We are already much indebted to you for having identified Simon's killer. It's not your fault that the truth has turned out to be so distressing to us all... I implore you to help Simon, and us, once more. Find my brother's body!]]></string>
<string id="509062"><![CDATA[All right. I'll help you.]]></string>
<string id="509063"><![CDATA[The task is far from trivial. Where do I even start?]]></string>
<string id="509064"><![CDATA[I am indebted to you, dear doctor. Speak. I will be happy to grant any request that is within my power to fulfil.]]></string>
<string id="509065"><![CDATA[It has to do with Isidor Burakh's son.]]></string>
<string id="509066"><![CDATA[Yes, I know the man, if only by what the others have to say about him. Regrettably, I've yet to meet him personally. He was one of the main suspects in Simon's murder. He also hasn't cleared himself—not to my judgement, anyway—of the charge of murdering his own father. Now he is the main suspect in the theft of my brother's body. I hope you are not going to solicit forgiveness on his behalf?]]></string>
<string id="509067"><![CDATA[That is exactly what I'm going to do.]]></string>
<string id="509068"><![CDATA[No, never. ]]></string>
<string id="509069"><![CDATA[Ahem... This is one of the few requests that I am not prepared to meet. That is to say, I wouldn't be—if anyone other than you were asking. But I believe without a shadow of doubt that you are acting in good faith and with most noble intentions.]]></string>
<string id="509070"><![CDATA[Vlad Olgimsky vouches for his honesty and is prepared to be a witness for him on all the charges you've brought against him.]]></string>
<string id="509071"><![CDATA[So it was Olgimsky who asked you to intervene? Don't trust him, doctor! Don't trust him. Olgimsky has many qualities worthy of respect, but being honourable is not one of them. His honour ends where his avarice begins. If he is prepared to vouch for something, it is a clear indication that he is going to profit from it.]]></string>
<string id="509072"><![CDATA[So what do you want to ask of me? ]]></string>
<string id="509073"><![CDATA[Actually, it was Olgimsky who wanted to ask something of you.]]></string>
<string id="509074"><![CDATA[Young Burakh deserves to have a break. That's what I need of him now anyway.]]></string>
<string id="509075"><![CDATA[Very well, doctor. I will do what you ask of me. But having done that, I urge you to tell me who stole my brother's body as soon as you learn their identity. I promise I will not punish Burakh, only unless it turns out that he was the thief.]]></string>
<string id="509076"><![CDATA[You have my word.]]></string>
<string id="509077"><![CDATA[You have my word. And if I find out that Burakh was the culprit, you'll be the first to know.]]></string>
<string id="509078"><![CDATA[So? What did you see there?]]></string>
<string id="509079"><![CDATA[Everything's dead. The dead tissue would not allow the microbial culture to survive. We might have tried to force the bacteria to reproduce... the problem is, there are no bacteria left. The culture has perished.]]></string>
<string id="509080"><![CDATA[This is bad...]]></string>
<string id="509081"><![CDATA[Quite the opposite, colleague, this is outstanding! What we've just discovered allows us to suggest that Sand Pest does not linger in dead bodies. As soon as it kills an infected person, it leaves. It needs warm blood, rich in oxygen, to survive. ]]></string>
<string id="509082"><![CDATA[What does this mean?]]></string>
<string id="509083"><![CDATA[Firstly, it suggests that something as simple as house walls might provide a certain level of protection. Secondly, that the killer's life cycle is very short. Therefore, there is a natural restriction on how fast the disease can spread. As soon as the infection kills whoever carries it, it dies.]]></string>
<string id="509084"><![CDATA[This means the disease can be fought?]]></string>
<string id="509085"><![CDATA[Yes. There is hope. Although the enemy is invisible and ubiquitous, it is far from invulnerable. We have found at least one weakness.]]></string>
<string id="509086"><![CDATA[Keep your voice down. And listen carefully. I've told these people you're not the person who ordered the butchers to cut corpses. ]]></string>
<string id="509087"><![CDATA[Thank you. I appreciate that.]]></string>
<string id="509088"><![CDATA[But... ]]></string>
<string id="509089"><![CDATA[Silence! Don't "but" me. We need you alive. Why are you taunting these people? Fear and hatred have already put a dent in their obedience.]]></string>
<string id="509090"><![CDATA[What did you tell them? ]]></string>
<string id="509091"><![CDATA[I had to concede that there's an unknown ripper on the loose. Twice a criminal. For daring to raise his knife against the inviolability of a body, and for defiling the sacred peace of the dead. I told them you weren't the real ripper... and we've started a manhunt for the real one.]]></string>
<string id="509092"><![CDATA[No! Anything but this... How am I supposed to look in the eyes of those whom I promised non-interference?]]></string>
<string id="509093"><![CDATA[No names were named. I don't know who you're referring to—nor do I want to know! You hear me? I want nothing to do with cases about defiling the dead! My public line is, whoever is caught dissecting a body will be summarily executed and made an example of! Be more careful from now on.]]></string>
<string id="509094"><![CDATA[What am I to do now? ]]></string>
<string id="509095"><![CDATA[These patrolmen were keeping watch at the cemetery. Right now there is no one there. I will task them with blockading an infected district. And I will dispatch the next shift of guards to the cemetery ten minutes—do you hear?—ten minutes after you leave. You have a ten-minute headstart to do what you need to do.]]></string>
<string id="509096"><![CDATA[Thank you, governor! I understand and appreciate what this act has cost you. ]]></string>
<string id="509097"><![CDATA[These patrolmen will be sent to their deaths simply in order to provide cover for my actions? That must not happen.]]></string>
<string id="509098"><![CDATA[As you wish. But remember: if you leave your work undone, someone else will have to do it and pay with their life for it. ]]></string>
<string id="509099"><![CDATA[All right. I've changed my mind. Hold back the duty detail for as long as you can. ]]></string>
<string id="509100"><![CDATA[So be it. ]]></string>

<string id="509108"><![CDATA[Aren't butchers allowed to dissect bodies? ]]></string>
<string id="509109"><![CDATA[Bull carcasses, yes. That's kinda self-explanatory, no, good sir? Since when are they allowed to cut people's bodies for entertainment, though? Or do they know the lines? ]]></string>
<string id="509110"><![CDATA[Armed resistance. They must have thought Fat Vlad had sent us. But there's something fishy about this 'ere business!]]></string>

<string id="509112"><![CDATA[Whose entertainment? Their own?]]></string>
<string id="509113"><![CDATA[It gets worse. That beast carved 'im up and wrapped 'im up. Prepared 'im for something. Been waiting for the Ripper! He's still at large, is 'im that's killed old Burakh. Ain't gone nowhere; ain't fooling anyone! It was for 'im the butcher did it, no question about it...]]></string>
<string id="509114"><![CDATA[What in the world makes you think so?]]></string>
<string id="509115"><![CDATA[He was waiting for 'im, so he was... Anyway, it's all pointing towards it. Good thing we were there to dissuade 'im. But in a different neighbourhood, another butcher like that slipped away! I just got the report! How I'd love to give the beast a good thrashing! 'im and whoever's paying 'im! Shame I can't leave my post...]]></string>
<string id="509116"><![CDATA[Good fellows. Thank you for your service!]]></string>
<string id="509117"><![CDATA[I'd rather you not go to extremes like that next time. ]]></string>
<string id="509118"><![CDATA[And what happened to the body?]]></string>
<string id="509119"><![CDATA[The body was given to the family. They'll bury it. ]]></string>

<string id="509121"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="509122"><![CDATA[That villain, to chop up a lad like that... He must know his trade well, eh, dressing carcasses 'n the likes... Look, over there, they're carrying the body with all the cuttings. ]]></string>
<string id="509123"><![CDATA[Where to? ]]></string>
<string id="509124"><![CDATA[The cemetery, where else. To prepare for burial. Why d'ya ask, sir? ]]></string>

<string id="509132"><![CDATA[Was this body brought from an infected district? ]]></string>
<string id="509133"><![CDATA[Yes. We're preparing it for the burial. What's in it for you?]]></string>
<string id="509134"><![CDATA[I need it for my work. ]]></string>
<string id="509135"><![CDATA[No questions! Did governor Saburov forget to inform you of my mandate?]]></string>
<string id="509136"><![CDATA[Governor Saburov? Governor Saburov is not my commanding officer! I'm a volunteer—do you get that, doctor? Or do I need to spell it out for you?]]></string>
<string id="509137"><![CDATA[Perhaps we could strike a bargain?]]></string>
<string id="509138"><![CDATA[Silence! Know your place!]]></string>
<string id="509139"><![CDATA[Ain't that right... Well, doctor's work is vital work all right. It's not like you're body-snatching for fun, right? You're working in the interests of the public!]]></string>

<string id="509141"><![CDATA[Ten thousand money—and it's yours.]]></string>

<string id="509143"><![CDATA[I'm not gonna offer twice. ]]></string>
<string id="509144"><![CDATA[Deal. ]]></string>
<string id="509145"><![CDATA[All right. Here it is. ]]></string>
<string id="509146"><![CDATA[You will give it to me since that is my order. By the name of governor Saburov!]]></string>
<string id="509170"><![CDATA[Greetings, friend. I heard news of your arrival. Everyone has. Are you here to examine the body as well?]]></string>
<string id="509171"><![CDATA[...My dear colleague, I do hope you haven't touched it yet.]]></string>
<string id="509172"><![CDATA[I haven't. Is there a problem?]]></string>
<string id="509173"><![CDATA[Simon's body, wherever it is, poses a dire threat. I suspect he has died of a contagious disease.]]></string>
<string id="509174"><![CDATA[There is the threat of an epidemic. The Crucible needs to be quarantined. Any access to the body should be forbidden.]]></string>
<string id="509175"><![CDATA[No, the last thing I want to do in this life is to examine him without first taking preliminary measures.]]></string>
<string id="509176"><![CDATA[What? It seems you know something I don't.]]></string>
<string id="509177"><![CDATA[I have bad news for you. If we don't take measures soon we are in for a terrible ordeal. It seems like Simon died of a contagious disease.]]></string>
<string id="509178"><![CDATA[I don't believe it... A second outbreak... Wait a second, I need to regain my senses... Are you sure about this? Do you mean what you say?]]></string>
<string id="509179"><![CDATA[I am, and I do.]]></string>
<string id="509180"><![CDATA[If it's the Sand Plague... Master's death was so untimely! …If it's the Sand Plague, we only have a few more days to live. You see, I have no idea how to stop it. No one does.]]></string>
<string id="509181"><![CDATA[So you're already familiar with the disease?]]></string>
<string id="509182"><![CDATA[I'm only making assumptions. I don't want to believe this. I'd rather have any other plague than this!]]></string>
<string id="509183"><![CDATA[We have no time to waste. The body must be inspected. Isolated. Destroyed if necessary. We must take protective measures for that, of course.]]></string>
<string id="509184"><![CDATA[Your mentor has encountered this before? What is the Sand Plague?]]></string>
<string id="509185"><![CDATA[Why are you so scared?]]></string>
<string id="509187"><![CDATA[I'd rather leave that to you. I bid you farewell.]]></string>
<string id="509188"><![CDATA[Well... I will, of course, let you know the results.]]></string>
<string id="509189"><![CDATA[No need for that. I'll be far away by then.]]></string>
<string id="509190"><![CDATA[I know them already. They have proven to be quite unexpected.]]></string>
<string id="509191"><![CDATA[Really? Would you share them with me?]]></string>
<string id="509192"><![CDATA[You will see it all soon enough. I wish you luck.]]></string>
<string id="509193"><![CDATA[Dear colleague, Simon has died of a disease—contagious and most definitely lethal. Examining him without antiseptics is sentencing yourself to death.]]></string>
<string id="509194"><![CDATA[So you're leaving the examination to me? You have a subtle sense of humour. Although I wouldn't let a genius like you do the dirty work... Thank you for letting me know.]]></string>
<string id="509195"><![CDATA[What protection do you have? Antiseptics? Repellents? Vaccines?]]></string>
<string id="509196"><![CDATA[We need your diagnosis before we can provide reasonable protection. At the moment you can only buy yellow immunity boosters at the drug stores. They are no good... But I'll try to do something about this. We'll need to take some remedies from Master's old workplace. Did you know he was murdered by his son? An atrocity.]]></string>
<string id="509197"><![CDATA[His son has nothing to do with this. I presume Isidor was infected by Simon and died of the same disease. Or vice versa... Let us not waste any more time.]]></string>
<string id="509198"><![CDATA[You're right. Let's make haste. I'll get everything ready for the examination; meanwhile, let's arrange for the body to be isolated. Kain is keeping it in a cold place. I'll keep you informed.]]></string>
<string id="509199"><![CDATA[If we act deliberately, and with calm mind, we can prevent this epidemic. Stay strong, I won't leave you on your own.]]></string>
<string id="509200"><![CDATA[What kind of remedies do you speak of?]]></string>
<string id="509201"><![CDATA[That bastard! He deserves to be hanged by the neck until dead.]]></string>
<string id="509202"><![CDATA[I couldn't have done otherwise. I apologize for an inappropriate prank; please don't be angry with me. Where shall we start?]]></string>
<string id="509203"><![CDATA[Our damn rulers will never come to an agreement! Just like the corners of a triangle will never come together. It seems that now is the moment to let go of any feuds. But their actions are understandable... It's hard to bow down to Katerina. She can neither dream nor soothsay!]]></string>
<string id="509204"><![CDATA[Why is it "the moment"?]]></string>
<string id="509205"><![CDATA[We maintain balance on our own; nature has nothing to do with it. Our choices are what establishes the harmony that is essential for survival. Now is the time for them to realize it—now, when this balance has been disrupted by Simon's death. Katerina won't be able to rule like Nina or Victoria did. She has neither the power nor the talent.]]></string>
<string id="509206"><![CDATA[I don't understand a thing of what you're saying.]]></string>
<string id="509207"><![CDATA[As the Mistresses were dying, Katerina was throwing herself hither and thither, unable to choose a role; she tried to be Nina and she tried to be Victoria, but neither light nor darkness have worked out for her—she sucks at both. And you want us to listen to the Saburovs after that? Officially, they have the strongest claim to become the sole leaders. Katerina is the last Mistress after all. But her abilities are dubious. She told you you would die, didn't she? But, unfortunately, you're still alive. You can put two and two together on your own.]]></string>
<string id="509208"><![CDATA[I don't like people who speak in riddles.]]></string>
<string id="509209"><![CDATA[We'll come back to this conversation later.]]></string>
<string id="509210"><![CDATA[But Saburov doesn't understand that and is trying to take advantage of the situation?]]></string>
<string id="509211"><![CDATA[It's nice to talk to a smart guy. No, I think you've scared Saburov. However stupid, he is also honest. He'll demand power not because he has a lust for it, but because he needs it to fight the epidemic—the one that, with all due respect, no one but him believes in... However, for both Kain and Olgimsky his actions are an excuse to snatch more power.]]></string>
<string id="509212"><![CDATA[So the public doesn't believe in the threat of an epidemic either?]]></string>
<string id="509213"><![CDATA[The public believes there's an invisible maneater walking among them.]]></string>
<string id="509214"><![CDATA[They will have to face the truth soon enough. Is there a way to make the rulers believe the only reasonable man around here? Do the Saburovs have any weight?]]></string>
<string id="509215"><![CDATA[Aren't the Saburovs legally supposed to rule over you now?]]></string>
<string id="509216"><![CDATA[Why bow to Katerina? I thought Alexander was the one in charge.]]></string>
<string id="509217"><![CDATA[Alexander? Don't make me laugh. He borrows resolve from his spouse. Katerina can see the future—well, at least she is supposed to... It was Nina Kaina and Victoria Olgimskaya that ruled over us when they were alive. The rulers were nurturing the body of the town, while their wives were fostering its soul.]]></string>
<string id="509218"><![CDATA[Were the Mistresses able to come to an agreement?]]></string>
<string id="509294"><![CDATA[The hunt for the Steppe maneater has turned into a funeral carnival. This is how the Kains are laying the keeper of our life to rest.]]></string>
<string id="509295"><![CDATA[The Kains have the power, but it feels strange to see them use it like this.]]></string>
<string id="509296"><![CDATA[The Kains are no less magnificent than their turbulent fantasizing would suggest... They hold the utmost sacral authority. One could even say, they are the architects of the law by which we are to live. Conceivably, they should do their utmost to define and implement the boundaries which we should never transcend—after all this is the core function of any lawmaking entity. But then, do you know what is especially fascinating about the Kains? The boundaries are nowhere to be seen.]]></string>
<string id="509297"><![CDATA[Isn't an outlook like this supposed to hinder a ruler?]]></string>
<string id="509298"><![CDATA[Nina, may God have mercy on her soul, ruled over this place not quite unlike a vampire would govern her flock. Consequently, the people adore her even more now than when she was still alive. Whatever power Nina had to dominate the souls of her subjects, she hardly ever resorted to it. Not that she needed to: she was worshipped all the same and her most inhumane endeavours were eagerly forgiven. Just some food for thought, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="509299"><![CDATA[Why did everyone put up with her then?]]></string>
<string id="509300"><![CDATA[The reason would be, perhaps, that whatever Nina did, she did to appease the people. However cruel, her every undertaking would illuminate the town with festivity and high spirits. There is hardly a thing that people crave more than they crave spectacle.]]></string>
<string id="509301"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="509302"><![CDATA[Wouldn't have worked on me.]]></string>
<string id="509303"><![CDATA[Why would anyone love a person like that?]]></string>
<string id="509304"><![CDATA[They loved her for being a true queen. They love her for having died young.]]></string>
<string id="509305"><![CDATA[And that's what people like?]]></string>
<string id="509306"><![CDATA[Or maybe they're trying to scare evil spirits away...]]></string>
<string id="509322"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="509323"><![CDATA[Easing the pain of those who cannot be saved is also a worthy feat, isn't it? The military arithmetics are a double-edged knife. Is a doomed person already crossed out from the list of survivors? Even the dead deserve care.]]></string>
<string id="509324"><![CDATA[What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="509325"><![CDATA[It's not a good idea to try to take away from the living for the sake of the dead—but perhaps you should share a part of yourself with them. It will pay back in spades. He who helps the dying pass on painlessly is sparing the world unnecessary suffering. We respect that here. Being considerate may even help you atone for murder.]]></string>
<string id="509326"><![CDATA[So if you kill someone and then help several others pass on, the murder will be forgiven? I'll keep that in mind.]]></string>
<string id="509327"><![CDATA[No one will suffer unnecessarily.]]></string>
<string id="509328"><![CDATA[Military arithmetics is only a different way of caring for the living. You can't save everyone. It is smarter to make yourself busy with helping those who can still be saved...]]></string>
<string id="509329"><![CDATA[Sometimes they get way more care than the living.]]></string>
<string id="509330"><![CDATA[So you have seen for yourself that people differ greatly. Sad, but true. Some of them shine like stars, others are nothing but steppe grass. There is only one thing that makes them different. Truly outstanding people care for others and are even prepared to give up their lives for their fellow men. People of the crowd only care about themselves.]]></string>
<string id="509331"><![CDATA[Why are you telling me this?]]></string>
<string id="509332"><![CDATA[People will be willing to give up their lives for you, dear Bachelor, only to give you another chance to avert the forthcoming catastrophe. That is how you'll get to know them. Tell me, will you accept the sacrifices?]]></string>
<string id="509333"><![CDATA[No. I don't accept anyone's sacrifices. My job is to save human lives rather than waste them.]]></string>
<string id="509334"><![CDATA[The life of a person can become the fee you'll have to pay to see the events move forward—unless you'd be willing to contribute to them, of course. Their motives will also differ, but their ability to give up their lives for a higher cause stays the same. Plague is the measure of humanity.]]></string>
<string id="509335"><![CDATA[I only hope they wouldn't do it without my knowledge.]]></string>
<string id="509336"><![CDATA[Let them risk their lives, it's every person's right. But I don't want anyone to do it in my name.]]></string>
<string id="509337"><![CDATA[That's a strange way of compelling me to take action...]]></string>
<string id="509338"><![CDATA[I'll wait, see, and act appropriately.]]></string>
<string id="509339"><![CDATA[Why would they do something like that?]]></string>
<string id="509340"><![CDATA[I have. Strange how the size of their hearts corresponds with the size of their mansions—if one were to believe you, of course.]]></string>
<string id="509341"><![CDATA[Some people stand out while others don't. There's nothing more to it.]]></string>
<string id="509377"><![CDATA[You were right. The bloodsuckers and maneaters had nothing to do with this. Neither did the werewolves. Or the Dogheads. Or the Soul-and-a-Halves.]]></string>
<string id="509378"><![CDATA[Having an intelligent conversation with a reasonable person is a rare pleasure.]]></string>
<string id="509379"><![CDATA[Also there are these writings on walls. The Soul-and-a-Halves thought at first that a monster was leaving them: either a night mara, known to have two knees on each leg, her second shin longer than the first—or a shabnak, whose abominable inhumanity was alone capable of inventing such signs...]]></string>
<string id="509380"><![CDATA[What were those writings?]]></string>
<string id="509381"><![CDATA[They really do point to the murder, doctor! Figuratively, I mean. Do you know what "figuratively" means? It means not literally. It's the infected that write on the walls. If one had the bold mind of a poet, one could say the disease used the bodies of its victims to sully the walls with its signs!]]></string>
<string id="509382"><![CDATA[Well, Notkin, you're a poet indeed.]]></string>
<string id="509383"><![CDATA[I can neither understand nor accept the irony in your voice. I'm offering you crucial intelligence, damn it, and you're making a wry face! If you want to find hotbeds—look for the thematic signs! They're painted by people who are so weakened they can't even moan anymore! These are cries for help! Cries of despair, if you like.]]></string>
<string id="509384"><![CDATA[A fair reproach. I'll find these houses and find out what's going on inside them.]]></string>
<string id="509385"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="509386"><![CDATA[Yes, I know what “figuratively” means.]]></string>
<string id="509387"><![CDATA[Are they really this horrible?]]></string>
<string id="509422"><![CDATA[Fat Vlad is nervous... The feathers on his snout can be seen from a verst away. Why is the Station so quiet? Why are the Warehouses silent and still? Why is there no Kin chorus or bulls bellowing at the slaughterhouse? Boös knows something, that's a no-brainer...]]></string>
<string id="509423"><![CDATA[Tell me about Olgimsky. Does it hurt if I push here?]]></string>
<string id="509424"><![CDATA[The Olgimskys have always been good housekeepers. That's in their blood. Big Vlad is in charge of the whole Bull Project—the Warehouses, the Works, the Station, the railroad, and even the Abattoir with the butchers. I can't for the life of me imagine how he handles it all, but they do respect him...]]></string>
<string id="509425"><![CDATA[So what's the deal with snouts and feathers then?]]></string>
<string id="509426"><![CDATA[This is very uncharacteristic of him. They say that the Kains are easy to anger, but it's nothing compared to Vlad's wrath. The Kains are people of aesthetics, they play angry; but Vlad sincerely loses temper over everything. He's either preparing a blow on the Kains or is trying to redirect attention away from his hulk.]]></string>
<string id="509427"><![CDATA[I'll speak to him about this.]]></string>
<string id="509428"><![CDATA[I don't understand how you people get along here. At all.]]></string>
<string id="509429"><![CDATA[So he's the person that controls the Station, right?]]></string>
<string id="509430"><![CDATA[The railroad is the only cord that binds us to the big world. Freight trains travel along it. Now Kain has ordered to close the Station off to catch mara the killer. At other times this would be reason enough to go to war… but Vlad is surprisingly silent.]]></string>
<string id="509431"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="509432"><![CDATA[The slaughterhouse… You mean that neolithic tumour on the outskirts of the town?]]></string>
<string id="509433"><![CDATA[You are the tumour! It is the womb, if you will, that gave birth to everything you see around. Vlad is lining his pockets quite successfully from it…]]></string>
<string id="509434"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="509451"><![CDATA[The lust for profit and ambition have nothing to do with it. I think they're simply confused. The final balance point is destroyed, and our whole life is going down before our very eyes.]]></string>
<string id="509452"><![CDATA[What's the point of an equilibrium system if a single man's death threatens your whole way of living?]]></string>
<string id="509453"><![CDATA[Here's how it used to be. Saburov was the official leader, but Katerina was the weakest Mistress. The brilliant prophet Nina was Victor's wife, and the youngest Kain held no real power. Vlad was the richest, but Victoria stopped him from abusing his resources.]]></string>
<string id="509454"><![CDATA[What happened next?]]></string>
<string id="509455"><![CDATA[Nina died. The Kains would have lost the power over the soul of the town, but Simon seemed to have absorbed her spirit. Simon didn't rule; he was a creator. Katerina, who had been inclined towards Darkness before, became the Black Mistress...]]></string>
<string id="509456"><![CDATA[But she was held back by the White Mistress Victoria...]]></string>
<string id="509457"><![CDATA[The balance was restored. When Victoria died, Katerina rushed to take her place—she was quite afraid of playing games with Mother Darkness by then. The last of the Mistresses was struggling and throwing herself from one extreme to another. Her fiasco was made up for by Simon. He transferred all executive power over to Saburov, but brilliantly held the soul of the town in his grasp.]]></string>
<string id="509458"><![CDATA[And now none of the rulers knows what his family is in charge of?]]></string>
<string id="509459"><![CDATA[More or less.]]></string>
<string id="509460"><![CDATA[You have a curious idea of a government around here.]]></string>
<string id="509461"><![CDATA[We'll return to this subject later.]]></string>
<string id="509462"><![CDATA[So no one wants to bow his head to Katerina, who failed to become either a witch or an angel, right?]]></string>
<string id="509463"><![CDATA[That's pure stone age animism... Do you believe in reincarnation?]]></string>
<string id="509464"><![CDATA[I'm only trying to find the words that would be easy to understand. Don't you feel that this place is very different? Our town is a fragile ship that went out into the sea and got into a storm. Power balance is essential to our survival.]]></string>
<string id="509465"><![CDATA[And Victoria was your guardian?]]></string>
<string id="509466"><![CDATA[Lara, that's enough. I'm a civilized person. Please spare me this gibberish in the future.]]></string>
<string id="509467"><![CDATA[So the Mistresses' power complemented the power of the rulers to that extent? How could it be?]]></string>
<string id="509468"><![CDATA[First of all, they could see the future. Secondly, they breathed in unison with the earth, "listening to the Steppe." Finally... the aura of their spiritual force could be felt physically. The Mistresses maintained life in the town, changing its intensity; they were like energy clots.]]></string>
<string id="509469"><![CDATA[And that is no longer so?]]></string>
<string id="509470"><![CDATA[This is awful... A feudal structure. It isn't even feudal, it's prehistoric. I don't understand how you managed to survive like this.]]></string>
<string id="509471"><![CDATA[Why are they confused?]]></string>
<string id="509472"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="509473"><![CDATA[Those whom you save will speak for you.]]></string>
<string id="509474"><![CDATA[Speak for me? To whom?]]></string>
<string id="509475"><![CDATA[I don't know. The dead told me to remind you that you will be spoken for by those whom you save, that's all. Is it true that you're going to leave us soon?]]></string>
<string id="509476"><![CDATA[No, it's not.]]></string>
<string id="509477"><![CDATA[That's great! This means I'll get a chance to play with you.]]></string>
<string id="509478"><![CDATA[I don't have time for games.]]></string>
<string id="509479"><![CDATA[I get shivers down my spine when I imagine the games you might like to play.]]></string>
<string id="509480"><![CDATA[Of course.]]></string>
<string id="509481"><![CDATA[Yes, I'm leaving on the next train.]]></string>
<string id="509482"><![CDATA[There won't be a next train. There will only be the train that will unload boxes and take the meat; but they won't load the infected meat onto it.]]></string>
<string id="509483"><![CDATA[Infected meat?]]></string>
<string id="509484"><![CDATA[Yes. The town is full of bad meat. The people will start stocking on food, because they expect war. The executors will give them the infected meat from the Warehouses.]]></string>
<string id="509485"><![CDATA[Damn it...]]></string>
<string id="509486"><![CDATA[I'll deal with your Warehouses.]]></string>
<string id="509487"><![CDATA[I don't even want to know where this came from…]]></string>
<string id="509488"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="509489"><![CDATA[The three heads of the dragon are facing three different directions. Three powerful families, three clans are overturned by the wind. This wind got in through the breach torn by Simon's death. How will they cope? Will they be able to come to an agreement? The Masks do not know the answer to that question.]]></string>
<string id="509490"><![CDATA[And who does?]]></string>
<string id="509491"><![CDATA[The Masks are two, but the families are three. I suspect the extra family is just that: an extra. It's superfluous. Someone will have to let go of their power—before their fellow men remember a different art of letting.]]></string>
<string id="509492"><![CDATA[Letting it go to their head?]]></string>
<string id="509493"><![CDATA[Bloodletting. Fading into non-existence voluntarily is still better than perishing under the pressure put on you by implacable foes. Wouldn't you agree?]]></string>
<string id="509494"><![CDATA[I wouldn't. People are supposed to fight to the very end.]]></string>
<string id="509495"><![CDATA[More or less…]]></string>
<string id="509496"><![CDATA[Which of the three?]]></string>
<string id="509497"><![CDATA[You don't need me to tell you that; the answer is yours. They're so different... Which one do you prefer? You came to this town—and now there's one more piece on the board. You are not a queen, of course, but a rook at least. It's up to you.]]></string>
<string id="509498"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="509499"><![CDATA[Neither do I.]]></string>
<string id="509500"><![CDATA[I still don't understand how you came to the conclusion that the disease which killed Simon is contagious. Even if we assume that the rumours of a death carrier are nothing but rumours... which I doubt.]]></string>
<string id="509501"><![CDATA[Call it intuition, if you will.]]></string>
<string id="509502"><![CDATA[If you are right, Bachelor, and there really is going to be a Sand Plague epidemic in this town, there will be no stopping it. You don't need to waste your life, and you cannot help us in any way. Your only goal is to survive until the Station is reopened.]]></string>
<string id="509503"><![CDATA[Peculiar fatalism. Are you saying that the services of an educated medic won't be of any help to you?]]></string>
<string id="509504"><![CDATA[Education is of no use here. Isidor may have had no medical education, but he managed to drive the demon back to hell. By the way, he mentioned that one can't beat the plague by traditional means.]]></string>
<string id="509505"><![CDATA[What means can it be beaten with then?]]></string>
<string id="509506"><![CDATA[It cannot be beaten. Isidor was a wise man. He was born here and knew many things that no education can provide. Bachelor, your goal is to survive. Save your talent for the Capital. Leave this place. My father will be happy to assist you.]]></string>
<string id="509507"><![CDATA[I'll speak to your father.]]></string>
<string id="509508"><![CDATA[Thank you for the advice, but I will decide what to do with my talent on my own.]]></string>
<string id="509509"><![CDATA[I will find my own way to stop the disease.]]></string>
<string id="509510"><![CDATA[According to certain people, even that won't be an easy task.]]></string>
<string id="509511"><![CDATA[When will the Station be reopened?]]></string>
<string id="509512"><![CDATA[It’s probably best to aim for the time after they've stopped hunting the maneater and before the town is quarantined… Speak with my father.]]></string>
<string id="509513"><![CDATA[I will.]]></string>
<string id="509514"><![CDATA[There has already been an outbreak of an unknown disease in your town. I used to occasionally communicate with Isidor Burakh, the man who put an end to it.]]></string>
<string id="509515"><![CDATA[...But I'm sure Isidor never told you about this. The brief encounter with the Sand Plague put him in a state of primal terror. Did you know that? His opinion of his role in stopping the outbreak was not very high… and he ascribed that victory solely to circumstance.]]></string>
<string id="509516"><![CDATA[It's strange he didn't suspect anything when examining Simon...]]></string>
<string id="509517"><![CDATA[Anyone who doesn't believe there's an outbreak is a perfect fool. We need to block off everything! Delay is tantamount to death. Right?]]></string>
<string id="509518"><![CDATA[Right, but how do you know all this?]]></string>
<string id="509519"><![CDATA[Look. When people thought a maneater was in the town, they locked their doors up. Only the brave ones didn't—and those who somehow knew that the rumours were all fibs. Got it?]]></string>
<string id="509520"><![CDATA[Not yet.]]></string>
<string id="509521"><![CDATA[Whatever. Most folks just hid in their homes. Even those who joined the hunt locked the doors behind them, I checked that myself. Can't blame them—she managed to get into that Focus inside The Crucible after all…]]></string>
<string id="509522"><![CDATA[All right. So?]]></string>
<string id="509523"><![CDATA[And now some houses are standing ajar. They say there's moaning coming from inside. All in all, no one in their right mind would invite the disease to their home. I'd say that kind of welcome is a bad sign.]]></string>
<string id="509524"><![CDATA[So you think I'm going to walk around pushing every door until one of them opens?]]></string>
<string id="509525"><![CDATA[What for? That's stupid. Even I wouldn't do that. There are other clues that set a dangerous place apart. Ask some guys around here. As for the girls, you can ask Grace and Capella. Not Murky though—her imagination is getting the better of her. She makes up a lot of weird stuff that gives me chills.]]></string>
<string id="509526"><![CDATA[Thanks for your advice.]]></string>
<string id="509527"><![CDATA[So the locals leave their doors open when there is no hope left... A nice custom. Quite useful.]]></string>
<string id="509528"><![CDATA[A thought-provoking observation.]]></string>
<string id="509529"><![CDATA[The capability of a mob to draw correct conclusions from incorrect premises would work as a great thesis subject... What are you hinting at?]]></string>
<string id="509530"><![CDATA[True, I've seen very few open doors so far. And?]]></string>
<string id="509531"><![CDATA[Yes... Georgiy is beside himself... However, I don't have the power to defy his orders. He is the eldest in the family. I'm doing everything I can to make him face the terrible truth. Simon wasn't immortal, but that neither entitles nor compels us to despair.]]></string>
<string id="509532"><![CDATA[What can I do for you?]]></string>
<string id="509533"><![CDATA[Before you leave this place, please, save as many people as you can. I will reward you for every life you save. If only I could, I would get myself tools and medicine and walk around the town curing the infected.]]></string>
<string id="509534"><![CDATA[I'll do everything I can. I've said this many times…]]></string>
<string id="509535"><![CDATA[All right. Anyway, how does one leave this place? I'm not talking about myself, just asking about the available means.]]></string>
<string id="509536"><![CDATA[...Olgimsky owns the fleet of carriages and locomotives. Perhaps you'll be able to strike a deal with him. Moreover, a regular train with factory goods and provisions is due to arrive any day now. After unloading, it will head back immediately. Good luck.]]></string>
<string id="509537"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="509538"><![CDATA[This train must be allowed in, but cannot be allowed out. Don't worry, I won't leave your town until I make sure the disease has been contained.]]></string>
<string id="509539"><![CDATA[I need to leave the town as soon as possible. Matters of great importance await me in the Capital. The people I'm responsible for there are in danger.]]></string>
<string id="509540"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="509567"><![CDATA[I'm sorry. How's it going, esteemed doctor?]]></string>
<string id="509568"><![CDATA[I'm not finished yet.]]></string>
<string id="509569"><![CDATA[I've been informed today that you have received a direct order from your immediate supervisors. You are supposed to curb the epidemy at any cost and… as far as I understood, you are also our only protection from the heartless inquisitor sent here by the Powers That Be.

<string id="509570"><![CDATA[Yes, it is.]]></string>
<string id="509571"><![CDATA[Not quite.]]></string>
<string id="509572"><![CDATA[Who told you that?]]></string>
<string id="509573"><![CDATA[Oh, I've got some metropolitan contacts… Come now. You are not the only outsider here.]]></string>
<string id="509574"><![CDATA[What you're saying is there have been new people coming from the outer word recently, am I correct?]]></string>
<string id="509575"><![CDATA[Don’t look for plots and schemes where none exist, dear Bachelor. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors. Do report to me as soon as you're finished.]]></string>
<string id="509577"><![CDATA[I need your help, master Vlad. ]]></string>
<string id="509578"><![CDATA[I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="509579"><![CDATA[I won't be able to finish the current task without a weapon.]]></string>
<string id="509580"><![CDATA[Please do not overestimate my powers. My former possesions do not belong to me anymore. Since yesterday I'm nothing more than a manager serving the items required. I can only provide you with what I currently have.]]></string>
<string id="509581"><![CDATA[Many thanks.]]></string>
<string id="509582"><![CDATA[It's not enough. And so I'm once again on my own…]]></string>
<string id="509583"><![CDATA[I need antibiotics and antiseptic drugs. You're well aware that the stock has been plundered, but I've heard that you keep a strategic supply. ]]></string>
<string id="509584"><![CDATA[I need a lot of money—at least according to my definition of "a lot of". The sum I require would be a tiny piece of nothing for an industrialist and a town-owner.]]></string>
<string id="509585"><![CDATA[How do you get your mail, master Vlad?]]></string>
<string id="509586"><![CDATA[Just like you do.]]></string>
<string id="509587"><![CDATA[And how do you send it? Do couriers leave the blocked town? Or do you send carrier pigeons to cover eight days' worth of travel?]]></string>
<string id="509588"><![CDATA[A witty answer. I couldn't have hoped for a better one.]]></string>
<string id="509589"><![CDATA[The matter turned out to be more complicated than I predicted.]]></string>
<string id="509590"><![CDATA[Find someone else to do the job, master Vlad.]]></string>
<string id="509591"><![CDATA[I've heard that several noble people are endeavoring to snatch dangerous tasks from you. But their lives are a hundred times more at risk than yours… Still.. Pray forgive me… If you will be able to look their nearest and dearest in the eye afterwards... do as you please.]]></string>
<string id="509592"><![CDATA[Don't worry, I'll deal with everything myself.]]></string>
<string id="509593"><![CDATA[I just wanted to stress that I actually owe you nothing.]]></string>
<string id="509594"><![CDATA[You've done my yesterday's work, haven't you, doctor?]]></string>
<string id="509595"><![CDATA[I've done what had to be done to thwart the danger.]]></string>
<string id="509596"><![CDATA[I don't know if there is a point to it though… The absolute mortality rate is a generally recognized fact… Victor, dare I say, has even endeavored to prove it… Did you know?]]></string>
<string id="509597"><![CDATA[Yes. This is exactly what I've been working on.]]></string>
<string id="509598"><![CDATA[Yes… There's no one to cure. The only thing we can do is trying to keep those who have dodged the Scythe safe. An isolation ward could have been useful, but... they say the Sand Dirt has rather unusual means of spreading… is it true that it bites at you as soon as you allow yourself to think about it?]]></string>
<string id="509599"><![CDATA[No. This is absolute rubbish.]]></string>
<string id="509600"><![CDATA[Is that so… Anyway, dear Bachelor, I have a confession to make. You've given me enough hints to show that you already have a suspicion. It's hard, but I cannot allow myself to remain silent.]]></string>
<string id="509601"><![CDATA[I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="509602"><![CDATA[The disease has infiltrated the Termitary. I'm still keeping it locked up. It used to be requisite to keep the disease out—and now I want it in, lest it spills into the streets. And I think you can fathom what that would entail…]]></string>
<string id="509603"><![CDATA[Just as I thought!]]></string>
<string id="509604"><![CDATA[Tomorrow we'll have a talk. I want to see it in person.]]></string>
<string id="509605"><![CDATA[I'm a generally suspicious person, you know. Speak. Confession is good for the soul.]]></string>
<string id="509606"><![CDATA[Indeed. Better me learning about it than an inquisitor. Their trials are swift, their executions—brutal.]]></string>
<string id="509607"><![CDATA[Some conditions are more likely to emerge when the potential patient has a certain psychological predisposition towards them. Cancer, for example, is considered to be one of these.]]></string>

<string id="509626"><![CDATA[Make it twenty. ]]></string>
<string id="509627"><![CDATA[No. It's either twenty five or get lost. Get back here when you've got the whole sum; otherwise, well… where nothin' is to be had the king must lose his right.

<string id="509632"><![CDATA[It's settled then. Twenty five it is.]]></string>
<string id="509633"><![CDATA[Twenty. Whatever's inside, it's still a very hefty sum. You won't regret it, old fence.]]></string>

<string id="509661"><![CDATA[Why was it closed?]]></string>
<string id="509662"><![CDATA[It doesn't meet the health regulations. Yesterday some people tried to turn it into a conference chamber—use it to invite elected representatives from the common people to cooperate on the plague issue.]]></string>
<string id="509663"><![CDATA[It's good that it was closed. Now open it up. I need to inspect the building and arrange to have it converted into a hospital.]]></string>
<string id="509664"><![CDATA[The people demanded that? And were denied? By who?]]></string>
<string id="509665"><![CDATA[If you know what's good for you, you'll open it for me and smile in the process, too. A ruler's order.]]></string>

<string id="509669"><![CDATA[Then please be so kind as to tell me what I can do for you.]]></string>
<string id="509670"><![CDATA[I've been told that Immortell gave you the keys to the Theatre.]]></string>
<string id="509671"><![CDATA[But he didn't order the Theatre closed! That came from above. They told us to keep people from gathering in one place by any means. Truth is, in times such as this, the theatre is the one place where people flock to in droves.]]></string>

<string id="509680"><![CDATA[I need your help.]]></string>
<string id="509681"><![CDATA[I wish to thank you!]]></string>
<string id="509682"><![CDATA[What do you offer?]]></string>
<string id="509683"><![CDATA[The keys that I gave you, most excellent Bachelor, will become municipal property. They will be handed over to the person overseeing the hospital… or whatever facility you are going to turn our theatre into.]]></string>
<string id="509684"><![CDATA[A hospital, yes.]]></string>
<string id="509685"><![CDATA[You do have a sense of humour after all. Although the Theatre has always been a hospital in a way; we just used to mend souls rather than bodies there.]]></string>
<string id="509686"><![CDATA[Then a hospital it will remain.]]></string>
<string id="509687"><![CDATA[I'm listening, so keep talking. The keys will be handed over to the overseers—and?]]></string>
<string id="509688"><![CDATA[You'll be unable to visit the place at your own discretion. Somehow I feel it's going to become off-limits soon.]]></string>
<string id="509689"><![CDATA[For everyone except myself.]]></string>
<string id="509690"><![CDATA[Are you offering me key copies?]]></string>
<string id="509691"><![CDATA[So the legends of your mind-boggling prescience were true! Indeed. We actors do not wish to deprive ourselves of your company. We need an audience to stage our performances for; we need a volunteer to tell them their fate… But I was actually planning to offer you this bottle as a sign of our goodwill...]]></string>
<string id="509692"><![CDATA[Thank you, actor. I'll drink it to your health.]]></string>
<string id="509693"><![CDATA[I do have the keys to those doors. I'll visit your rehearsals.]]></string>
<string id="509694"><![CDATA[A morgue.]]></string>

<string id="509697"><![CDATA[You'll see for yourself. I think the chance will present itself soon enough.]]></string>
<string id="509698"><![CDATA[A mental ward, just as it used to be.]]></string>

<string id="509700"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="509701"><![CDATA[Dankovsky! Finally—I've been looking for you. Taking the opportunity, I'd like to say how much we admire your fearlessness… and the fact that you're unafraid to walk this hell personally. You're… well… good job! Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="509702"><![CDATA[Forget it. Why were you looking for me?]]></string>
<string id="509703"><![CDATA[Oh, right. I have the keys to the Cathedral. Big Vlad told me you were going to turn it into a… ward?]]></string>
<string id="509704"><![CDATA[I am.]]></string>
<string id="509705"><![CDATA[You know, our Cathedral… Oh, nevermind, I don't want to waste your time whining. What I wanted to say is this may be the only chance for it to fulfill its purpose. Perhaps it will finally host a miracle after all.]]></string>
<string id="509706"><![CDATA[That's fine. Give me the keys.]]></string>
<string id="509707"><![CDATA[Then I bid you farewell. It seems unlikely that I'll be able to get out of here at all; I have a bad feeling about it. But I wish you the best of luck!]]></string>

<string id="509709"><![CDATA[Best of luck to you too.]]></string>
<string id="509710"><![CDATA[And you, of course, have a problem with that.]]></string>
<string id="509711"><![CDATA[Seems like I've been looking for you too.]]></string>
<string id="509712"><![CDATA[Most grateful for the company. I just knew I wouldn't be able to leave that place trouble-free, I had a gut feeling. Is there anything I can offer to you to return the favour?]]></string>

<string id="509714"><![CDATA[Can't say I'm a wealthy person. I'm almost broke, but I do have a small bottle of a certain precious beverage. Do you know what this is?]]></string>
<string id="509715"><![CDATA[Twyrine?]]></string>
<string id="509716"><![CDATA[The main issue with twyrine is its unpredictability. Drinking it suddenly boosts your immunity—and then after some time it's gone, similarly without warning… Sometimes there's no effect at all. But, well, it's not so well-loved for its effect; those helpful properties were only discovered after the plague broke out...]]></string>
<string id="509717"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="509718"><![CDATA[Find a better use for it.]]></string>

<string id="509725"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="509726"><![CDATA[Dankovsky! Would you be so kind as to tell me what's going on?]]></string>
<string id="509727"><![CDATA[Why is the Cathedral closed?]]></string>
<string id="509728"><![CDATA[Olgimsky's men locked it up. Lately, those armed servants of his have been acting like they own the place! He had ordered them to straight out kill anyone who tries to leave the Termitary—and, well, that order did nothing to improve their moral stance…]]></string>
<string id="509729"><![CDATA[Who has the keys to the Cathedral?]]></string>
<string id="509730"><![CDATA[My cousins have the keys. They both went to the Hindquarters on some business with Andrey Stamatin.]]></string>
<string id="509731"><![CDATA[Very well. I'll find your cousins.]]></string>
<string id="509732"><![CDATA[What business could they have with that thug?]]></string>
<string id="509733"><![CDATA[I don't know… They don't report to me. So how's it going? Have you figured out a cure already?]]></string>
<string id="509734"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="509735"><![CDATA[The sooner we are done with all this pointless scurrying, the sooner I will do just that. Do me a favour and mention that to anyone with any sort of authority whenever you get the chance.]]></string>
<string id="509736"><![CDATA[Did he really give such an order?]]></string>
<string id="509737"><![CDATA[Yes. And they even executed—the order, I mean… oh… well. It happened more than once—I've heard there are thirteen people dead already. And you didn't hear it from me, but supposedly several runaways managed to escape and have gone into hiding. Olgimsky is offering a hefty two thousand for any information about each of them. ]]></string>
<string id="509738"><![CDATA[Just information?]]></string>
<string id="509739"><![CDATA[Only if it proves to be true, of course. Some have already been caught.]]></string>
<string id="509740"><![CDATA[How do I get inside the Cathedral?]]></string>
<string id="509741"><![CDATA[Fine. Who can open the Cathedral?]]></string>
<string id="509742"><![CDATA[The End of the World. I need to get inside. And you need to gather as many people as you can and put yourself to work on some public services.]]></string>
<string id="509743"><![CDATA[What do we need to do?]]></string>
<string id="509744"><![CDATA[Whatever I instruct you to after I inspect the building.]]></string>
<string id="509745"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="509746"><![CDATA[A hole in any body is a very intimate thing. Even your natural orifices are better off closed or covered. Cover your mouth when you yawn, else the soul may fly out. Cower in the corner when you defecate. Cover youselves with sheets and darkness when you copulate. It's the orifices rather than people that make all those processes taboo.]]></string>
<string id="509747"><![CDATA[Come on, this is drunken rhetoric… ]]></string>
<string id="509748"><![CDATA[And the unnatural holes—don't even get me started! Who can tell if the body wants to be opened? How is it meant to be cut? A carcass only welcomes the touch of a master. The cut of a master follows the line that liberates the body from itself.]]></string>
<string id="509749"><![CDATA[Haven't you ever... how did you put it? "Created unnatural holes in bodies"? You seem to have mastered the art of knifing.]]></string>
<string id="509750"><![CDATA[The issue, my good Daniil, is that I've mastered the art of pencilling even better.]]></string>
<string id="509751"><![CDATA[Did you kill someone with a pencil? ]]></string>
<string id="509752"><![CDATA[Save your salt for someone else's wound! If only it were a man... It's just a theory though. Let us drink to bold endeavours, Bachelor! Let us fucking open up everything that's supposed to lie hidden under wraps! No need to restrict ourselves. We may as well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb!]]></string>
<string id="509753"><![CDATA[Drink ahead. And cheers to your liver.]]></string>
<string id="509754"><![CDATA[Thank you. I'd rather take a bottle to drink off the premises.]]></string>
<string id="509755"><![CDATA[The pen is mightier than the sword, everybody knows that.]]></string>
<string id="509756"><![CDATA[Eastern philosophy... Can't say it sits well with me.]]></string>
<string id="509757"><![CDATA[What are you driving at? ]]></string>
<string id="509758"><![CDATA[It's simply an unwelcome sight—that is all there's to it.]]></string>
<string id="509759"><![CDATA[Pardon me? Since the head standing before me is celebrated for its inability to utter commonplace truisms, I can only assume that the wisest of bachelors is laughing at me. Or do they explain any taboo with this drivel in the Capital these days?]]></string>
<string id="509760"><![CDATA[Perhaps there might be some sense to what you're saying.]]></string>
<string id="509761"><![CDATA[There's a beast sleeping in any of us—I'm not denying that. A beast startled by any orifice or hole.]]></string>
<string id="509762"><![CDATA[Hats off to the fine guest. Do get intoxicated with us, you prisoner of science!]]></string>
<string id="509763"><![CDATA[Listen, why does any attempt to examine a dead body lead to so many complications around here?]]></string>
<string id="509764"><![CDATA[The bastards deserve to be exterminated. No one will punish you for killing a criminal. An official decree was just announced by Saburov's men.]]></string>
<string id="509765"><![CDATA[So what, are you planning to get your hands dirty too?]]></string>
<string id="509766"><![CDATA[And why not? Muggers and killers hold nothing sacred—so they are exempt from sacred laws and traditions. They pulled their knives first. You're free to disembowel them, tear their arms off, and perforate them to your heart's content.]]></string>
<string id="509767"><![CDATA[Glad to hear that.]]></string>
<string id="509768"><![CDATA[There's no need to perforate anyone, be they innocent or guilty.]]></string>
<string id="509769"><![CDATA[That makes my job easier.]]></string>
<string id="509770"><![CDATA[If you care for your bodies so much, how come there are so many murderers roaming the streets? Am I not supposed to hurt them too?]]></string>
<string id="509805"><![CDATA[I don't see any reason to continue. The microbe does not live in a non-organic environment. It's a curious phenomenon… but it leaves us without a leg to stand on.]]></string>
<string id="509806"><![CDATA[Really? Why?]]></string>
<string id="509807"><![CDATA[Because the quantity of the vaccine I can produce with what I am able to recover from my source is preposterously small. I will compound the solution, though. Truth be told, I've started the process already.]]></string>
<string id="509808"><![CDATA[So you've managed to procure the living microbial culture? But how?]]></string>
<string id="509809"><![CDATA[Not really... Whatever weak specimens I've gathered from... the source I've mentioned... the culture is almost dead, even though I try my best to sustain it. The first samples of the medicine will be ready by tomorrow morning. It won't qualify as a vaccine... but it will offer some kind of protection.]]></string>
<string id="509810"><![CDATA[This is most certainly better than nothing. Anything else I could help you with?]]></string>
<string id="509811"><![CDATA[You look like you could use some sleep, Bachelor. As for me, I am dog-tired, which is made worse by the twyrine fumes making any kind of mental focus impossible. Tomorrow I will try to find young Burakh myself. I also might be able to sneak into the Termitary to speak with the Kin.]]></string>
<string id="509812"><![CDATA[Very well. I'll see you tomorrow. ]]></string>
<string id="509813"><![CDATA[I hope the first batch of the vaccine will be ready tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="509814"><![CDATA[Do tell me more. What did you use on it?]]></string>
<string id="509815"><![CDATA[I've made something of the kind already. It's untested though... I'll try to find a volunteer tonight. I wouldn't hesitate to try it myself, but taking personal risks is hardly viable, what with the lack of medics or physicians in the town. If I die you will be the last.]]></string>
<string id="509816"><![CDATA[Give the sample to me. I will have the vaccine tested.]]></string>
<string id="509817"><![CDATA[This is not a vaccine, doctor. From your perspective it's more like some useless swill, of a kind a child would make. I wouldn't go about testing it if I were you. But, if you are convinced that you can afford the risk—take the sample. Do let me know if there are any meaningful results.]]></string>
<string id="509818"><![CDATA[I am quite convinced, yes, and I will make sure to inform you.]]></string>
<string id="509819"><![CDATA[I'm not sure I want the risk... Let us find a volunteer first. Then we'll see where it takes us.]]></string>
<string id="509820"><![CDATA[A vaccine is not an easy thing to produce. Are you telling me you will be able to make one right here in this shed of yours?]]></string>
<string id="509821"><![CDATA[And failed, obviously.]]></string>
<string id="509823"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="509824"><![CDATA[Right now my only desire is to light up candles, wash the soot of the day off, wrap myself in a bedsheet and get drunk... until my mind goes blank. Will you get us a bottle of twyrine? ]]></string>
<string id="509825"><![CDATA[I'll do so if I find one. Do you want us to get drunk together? ]]></string>
<string id="509826"><![CDATA[Of course.]]></string>
<string id="509827"><![CDATA[I'm afraid that's not possible. I can't allow myself to drink now.]]></string>
<string id="509828"><![CDATA[If twyrine actually is 70% strong, it's an efficient preventative remedy. Drink it, Eva. ]]></string>
<string id="509829"><![CDATA[Who is "us"? If you thought I would drink twyrine, you were mistaken.]]></string>
<string id="509830"><![CDATA[What a shame... Then I'll have to drink either alone or with my gentle girlfriends... ]]></string>
<string id="509831"><![CDATA[Meanwhile I will be working, Eva. Each minute of my work is a life saved. Several lives, perhaps. ]]></string>
<string id="509832"><![CDATA[Eva, I don't even have time to sleep these days.]]></string>
<string id="509833"><![CDATA[Neither do I. Don't worry... If you pay me a visit tonight, I won't let you sleep. ]]></string>

<string id="509837"><![CDATA[You can always get it in the Factus. That's what the den in the Hindquarters is called now—it used to be Golghoy Khen... Ask Andrey or Peter, tell them it's for me. The twins will go to the end of earth to get it if need be.]]></string>
<string id="509838"><![CDATA[I'll try. ]]></string>
<string id="509839"><![CDATA[No, Eva. The orgy is cancelled. I scrambled through a hard evening, and an even harder night is ahead of me. ]]></string>

<string id="509852"><![CDATA[I need the body of a sand plague victim to extract an infection sample.]]></string>
<string id="509853"><![CDATA[Ah, you mean you wanna cut? No cuttin', doc, no way! Nope. Not allowed. I'm tellin' you as the materialst that I am, either them zealots'll tear your arms away from them sockets, or some ugly seethin' pest'll crawl outta Steppe. I'm sayin' that from experience, I am. My lot, they prefer stranglin' with a cord.]]></string>

<string id="509884"><![CDATA[If anything goes wrong, do tell me. My father is truly a miserable man. Can you imagine how heavy the burden of his responsibility is? He is in charge of the lives of several thousands of people!]]></string>

<string id="509897"><![CDATA[It is known for a fact that no one gets sick in the Polyhedron.

<string id="510147"><![CDATA[Obviously it's not one of the houses that were infected yesterday, is it?]]></string>
<string id="510148"><![CDATA[Well… Actually, it is. Nevertheless, we've made a most peculiar observation: there isn't a single trace of infection in these houses today. We've learnt it by chance… thanks to marauders. They stalk these places with no antibiotics whatsoever. Victor Kain would like to discuss this matter with you.]]></string>
<string id="510149"><![CDATA[Fine. That will do. I'll get back at you after I examine the place.]]></string>
<string id="510150"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="510151"><![CDATA[I'm so glad nothing bad happened to you yesterday…]]></string>
<string id="510152"><![CDATA[Is it true you're planning to host an isolation ward? Do you realize what it entails?]]></string>
<string id="510153"><![CDATA[I didn't have a choice.]]></string>
<string id="510154"><![CDATA[Didn't have a choice? Why?]]></string>
<string id="510155"><![CDATA[I had to do it to protect the… privacy of certain information. The good name of a certain person… and most likely the life of another one depend on it. Surely that's reason enough? Forgive me, it's uncomfortable for me to talk about it.]]></string>
<string id="510159"><![CDATA[Wait. You have no water? How is that possible?]]></string>
<string id="510178"><![CDATA[Three ends, actually… It can end in three different ways. The town has been teetering on the verge for far too long… Balancing on the edge… like a ball trying to choose one of the three pockets. If it doesn't fall into one of them soon, the edge will rip it apart... The body will rot with bloody mould, and plague will devour this land...]]></string>
<string id="510179"><![CDATA[Er... What? ]]></string>
<string id="510180"><![CDATA[Simon has built a puzzle... Everybody he Bound were generally Utopians or Termites… But I insist that he's built the town as a triangle… and so I declare loyalty to the third idea—the faith of Humility! I am their Mistress. There's neither heat nor cold anymore; there is only Earth...]]></string>
<string id="510181"><![CDATA[What is to be, will be.]]></string>
<string id="510182"><![CDATA[Please be so kind as to notice... there stands a girl. Her name is Clara, and it's within her hands to tie or untie our fate... It's fine if you don't want to help... She will make sure that the new balance that arises... is proper…]]></string>
<string id="510183"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="510184"><![CDATA[This blessed girl has the power to decide... who lives and who dies. She has the right... My spouse and I trust her. She is the emissary of fate, a guardian angel... Not a harbinger, like I used to think… but rather a miracle maker... ]]></string>
<string id="510185"><![CDATA[Wait a minute. So what am I supposed to do?]]></string>
<string id="510186"><![CDATA[What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="510187"><![CDATA[Simon's woven equal shares of love and hate into this town… His genius kept the feelings of those who adhered to the three different principles in check… he knew how to derive benefit from their contrariety… Now discord has become meaningless. Like the town itself, the three-pointed taglur is frozen in a deadly stalemate... The town's fall is inevitable.]]></string>
<string id="510188"><![CDATA[Keep in mind the three outcomes, please. The town is overburdened... it's filled with too many unnecessary things… So reconfigure the fates. Our future path will be decided by the new list of the Bound… as shall the future outlook of our miserable little world... Speak to the dazzling Maria about this, if you will...]]></string>
<string id="510189"><![CDATA[I will. You're scaring me.]]></string>
<string id="510194"><![CDATA[So that's how it is. Clearly, Simon has not reached the end of his earthly path yet... ]]></string>
<string id="510195"><![CDATA[Are you aware of Katerina's recent claims?]]></string>
<string id="510196"><![CDATA[No. What, did she decide to make herself heard again?]]></string>
<string id="510197"><![CDATA[Yes. She's made a prophecy—that I won't take seriously, of course. But you might find it interesting.]]></string>
<string id="510198"><![CDATA[What was it? About the doomed ones? Probably so, since she must be seeing more or less the same things that I see, though from an entirely different angle. Katerina is older than me, but her visions are distorted by a prophet known as Morphine. Too much noise.]]></string>
<string id="510199"><![CDATA[She spoke about a taglur that is smothering itself, and therefore requires a corrective intervention—involving blood.]]></string>
<string id="510200"><![CDATA[Oh, my goodness... Clara will confound our plans. She is a formidable opponent. She will cause a public commotion; she will make people die. She'll be unstoppable. The important thing is to try to ensure the survival of those who have put their trust in you.]]></string>
<string id="510201"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="510202"><![CDATA[I shall see to it that the people of Gobo's Taglur, who will of necessity have to surrender their lives to me, will not have given them in vain. The new generation will not include mortal enemies. The new world will be built on universal love and concord.]]></string>
<string id="510203"><![CDATA[Damn... So that's how you talk now. Doesn't sound like your own words, though.]]></string>
<string id="510204"><![CDATA[Yes. We'll exterminate all those who try to play the antagonism of Day and Night, or of Reason and the Earth, to their own advantage. We'll exterminate those who've made the Olgimsky and Kain clans the banners of this war. We'll exterminate those who've used the powers of the Dream Mistresses and the will of the heads of houses to fan the flames of this meaningless strife.]]></string>
<string id="510205"><![CDATA[So how are you going to… cleanse away the filth?]]></string>
<string id="510206"><![CDATA[They'll exterminate themselves. Everyone is at risk now, and death will more than once raise its scythe over many, and these days death is bound to raise its scythe above every link of the taglur. But since we foresee these moments, we'll mercifully save many from this terrible reaping.]]></string>
<string id="510207"><![CDATA[…With your permission, I'll now leave. ]]></string>
<string id="510208"><![CDATA[Someone may have seen something... I believe you've made some useful acquaintances in the town's slums. Not to mention we have all manner of lowlife here; could they know something? Speak to my brother Victor. He is much better than me where the practical side of things is concerned.]]></string>
<string id="510209"><![CDATA[I'll let you know what I find.]]></string>
<string id="510212"><![CDATA[How can I help you? ]]></string>
<string id="510213"><![CDATA[Rubin's disappeared. His home has been infected and looted. Neither his body nor Simon's was there. Where could he have gone?]]></string>
<string id="510214"><![CDATA[I don't know. I haven't seen him. Do you suspect that Rubin is dead?]]></string>
<string id="510222"><![CDATA[How would you explain the absence of the body? ]]></string>
<string id="510223"><![CDATA[It appears that once the infection began to spread across the house, master Rubin decided to remove the body. He must have taken it to some hidden location that he considered safe. However, since we still haven't heard from him, we can only infer that Rubin is dead.]]></string>
<string id="510224"><![CDATA[The body was stolen, perhaps? ]]></string>
<string id="510225"><![CDATA[I know for a fact that Rubin is alive and has the body.]]></string>
<string id="510226"><![CDATA[What do you mean by that? ]]></string>
<string id="510227"><![CDATA[He works in one of the abandoned Warehouses, but he hasn't finished examining the body yet.]]></string>
<string id="510228"><![CDATA[I'm sure he'll let you know of his whereabouts any moment now, and you'll take your brother's body to the Cathedral with due honours. ]]></string>
<string id="510231"><![CDATA[I don't have time for this now.]]></string>
<string id="510232"><![CDATA[Something tells me that isn't going to happen.]]></string>
<string id="510233"><![CDATA[Were you going to ask me for help? ]]></string>
<string id="510234"><![CDATA[I don't know anything about that, I'm afraid.]]></string>
<string id="510235"><![CDATA[Every hour brings us more trouble... ]]></string>
<string id="510236"><![CDATA[I'm looking for your brother's body, Victor. Do you have any ideas on the subject?]]></string>
<string id="510237"><![CDATA[Do you know anything regarding Rubin's whereabouts? ]]></string>
<string id="510238"><![CDATA[I do. If I were you, Olgimsky's son would be the first person I'd turn to. Young Vlad, nicknamed Charon. Rubin and he have had some business together. He knows places where Rubin may have taken the body.]]></string>
<string id="510239"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="510240"><![CDATA[He is suspected of murdering his own father. Accounts of the bloody events of two days ago include a man whose description he matches. And I wouldn't rule out his involvement in what happened at Rubin's house.]]></string>
<string id="510242"><![CDATA[Her—and no one else? ]]></string>
<string id="510243"><![CDATA[There's also Burakh, hiding somewhere in the town. The younger one, of course.]]></string>
<string id="510244"><![CDATA[That savage... ]]></string>
<string id="510245"><![CDATA[Is he hiding? ]]></string>
<string id="510246"><![CDATA[Have you already asked him? ]]></string>
<string id="510247"><![CDATA[I've tried. But we are in a difficult position now. On the one hand, we are putting pressure on his father; on the other, we're asking him for a favour... ]]></string>
<string id="510248"><![CDATA[Putting pressure? I was under the impression yesterday that we had managed to put an end to all disputes between the ruling families.]]></string>
<string id="510249"><![CDATA[There can never be an end to disputes between our families; it's as impossible as reuniting day with night. But now I feel that Big Vlad's actions have a bearing on the root of all our troubles. I don't like this silence from the Termitary! Could it be there that the infamous murderer is hiding?]]></string>
<string id="510250"><![CDATA[Your brother succumbed to the disease. I thought we'd already come to terms with that.]]></string>
<string id="510251"><![CDATA[A stranger has made their way into the town. Human or shabnak, it doesn't matter. We can't establish whether their involvement in Simon's death was direct or indirect, but the involvement is clearly there.]]></string>
<string id="510252"><![CDATA[All right. I'll try to ask Vlad the Younger.]]></string>
<string id="510253"><![CDATA[I'll talk to him. ]]></string>
<string id="510256"><![CDATA[The thought has crossed my mind too. The Termitary riot coincided suspiciously with Isidor's return from the Steppe and the outbreak of the epidemic.]]></string>
<string id="510257"><![CDATA[Vlad the Younger is a loyal son. He may be cynical, but deep inside he believes in the precepts of vassal ethics. He has no reason to conceal a crime—but he'd never help us knowing that we're acting against his father's best interests. Notwithstanding our respect for each other.]]></string>
<string id="510258"><![CDATA[Why did he deny you help?]]></string>
<string id="510259"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="510260"><![CDATA[It has been revealed to Maria in a dream that the cause of Simon's death is hiding at the Termitary. I intend to find out why Big Vlad refuses so adamantly to open it. And you should ask Vlad the Younger if you get the chance!]]></string>
<string id="510261"><![CDATA[Perhaps I won't even need to.]]></string>
<string id="510262"><![CDATA[I respect such adherence to principles too. ]]></string>
<string id="510263"><![CDATA[Tell everyone in your household to remain indoors. If anyone had to be sent outside, don't let them back in.]]></string>
<string id="510264"><![CDATA[What, abandoning them in the middle of the perilous night? ]]></string>
<string id="510265"><![CDATA[No. Such people will have to go to the isolation ward first. Saburov promised me that the ward will be set up soon. ]]></string>
<string id="510266"><![CDATA[I come bearing news from the Olgimskys. It has to do with the Termitary. ]]></string>
<string id="510267"><![CDATA[Ingenious. Damn it! All right... So be it. If that's how he's spinning it, then I'm forced to leave him alone. For now! You can tell him that. It will only last until we find proof that not everything is in order inside the Termitary!]]></string>
<string id="510268"><![CDATA[I hope there's no doubt in your mind that I am obviously only doing all this to get the Olgimskys to reveal the location of Simon's body to me.]]></string>
<string id="510269"><![CDATA[I haven't been wasting my time either in the meantime. The information my couriers have brought back is terrible: there's a ripper in the town. Fragments of human bodies have been found. It's either a stranger who doesn't observe our traditions, or... it really is someone or something sent by the Steppe.]]></string>
<string id="510270"><![CDATA[Perhaps you might order your son to open the Polyhedron so that Olgimsky's agents could inspect it? That will give us the right to inspect the Termitary.]]></string>
<string id="510271"><![CDATA[My son has long ceased obeying me. He regards me as an enemy. Only Nina had an influence on him. His beloved sister was someone he might have trusted, but now even Maria can't make him open the Polyhedron. And I wouldn't take the risk either. Let the children remain fortified.]]></string>
<string id="510272"><![CDATA[I'd like to make sure that your confidence is not groundless.]]></string>
<string id="510273"><![CDATA[I don't believe in Steppe monsters. Who could need dead bodies? ]]></string>
<string id="510274"><![CDATA[Since the dawn of time, the beliefs of the peoples of the Steppe have forbidden them to dissect their dead. They who penetrate the mysteries of anatomy, penetrate the mysteries of creation. That is taboo. In these troubled times, a demon has come who broke it. The destruction of a body will put the Earth in pain.]]></string>
<string id="510275"><![CDATA[Who is this stranger? ]]></string>
<string id="510276"><![CDATA[Earlier, I feared that Big Vlad was sheltering him at the Termitary. It's clear now that that isn't the case. He is on the loose. I think he is the thief. Also I believe that he's the very man who's been accused of patricide. The cursed, wayward son of Isidor Burakh! ]]></string>
<string id="510277"><![CDATA[What makes you think it's him?]]></string>
<string id="510278"><![CDATA[I haven't made up my mind yet. I just have my suspicions. The end times are upon us if sons have ceased to honour their fathers. They are turning the earth towards the void. Toppling what their parents built is what these wayward children are best at—but they never create anything in its place!]]></string>
<string id="510279"><![CDATA[I feel you're talking about your own son... ]]></string>
<string id="510280"><![CDATA[You are entitled to your opinion.]]></string>
<string id="510281"><![CDATA[How do we find this person? ]]></string>
<string id="510302"><![CDATA[There are some very peculiar attitudes about the dead in your town…]]></string>
<string id="510303"><![CDATA[Yes. They are derived from pagan superstition. The body is considered to be the sum of all truths; the ligaments keeping it whole—to be the ligaments of the universe. It must not be taken apart without the knowledge of how those dissection cuts will reverberate in the makeup of the universe.]]></string>
<string id="510304"><![CDATA[And you share in that superstition?]]></string>
<string id="510305"><![CDATA[I do.]]></string>
<string id="510306"><![CDATA[Why should I suspect that?]]></string>
<string id="510307"><![CDATA[If Rubin were alive, he would undoubtedly make his whereabouts known. And he certainly wouldn't keep quiet about the pest getting inside the town. He's one of the few who have an actual understanding of what that entails.]]></string>
<string id="510308"><![CDATA[Well, if neither Rubin nor Simon were in the dead house, that means Rubin has at least attempted to move the Keeper's body to another place. Otherwise we would have to surmise that someone has stolen two infected bodies with peculiarly obscure purposes. Wouldn't you agree?]]></string>
<string id="510309"><![CDATA[You're reading my mind.]]></string>
<string id="510310"><![CDATA[There are several locations where Rubin could have taken the corpse. But I have no plans to reveal them to you until you do our family a favour in return.]]></string>
<string id="510311"><![CDATA[So, what is that other place? ]]></string>
<string id="510312"><![CDATA[Gladly—unless it takes up too much of my time.]]></string>
<string id="510313"><![CDATA[I find it hard to believe that the body's been stolen. No madman could ransom it to the Kains and get away alive, and you could never find the kind of blasphemer who would defile it out of sheer malice. Rubin will make himself known soon, you'll see.]]></string>
<string id="510314"><![CDATA[Look… Rubin's dealings with our family are… our family's business. We value his trust. I don't feel that disclosing the details to you would be the right thing to do—not unless I see that... hmmm… the family would benefit more than it would suffer from that exchange. Do you understand?]]></string>
<string id="510315"><![CDATA[And still I beg for your assistance. There is no doubt in my mind that you have a theory of your own.]]></string>
<string id="510317"><![CDATA[In all honesty, I don't.]]></string>
<string id="510323"><![CDATA[I do.]]></string>
<string id="510334"><![CDATA[I managed to settle the matter. Victor will no longer insist on inspecting the Termitary.]]></string>
<string id="510335"><![CDATA[I'll keep my word—honouring the venerable Simon's remains is our mutual goal. We are bound by the same grief. There's a ripper—perhaps even more than one—on the loose in the Knots. I think they're runaway butchers.]]></string>
<string id="510336"><![CDATA[Runaway butchers? ]]></string>
<string id="510337"><![CDATA[Why would they dissect bodies?]]></string>
<string id="510338"><![CDATA[Well, let's just say they use the innards for fortune-telling. The times are difficult; I think their desire to tell what fortunes the future may have in store for them is perfectly understandable.]]></string>
<string id="510339"><![CDATA[...Or those few who were unlucky enough to find themselves outside when the Termitary was blocked off. Now they're hiding in the town. I believe they're stealing the dead to use their bodies for divination. They have their own future-telling techniques.]]></string>
<string id="510340"><![CDATA[Where could they be hiding?]]></string>
<string id="510341"><![CDATA[Where can I find them?]]></string>
<string id="510342"><![CDATA[To be honest, I'm not sure myself… One curious young man managed to trace their path. It seems they have been carrying the dead to the Spleen district. I'll mark the house on your map.]]></string>
<string id="510343"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="510344"><![CDATA[If they resist, am I allowed to kill them? ]]></string>
<string id="510345"><![CDATA[Not only kill, but take whatever possessions of theirs you may find in that house. Body snatchers are no longer protected by law, even if they happen to be butchers.]]></string>
<string id="510346"><![CDATA[Very well.]]></string>
<string id="510375"><![CDATA[Have you heard anything about the ripper? ]]></string>
<string id="510377"><![CDATA[Yes... I've heard the rumours. Several bodies missing from the cemetery... Nevertheless, you must realize a single person couldn't have done it. There must be several people. One man just couldn't appear in several places at once over such a short night... but you'll have a chance to see that for yourself soon.]]></string>
<string id="510378"><![CDATA[Could it have been young Burakh? ]]></string>
<string id="510379"><![CDATA[Whom do you suspect then? ]]></string>
<string id="510380"><![CDATA[The butchers, of course... It's a no-brainer. Even the sickest bastard wouldn't commit... a blasphemy like this. Some people are shameless enough to use a knife... But no one, except for butchers, would steal bodies... It's dangerous and pointless to boot.]]></string>
<string id="510381"><![CDATA[Pray forgive me... No, it couldn't have been him. All this time young Burakh's mind was busy with one thing only... Isidor's death and his inheritance. He had no time for corpses, believe me... Besides, Burakh is a Steppe person, even though he was brought up elsewhere... He honours the rite. ]]></string>
<string id="510382"><![CDATA[Fine. I believe you. ]]></string>
<string id="510383"><![CDATA[Fine. I believe you. ]]></string>
<string id="510400"><![CDATA[And what do you see? ]]></string>
<string id="510401"><![CDATA[Maria! I need to get into the Polyhedron. ]]></string>
<string id="510402"><![CDATA[You cannot. It is off limits. Especially to you, since you tend to plunge into the thick of the battle. Who knows what you might bring back on your coat... Yes, en-Daniil! I admire your courage. If the impression you've made on me is not fallacious, then you belong to the kind of people that the world is running out of.]]></string>
<string id="510403"><![CDATA[Tell me, what's inside it?]]></string>
<string id="510404"><![CDATA[Children playing, Bachelor Dankovsky. Fifteen hundred children. It is their princedom, and my little brother Kaspar, styled Khan, is their uncrowned prince. That place is clean. No evil can enter those walls; it would bounce off them like sunrays… I can see it.]]></string>
<string id="510405"><![CDATA[Aren't you afraid that the infection may have found its way inside?]]></string>
<string id="510406"><![CDATA[Never! Upon my word of honour, rest assured that no evil can ever make its way in there.]]></string>
<string id="510407"><![CDATA[How can you be so sure? ]]></string>
<string id="510408"><![CDATA[Not an hour goes by without me shuddering at the thought of that omnipresent evil creeping into the specular fortress of the Polyhedron. But I am watching the situation there closely. Trusting neither my gift nor my intuition, I get hourly updates from Khan.]]></string>
<string id="510409"><![CDATA[Simon's Focus also appeared to be impregnable to any visitors. That didn't save him though.]]></string>
<string id="510410"><![CDATA[Simon was killed by Isidor. I realize that with great clarity now. Simon himself had brought his murderer along into Focus.]]></string>
<string id="510411"><![CDATA[I'd like to talk to your brother.]]></string>
<string id="510412"><![CDATA[And yet?]]></string>
<string id="510413"><![CDATA[All right. Climb the Tower. Khan will confirm that I am right. ]]></string>
<string id="510414"><![CDATA[And your father—is he also completely positive there's not a single sick person inside the Polyhedron?]]></string>
<string id="510415"><![CDATA[Yes. Any one of us—my father, my uncle, or my brother—would swear to you upon their honour and their earthly purpose.]]></string>
<string id="510416"><![CDATA[I appreciate your trust. I won't let you down.]]></string>
<string id="510417"><![CDATA[All right, I believe you. And so from today on, I will vouch for the truthfulness of your words on my own honour.]]></string>
<string id="510418"><![CDATA[My feats are much humbler than they may appear. Tell me, is it possible that the infection has already struck at those who are hiding in the tower across the river?]]></string>
<string id="510419"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="510420"><![CDATA[You wanted to speak to me. I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="510421"><![CDATA[I need to examine this structure. ]]></string>
<string id="510422"><![CDATA[No, guest. That is impossible. We don't trust grown-ups. We can't allow the corruption to get inside. That's why we risk our lives guarding this place. Perhaps the pains we're taking will be convincing enough proof for you.]]></string>
<string id="510423"><![CDATA[Who are you guarding your tower from? ]]></string>
<string id="510424"><![CDATA[You. Your doppelgangers. Everyone who comes from across the river. ]]></string>
<string id="510425"><![CDATA[I don't have any doppelgangers.]]></string>
<string id="510426"><![CDATA[You do. Two of them. Also endeavouring to save humanity. At least that's what they say; every word they utter mirrors yours. And so far, they've caused nothing but harm.]]></string>
<string id="510427"><![CDATA[What kind of harm? ]]></string>
<string id="510428"><![CDATA[Our salvation lies in repose and silence. Our town must stay still now. Freeze, like someone who's stirred up a nest of venomous snakes. Then the disease will abate and burn up in its own flames. I was told these were your words. Were they? ]]></string>
<string id="510429"><![CDATA[Close enough. But what do my, ahem, "doppelgangers" have to do with anything?]]></string>
<string id="510430"><![CDATA[More like my thoughts, really.]]></string>
<string id="510431"><![CDATA[They make people uneasy. It's because of them that no one stays put. Disturbed by the Haruspex's actions and the Changeling's barmy preaching, people start fussing and end up laying their lives upon the altar of the common good. We children will not listen to you.]]></string>
<string id="510432"><![CDATA[Not a good idea.]]></string>
<string id="510433"><![CDATA[Why? What did I do to lose the trust of children?]]></string>
<string id="510434"><![CDATA[I'm protecting our world. We were doing just fine without you. We can handle this plague even if it spells the end of the world. Did you want to check that this place is clean? Have a look around. It is clean. I promise you. But I won't let you in, wise Bachelor. No offence.]]></string>
<string id="510435"><![CDATA[Are you sure? ]]></string>
<string id="510436"><![CDATA[You may mean well, but you bring evil and destruction all the same. This town is too fragile for your thudding steps.

<string id="510439"><![CDATA[I promise. I'll be happy to talk to you anytime here at the Agate Pit. And if something terrible happens inside, I'll be the first to shout for your help.]]></string>
<string id="510440"><![CDATA[That's reassuring.]]></string>
<string id="510441"><![CDATA[I'll mention what you said to Victor next time I talk to him.]]></string>
<string id="510442"><![CDATA[I've found the body snatchers. They were runaway butchers. ]]></string>
<string id="510443"><![CDATA[Did you find the body? ]]></string>
<string id="510444"><![CDATA[A body—dissected and disfigured. However, I find it hard to believe that it once belonged to your brother. I'll show you the building where I found it. ]]></string>
<string id="510445"><![CDATA[I will send my people there at once! You have my gratitude.]]></string>
<string id="510446"><![CDATA[Be cautious. ]]></string>
<string id="510447"><![CDATA[Georgiy is infuriated. Why didn't you inform him of where you took the body?]]></string>
<string id="510448"><![CDATA[If this is the case, consider me swayed to your side already. No matter what anyone may say.]]></string>
<string id="510449"><![CDATA[What about you? Do you possess this kind of privilege?]]></string>
<string id="510450"><![CDATA[Hard to say... my Master was planning to "bind me with the blood of his kin". In other words, I was to become his foster son. He never got to complete the procedure. As a result, I am formally allowed to perform dissections—but few people know about it. Most of them still see me as a soldier, rather than a butcher.]]></string>
<string id="510451"><![CDATA[So you did military service?]]></string>
<string id="510452"><![CDATA[Not for long. I served in General Shoin's army until I was injured in the head by the Skerries. I was released soon thereafter.]]></string>
<string id="510453"><![CDATA[I hear you... But from what I can see, not everyone in the town belongs to the indigenous population?]]></string>
<string id="510454"><![CDATA[What are the menkhu?]]></string>
<string id="510455"><![CDATA[Translated loosely as "men who set apart the parts of a whole", the menkhu are the adepts of the Kin. Butchers, surgeons, prophets—any occupation that has to do with knowing the separate parts that comprise a whole...]]></string>
<string id="510456"><![CDATA[Fine, but I am definitely not a menkhu. So what am I supposed to do?]]></string>
<string id="510457"><![CDATA[How do you think the bacterium kills, Bachelor?]]></string>
<string id="510458"><![CDATA[It causes a massive contamination of the blood. In so doing it overloads the cardiac muscle. In all likelihood, the infected suffer a stroke. That is something we didn't know before! ]]></string>
<string id="510459"><![CDATA[So, in order to acquire the potent, living microbial culture, we will have to get our hands on a still beating heart? This is borderline absurd. ]]></string>
<string id="510460"><![CDATA[We can start to research your vaccine though. Don't you have that… unique source of yours?]]></string>
<string id="510461"><![CDATA[I do.]]></string>
<string id="510462"><![CDATA[In any case, our work must no longer be delayed. Not after the new hope today has brought.]]></string>
<string id="510463"><![CDATA[Could you please explain what exactly you are trying to say?]]></string>
<string id="510464"><![CDATA[Are you perhaps unwell? Your pupils are dilated…]]></string>
<string id="510465"><![CDATA[Why the big words? Or have I accidentally just overheard something not intended for my ears at all?]]></string>
<string id="510466"><![CDATA[I suggest you make up your mind... Simon's death untied the connections; people got loose like the stitches of a poorly-knitted sweater. You know of the three wills and the three ideas they adhere to… Someone will have to die, while another will live. Or will it be others? I suspect you will have a say in the matter... Bachelor Dankovsky.]]></string>
<string id="510467"><![CDATA[I refuse to become anyone's death. ]]></string>
<string id="510468"><![CDATA[I don't believe your nonsense!]]></string>
<string id="510469"><![CDATA[She will hardly have the time to do much evil. ]]></string>
<string id="510470"><![CDATA[I don't want to play these games, Katerina. I am a scientist and an emissary of the Powers That Be. Spare me your leapfrog.]]></string>
<string id="510471"><![CDATA[What I've just heard is enough for me. ]]></string>
<string id="510472"><![CDATA[You need to have some sleep, Katerina. You have a fever. ]]></string>
<string id="510473"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="510476"><![CDATA[As you undoubtedly remember, our first attempt at making a vaccine involved a microbe that was already dead. To this, the organism produced almost no immune reaction. In our second attempt we had a... weakened microbe to experiment with. Weakened by... well, you know how. The third vaccine, then, should be made on the basis of a living specimen!]]></string>
<string id="510477"><![CDATA[The bacterium dies when extracted from a life-sustaining environment. Do we need to collect a portion of infected blood from someone who is still alive?]]></string>
<string id="510478"><![CDATA[Something along those lines... Brace yourself, Bachelor. We need a human heart. A heart that is still alive and beating! This is the meat that will make our curative broth.]]></string>
<string id="510479"><![CDATA[Do you suggest we bring someone here to slaughter them where they stand?]]></string>
<string id="510480"><![CDATA[That won't do... The infection must have progressed to an irreversibly critical state. Whoever carries it would be in agony by the time. We don't have to cut the patient up right here, though. I believe we have about thirty minutes to bring the heart here from wherever it is obtained.]]></string>
<string id="510481"><![CDATA[Burakh was going to dissect the people while they're still alive?]]></string>
<string id="510482"><![CDATA[I'd like you to know that he is set to achieve a rather noble feat. He wants to duplicate his father's success. While we are busy trying to protect the healthy, he wants to make a concoction that will enable him to cure the sick. He calls it a "panacea". Reportedly, he's made quite a bit of progress on it.]]></string>
<string id="510483"><![CDATA[I'll try to find Burakh.]]></string>
<string id="510484"><![CDATA[Please do! This is by far the best bet. I guess the Olgimskys would know where their protégé may be found. But, if you're unable to get ahold of him soon enough...]]></string>
<string id="510485"><![CDATA[Very well, you can count on me. However effective the vaccine proves to be, we have to try.]]></string>
<string id="510486"><![CDATA[Blood again... I'm so sick of all this blood. The very earth here is seeping with it... for all the good it does.]]></string>
<string id="510487"><![CDATA[If it doesn't, then we will do good, colleague! The vaccine is almost complete! You seem to underestimate our achievements; I'm actually a bit hurt. Forget about blood, focus on what lives within its cells. A Sand Pest microbe—that is our ultimate goal!]]></string>
<string id="510488"><![CDATA[You're right. Wait here for me.]]></string>
<string id="510489"><![CDATA[What am I supposed to do if Burakh refuses to help?]]></string>
<string id="510490"><![CDATA[You'll have to keep an eye on him then. If he's discovered, he will have to run for his life—serving as an effective decoy. No one will concern themselves with what remains of his... seance. Sneak up on a corpse he cut, grab the heart and bring it to me as soon as possible. The blood has to be warm.]]></string>
<string id="510491"><![CDATA[Well, what can I say... It does seem to be a unique opportunity.]]></string>
<string id="510492"><![CDATA[Still, this is… heinous. Keep in mind, I will not be cutting anyone myself. So let us hope I find Burakh soon.]]></string>
<string id="510494"><![CDATA[So he will have no reservations about cutting the heart out of a living person?!]]></string>
<string id="510500"><![CDATA[You are the only person I can count on.]]></string>
<string id="510501"><![CDATA[I must say, I'd be of more use to you here. You're making me do an errand boy's job.]]></string>
<string id="510502"><![CDATA[Who else can I turn to? As luck would have it, all my assistants are either dead or… not my assistants anymore. I was offered some help, I grant you, but it's clear that if I accepted, my self-proclaimed aids would have ended up dead. You know some of them, actually...]]></string>
<string id="510504"><![CDATA[You don’t say! I'd be damned if I allowed any of them to die in my place.]]></string>
<string id="510505"><![CDATA[These are hard times. We can't afford to refuse anyone's help.]]></string>
<string id="510506"><![CDATA[I'd make an exception for some of them, but that's just my personal opinion. But you, Bachelor! Are you not a professional?]]></string>
<string id="510507"><![CDATA[That I definitely am.]]></string>
<string id="510508"><![CDATA[Our opinions clearly differ. Don't worry though, no one will have to risk their life.]]></string>
<string id="510509"><![CDATA[I'm doing everything I can.]]></string>
<string id="510510"><![CDATA[This is it, doctor. It seems we have exactly what we need! We have brought the bacteria into the light; this writhing horned abomination... We can look at it now, and maybe even give it a name? You won't have to go to the Inquisitor empty-handed.]]></string>
<string id="510511"><![CDATA[So the last iteration was different from the previous ones?]]></string>
<string id="510512"><![CDATA[The vaccine will be ready by tomorrow morning. Where did you get the specimen?]]></string>
<string id="510513"><![CDATA[Burakh gave it to me.]]></string>
<string id="510514"><![CDATA[That blood is unusual. Did you ask him how he came across it?]]></string>
<string id="510515"><![CDATA[I didn't have a chance to.]]></string>
<string id="510516"><![CDATA[Oh! You know, Bachelor, it's strange... I think I've learned to tell the character of a person by their blood specimen. Here's the blood of an egotist; this one belonged to a poet... The owner of this blood was exhausted, and whoever gave that specimen was destined to become a great person... Well. This blood is extraordinary.]]></string>
<string id="510517"><![CDATA[It's better than nothing.]]></string>
<string id="510518"><![CDATA[I'll pick up the samples tomorrow and test them personally.]]></string>
<string id="510519"><![CDATA[What matters is that you make the vaccine. I'll be back tomorrow morning.]]></string>
<string id="510520"><![CDATA[Eh... The heart belonged to a young dancer; possibly a prostitute.]]></string>
<string id="510521"><![CDATA[Let us name it after the Inquisitor himself. I cannot escape the feeling he will be a bigger problem than the disease.]]></string>
<string id="510542"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="510543"><![CDATA[And so we finally meet, oynon. Just a pair of pawns on this dreadful chessboard where each square is blacker than black itself. Are we friends or are we foes? Will one consume the other—or will we part, each striving for his own victory?]]></string>
<string id="510544"><![CDATA[How can we be foes if we're fighting a common enemy?]]></string>
<string id="510545"><![CDATA[I'm glad to hear you say that, oynon. It's a shame we aren't standing together. I lack your knowledge. I'm blindfolded and can only follow my heart and my intuition. Here's a piece of advice for you: don't trust those who volunteer to be your guides on the path to victory. But the real battle is still ahead of us both.]]></string>
<string id="510546"><![CDATA[You mean the battle against the pest?]]></string>
<string id="510547"><![CDATA[I mean the battle against you. We may not be foes, but I have a strong feeling that we will end up opposing each other. Each of us will try to tilt the balance to his own advantage. ]]></string>
<string id="510548"><![CDATA[It's too early to tell.]]></string>
<string id="510549"><![CDATA[I don't know what you're talking about… although I can probably guess. Whatever the outcome, I will remain true to my conscience.]]></string>
<string id="510550"><![CDATA[If you're allowed to. My freedom has already been taken away from me. Do learn from my mistakes.]]></string>
<string id="510551"><![CDATA[I will.]]></string>
<string id="510552"><![CDATA[And how in the world did that happen?]]></string>
<string id="510553"><![CDATA[We'll be parting as friends. Hopefully we'll meet as friends next time too.]]></string>
<string id="510554"><![CDATA[That will depend on which side you choose when the time comes to decide who lives and who dies.]]></string>
<string id="510555"><![CDATA[We'll see about that.]]></string>
<string id="510556"><![CDATA[Goodbye, Artemy Burakh.]]></string>
<string id="510557"><![CDATA[I know. I have my own issues with the Powers That Be.]]></string>
<string id="510558"><![CDATA[I hope you aren't going to sacrifice our town to settle your issues.]]></string>
<string id="510559"><![CDATA[I will do what I must.]]></string>
<string id="510560"><![CDATA[I'm really not in the habit of rejecting an extended hand. But why do I constantly hear that you're getting in my way, jeopardizing the people I am trying to save?]]></string>
<string id="510561"><![CDATA[That is true, I will drown it in blood. It's been foretold. You know that I come from a Steppe kin. We value the words that tell the future of a Warden. Some people I kill—in order to save others. That is all I can say in my defence.]]></string>
<string id="510562"><![CDATA[I have nothing but respect for you, but we're unlikely to get along. In you, I see myself. I see the hands of your fate hold you by the shoulder. You are a pawn; I am a player.]]></string>
<string id="510563"><![CDATA[We'll see which of us is a pawn in the end. You can't just call yourself a player; you have to deserve this right. Farewell, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="510564"><![CDATA[Wait a minute. I need your help.]]></string>
<string id="510565"><![CDATA[We'll meet again.]]></string>
<string id="510566"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, Burakh, but I'm not a pawn.]]></string>
<string id="510567"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="510591"><![CDATA[Bless your wits and wisdom, doctor Dankovsky! ]]></string>
<string id="510592"><![CDATA[What's the happy occasion?]]></string>
<string id="510593"><![CDATA[You've provided people with a shelter. Everyone's gathering at the Cathedral… it's a Cathed-real Cathed-rally. Three hundred and fifty people have already agreed to come over from infected districts.]]></string>
<string id="510594"><![CDATA[Oh really?]]></string>
<string id="510595"><![CDATA[Bachelor, the credit for all the lives saved today is yours. You've made a very wise choice.]]></string>
<string id="510596"><![CDATA[My choices are always wise, young man.]]></string>
<string id="510597"><![CDATA[Come now… No need to blow it out of proportion.]]></string>
<string id="510598"><![CDATA[I hope they see for themselves how rational the solution is.]]></string>
<string id="510599"><![CDATA[Please spare me your flattery. It doesn't sit well with me.]]></string>
<string id="510600"><![CDATA[Get stuffed!]]></string>
<string id="510633"><![CDATA[Yes. ]]></string>
<string id="510634"><![CDATA[So what course of action do you intend to take?]]></string>
<string id="510635"><![CDATA[I have considerations of my own. ]]></string>
<string id="510636"><![CDATA[And the thing is, Katerina sensed her inhumanity! But still we approached her as if we knew nothing of her secret. I trusted Clara. She seemed to me an emissary of some benevolent power, sent to assist us in disposing of this atrocious plague.]]></string>
<string id="510637"><![CDATA[And now you don't trust her?]]></string>
<string id="510638"><![CDATA[Supernatural powers do not distinguish between black and white. They do not share human views on good and evil. To the human eye, the border that separates earthly evil from earthly good is thin, thin and broken! That ancient logic is beyond our understanding.]]></string>
<string id="510639"><![CDATA[If Clara is guilty, you are the most guilty of them all. Your spouse is quite skilled in seeing what's hidden. If you knew her from the start to be a messenger of the Steppe... ]]></string>
<string id="510640"><![CDATA[I personally entrusted this girl with checking the suspicious. One thing I know firmly—she is absolutely assured that she is doing good. She only tried sincerely. I do not know what creature hides beneath her skin and what it brings into the world… But Clara knows even less. She thinks herself a saviour.]]></string>
<string id="510641"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor will listen to these arguments, but will not consider them when he sends you to the gallows. If you knew that the cause of our misfortune may be hiding inside Clara, you'll have to bear responsibility.]]></string>
<string id="510642"><![CDATA[This again, the reasoning of prehistoric hunters… Fine, have it your way. I 'll study her blood. Where does one find her these days?]]></string>
<string id="510643"><![CDATA[Where it is most dangerous now… Whoever she is, she still believes that she is here on a holy quest to improve the order of things and help the doomed. Of that there is no doubt.]]></string>
<string id="510644"><![CDATA[It very well may be so.]]></string>
<string id="510645"><![CDATA[I'll talk about this with Katerina.]]></string>
<string id="510646"><![CDATA[The search for the carrier never stopped since day one. All suspects were cleared by you. How do you explain this?]]></string>
<string id="510647"><![CDATA[You are remarkably quick to demote your adopted daughter from angel to demon.]]></string>
<string id="510648"><![CDATA[There are no angels and no demons in the Steppe, Bachelor. Only spawns of the Earth-that-Bears and the Earth-that-Consumes. These entities have a different nature. We call them spirits—but they are merely animated meat. They try to imitate humans, which only makes their forms even more gruesome.]]></string>
<string id="510649"><![CDATA[So you assume Clara to be a malevolent spirit posing as a kind one to mislead you?]]></string>
<string id="510650"><![CDATA[You gave her tasks. Don't try to deny it—I know. And now you think a Sand Plague carrier has been running your errands. I reckon this is a fact worthy of Inquisitor Orff's attention.    ]]></string>
<string id="510651"><![CDATA[Hermann Orff was dispatched here? That is dreadful… How do you know? ]]></string>
<string id="510652"><![CDATA[Orff, Mann, or Karminsky. Each has drills for eyes, razors for hands, and a mechanical numerator for a heart.]]></string>
<string id="510653"><![CDATA[I do not fear the Inquisitor, Bachelor. I am well accustomed to answering for my actions. I am treating Clara with proper awe. Unlike you, I am counting on the veracity of the local tradition. It is my duty to burn the source of the plague, even if it turns out to be Clara. If you won't help me to determine the carrier precisely, I'll have to burn all the suspects.   ]]></string>
<string id="510654"><![CDATA[Don't worry. I will study their blood. ]]></string>
<string id="510655"><![CDATA[Why burn? Isolate. Come to think of it, most townsfolk of note are already under lock and key credit to my efforts.]]></string>
<string id="510656"><![CDATA[Last night showed that isolation solves nothing. ]]></string>
<string id="510657"><![CDATA[More lunacy…]]></string>
<string id="510658"><![CDATA[Last night once again showed the authorities to be impotent. ]]></string>
<string id="510659"><![CDATA[No matter. Consider this, Saburov—the noose around your neck is tightening. The only question that remains is who will knock the stool from under you.]]></string>
<string id="510660"><![CDATA[I heard she treats Katerina and you almost like parents. Is that true? ]]></string>
<string id="510661"><![CDATA[You are responsible for what she has been doing. Hence I'd like to hear your recommendation. What am I to do with your protégé? ]]></string>
<string id="510662"><![CDATA[Katerina and I made it clear we deem her a gift from above. Katerina was even ready to adopt her. There was something that confused us, however...]]></string>
<string id="510663"><![CDATA[What?]]></string>
<string id="510664"><![CDATA[Her strange disappearances and the odd consequences of her actions, I presume?]]></string>
<string id="510665"><![CDATA[No. ]]></string>
<string id="510666"><![CDATA[Yesterday some unknown creature entered the locked Cathedral where several hundred healthy people found shelter from the epidemy. Witnesses say she walked among the sleeping and spread some sort of liquid upon their lips. Then she ran out through the gates. 
]]></string>
<string id="510668"><![CDATA[Any suspects? ]]></string>
<string id="510669"><![CDATA[There was a panic inside. The doors, however, were guarded just as you ordered. Feeling trouble, the guards locked the gates until hospital attendants arrived. When the gates was opened, few of this enormous crowd still could as much as move their tongue. Those we managed to question identified the carrier.]]></string>
<string id="510670"><![CDATA[I was told they identified a young lady, one well-known here. One of those especially beloved by the townsfolk. So no one said her name.  ]]></string>
<string id="510676"><![CDATA[So, Bachelor, I have some news for you: the bad and… well, you know. All news is bad these days.]]></string>
<string id="510678"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor whom the Powers That Be have sent to resolve our… erm... supposedly hopeless situation is Karminskiy the hanging judge. The man whose lips and nails are always wet with blood. You know him better than I do though. ]]></string>
<string id="510679"><![CDATA[What is the good news then? Or was that it?]]></string>
<string id="510680"><![CDATA[That was the bad one. Here's the good news: he is willing to respect your decision. Find the carrier for him, and Karminskiy will declare you the person who has done his job.]]></string>
<string id="510681"><![CDATA[Sounds tempting... ]]></string>
<string id="510682"><![CDATA[Well... As of now, he's in good graces of the Powers That Be, so he can afford to do that. And besides, as you are probably well aware, the inquisitors have a very strict internal code of honour. They'd never conceal the truth; that would equal death to them.]]></string>
<string id="510683"><![CDATA[I know that.]]></string>
<string id="510684"><![CDATA[Thanks for the news. ]]></string>
<string id="510685"><![CDATA[Oh, really? As far as I know, an inquisitor would never pass an opportunity to put another victory on their record. Сompetition…]]></string>
<string id="510686"><![CDATA[I'm not even going to bother asking how you came to know this…]]></string>
<string id="510687"><![CDATA[I don't know him, and I don't ever want to. I'll have you know I've never drunk brotherhood with him.]]></string>
<string id="510688"><![CDATA[I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="510689"><![CDATA[Does he now? So these are the consequences of yesterday's conversation. A domino effect, no less. To what do I owe the pleasure of your company then? Did you come to see me as a friend? Or in your, shall we say, official capacity?]]></string>
<string id="510690"><![CDATA[Do you know what happened in the Cathedral? ]]></string>
<string id="510691"><![CDATA[Of course. A terrifying tragedy, but also a mere nuisance compared to the overall drama.]]></string>
<string id="510692"><![CDATA[Be honest with me: were you there? ]]></string>
<string id="510693"><![CDATA[I know they have found something that belongs to me in the Cathedral. Let us see: a white scarf made of silk, a set of silver earrings with tiny emeralds in them, a gold ring made in the shape of a squirrel biting its tail, a pair of suede mittens, and a twyrine flask adorned with a crude engraving of me. Is this all?]]></string>
<string id="510694"><![CDATA[They say that whoever it was in the Cathedral was offering people infected jewellery. Which they accepted, hoping to exchange it for food.]]></string>
<string id="510695"><![CDATA[They do say that, don't they. Though, I feel more amused by something else. The rumours of a semi-transparent witch are obvious nonsense. But then, how did it get into the Cathedral? You have inspected everything inside, did you not? The building was hardly prone to an intrusion like this. Not a single person died there in two days.]]></string>
<string id="510696"><![CDATA[Yes. The building was almost watertight.]]></string>
<string id="510697"><![CDATA[This Cathedral is damned, Daniil. Your project required a miracle to bear fruit, yet no miracle would ever happen within this empty shell of a temple. Everything that has transpired was to be expected. The Cathedral was breached because there was no possibility it wouldn't happen. These circumstances were ushered in by causes of a higher order.]]></string>
<string id="510698"><![CDATA[You might be right. I'm beginning to get used to your logic of concordance.]]></string>
<string id="510699"><![CDATA[Still, do show me your hand, please.]]></string>
<string id="510700"><![CDATA[I didn't examine it personally, but judging by the observations of those who did... ]]></string>
<string id="510701"><![CDATA[They say that in their death throes, people were tearing the jewellery from the… the lady guest… while she was covering them in her deadly kisses.]]></string>
<string id="510702"><![CDATA[How did your belongings find their way into the Cathedral, Yulia?]]></string>
<string id="510703"><![CDATA[I gave these trinkets to... someone whom I believe to be innocent. At least, this is what my calculations suggest. However, you have mentioned Saburov? This does not quite gel... Could it be a case of split personality?]]></string>
<string id="510704"><![CDATA[What are you talking about? Are you talking to yourself? This is a textbook symptom of mental disorder, you know... ]]></string>
<string id="510705"><![CDATA[I'd like you to promise me that the person in question will not suffer your anger. Instinctive anger, inconsiderate fury... these are no good advisors on the matter. This is a very complicated case, you see, no matter how tempting the most obvious conclusions may be...]]></string>
<string id="510706"><![CDATA[Yes. I give you my word of honour. ]]></string>
<string id="510707"><![CDATA[Her name is Clara. She is a little girl with quite a few peculiar thoughts to play with...]]></string>
<string id="510708"><![CDATA[Oh? A curious definition... I assume you know her well, and have had time to grow fond of her? They say she's a gifted hypnotist... ]]></string>
<string id="510709"><![CDATA[No. They say it was either you or Lara. ]]></string>
<string id="510710"><![CDATA[Tell me the name. At least I'll be able to ask this person a few questions. ]]></string>
<string id="510711"><![CDATA[If you repeat these words to the Inquisitor, it would hardly gain you his favour.]]></string>
<string id="510712"><![CDATA[Inquisitors are, first and foremost, intellectuals. Just like you or me, they crave to uncover the truth and reject personal symapathies and beliefs in favour of more feasible methods of investigation. Speaking of which, I'd rather not have anything in common with vultures like Orff or Karminsky.]]></string>
<string id="510713"><![CDATA[Let's hope it happens to be somebody else…]]></string>
<string id="510714"><![CDATA[Yes. Any of them would kill and torture people in numbers no less devastating than the Sand Plague itself.]]></string>
<string id="510715"><![CDATA[I've always been your friend, Yulia. What makes you ask something like this?]]></string>
<string id="510716"><![CDATA[I am on duty. I need to examine a sample of your blood. ]]></string>
<string id="510717"><![CDATA[Examine it all you like. I have nothing to be afraid of.]]></string>
<string id="510718"><![CDATA[Stretch out your hand, if you will...]]></string>
<string id="510719"><![CDATA[Something has just crossed my mind... I'd share it with you, if you think you will be able to keep your calm. After all, we're both reasonable people.]]></string>
<string id="510720"><![CDATA[I don't like where this is going.]]></string>
<string id="510721"><![CDATA[Does the Inquisitor need a scapegoat to appease him? Let him have it then! You must give me up to the Inquisitor, Daniil. This will not mean you have betrayed me insofar as I am asking it for myself.]]></string>
<string id="510722"><![CDATA[That's out of the question. ]]></string>
<string id="510723"><![CDATA[Don't be obtuse, Dankovsky; not when the victory is this close! Go back to the Capital. You have to finish what you have started. You must challenge death, even if you will have to fight it on a different field. You must avenge us! I know it is all over for us here, one way or another. Let the dead bury their dead.]]></string>
<string id="510724"><![CDATA[Do you think I'd just give up? That I would be tempted by the opportunity of an easy victory? In this case, you don't know me very well!]]></string>
<string id="510725"><![CDATA[Not really... Truth be told, I knew in advance what your answer would be. Still, it seemed worthwhile to try. Forgive my regrettable lack of tact.]]></string>
<string id="510726"><![CDATA[Come now. You're intoxicated by this wretched herb... Go sleep it off, Yulia. ]]></string>
<string id="510727"><![CDATA[Apology not accepted. I've changed my mind. I will report you to the Inquisitor. ]]></string>
<string id="510728"><![CDATA[In other words, instead of fighting to reveal the truth, you are suggesting that I flee with a bunch of useful lies… Yulia, I didn't even think you would offend me so greatly! ]]></string>
<string id="510729"><![CDATA[... Fine. I'll do it then. I hope that you will share with the Inquisitor the specific circumstances that you've refused to tell me about.]]></string>
<string id="510730"><![CDATA[You made the right choice, Bachelor Dankovsky. Don't thank me—I have my own reasons to believe that this is the most reliable way to uncover what is hidden. The Inquisitor and I have a lot to discuss with each other.]]></string>
<string id="510731"><![CDATA[Your decision will not be forgotten.]]></string>
<string id="510732"><![CDATA[I will also attend the interrogation. ]]></string>
<string id="510733"><![CDATA[How could you think that I would do something so low?]]></string>
<string id="510734"><![CDATA[But why? ]]></string>
<string id="510735"><![CDATA[Where do I start... Suffice it to say I am more guilty than you may suspect. Don't ask me to elaborate. Let the Inquisitor question me and I will explain the situation in great detail. I don't think I will be able to explain as much to you... ]]></string>
<string id="510736"><![CDATA[Go to bed, Yulia. I will pretend this conversation never happened. ]]></string>
<string id="510737"><![CDATA[What are you talking about? ]]></string>
<string id="510739"><![CDATA[I've mulled it over—and here's what I think. Hand me over to the Inquisitor. I'll have to talk to him anyway. You have every right to do that, don't you? And most importantly, you won't be making a mistake.]]></string>
<string id="510740"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="510741"><![CDATA[I've mulled it over—and, well… people must be right. The key to this mystery, the mystery of the disease, must have something to do with me. Even if I'm not the cause, I'll help the Inquisitor get to the bottom of all this. He'll find a way to extract the truth from me.]]></string>
<string id="510742"><![CDATA[On a rack... No. Not going to happen.]]></string>
<string id="510743"><![CDATA[Well, I never... Are inquisitors allowed to torture people?]]></string>
<string id="510744"><![CDATA[You didn't know that? You must have been born yesterday after all. ]]></string>
<string id="510745"><![CDATA[Whatever I do, I can't avoid meeting him. So why don't we just fix it so that it will be you turning me in? That'd be a great victory for you! Wouldn't it? Why are you frowning?]]></string>
<string id="510746"><![CDATA[I do not accept victories as gifts. You are free to go to the Inquisitor if you so desire, but only after I tell him of your innocence.]]></string>
<string id="510747"><![CDATA[And what would be the value of such victory? The real foe has not been identified yet. Or do you expect me to behave like they do? To engage in wishful thinking? Lie to everyone and to myself? Like those who are in charge of our fate and who I despise so much…? No. I refuse.]]></string>
<string id="510748"><![CDATA[No, I'm not frowning. I'm glad you've made the decision yourself, Clara. Perhaps you truly are a saint, like they say… You will go to the Inquisitor with me. Dixi. ]]></string>
<string id="510749"><![CDATA[You're a suspicious creature, Clara. Perhaps you're right, it would make sense for you to have a chat with the Inquisitor. But I won't be turning you in to him as culprit.]]></string>
<string id="510750"><![CDATA[Do as you see fit.]]></string>
<string id="510751"><![CDATA[Aren't you afraid? ]]></string>
<string id="510752"><![CDATA[I've already told you, you are not the witch. Is my word not good enough for you?]]></string>
<string id="510753"><![CDATA[Good day, Daniil. I'm not offended at all, you don't have to say anything! Do you need my hand? My arm?]]></string>
<string id="510754"><![CDATA[I wanted to talk to you first. Where were you last night? ]]></string>
<string id="510755"><![CDATA[I stayed in, just like you advised everyone to. I've found out about the Cathedral situation in my usual way, by listening to the shouting in the streets. And then my former milklady—she's still alive, can you imagine that?—knocked on my window and told me about my necklace...]]></string>
<string id="510756"><![CDATA[What necklace? ]]></string>
<string id="510757"><![CDATA[I had antique jewellery—it was very dear to me. And not just me: Stamatin offered me ten thousand for it—a fortune back then! Especially for an ordinary kamain-tree necklace with dark metal lacework… I don't really think it was worth that much, although the carving was magical.]]></string>
<string id="510758"><![CDATA[The beads from this necklace were found at the Cathedral… are you crying?]]></string>
<string id="510759"><![CDATA[The beads were in their mouths. These poor unfortunates were muttering that mara sprayed her tears over them; others said she kissed them; the rest claimed that she offered them water... People called these beads "Lara Ravel's tears". And now everyone will think it was my doing!]]></string>
<string id="510760"><![CDATA[l'll dissuade them.]]></string>
<string id="510761"><![CDATA[Check my blood first. It's only fair. At least you won't have any doubts that you're telling the truth then.]]></string>
<string id="510762"><![CDATA[Thank you, Lara.]]></string>
<string id="510763"><![CDATA[Just don't let it get to you, okay?]]></string>
<string id="510764"><![CDATA[They won't. Thinking is no longer a commodity everyone can afford, and the streets are full of crawling beasts.]]></string>
<string id="510765"><![CDATA[It's a pity it's gone.]]></string>
<string id="510766"><![CDATA[You're above suspicion, Lara. Don't you worry about a thing. ]]></string>
<string id="510773"><![CDATA[So there is no carrier? Then I must have been right… No one is to blame.]]></string>
<string id="510774"><![CDATA[I think I've made a mistake. I just don’t know where.]]></string>
<string id="510775"><![CDATA[I, on the other hand, think you've already won. You've done everything humanly possible. You will return to the Capital victorious.]]></string>
<string id="510776"><![CDATA[No way. Neither the Powers That Be nor their envoys recognize partial solutions.]]></string>
<string id="510777"><![CDATA[I made up my mind, Daniil. As soon as the Inquisitor arrives, I'll come before him and confess I was the carrier. He will believe me, since my words will be supported by Big Vlad… and the chorus of people who were prying my beads from the lips of the dead. Then I'll have to remain consistent, and that's all.]]></string>
<string id="510778"><![CDATA[What have I done to cause you so much grievance that you're suggesting this vility to me?]]></string>
<string id="510779"><![CDATA[But I really am a carrier, Bachelor. That'll become the truth. There's something you don't know. Don't try to dissuade me. You've designed the plan that would become everyone's salvation, but it's missing the cornerstone—the carrier's head. Am I right?]]></string>
<string id="510780"><![CDATA[The real carrier's head!]]></string>
<string id="510781"><![CDATA[You don't see the things for what they really are. Everything has a hidden meaning, a double agenda. You've solved the problem correctly... almost. But you're missing the main point, you've failed to match the two pictures together—the second picture painting me as the culprit. Just take it easy.]]></string>
<string id="510782"><![CDATA[No. You will not go to the Inquisitor. I forbid it!]]></string>
<string id="510784"><![CDATA[Well, Lara... The choice was yours. Make you confession tomorrow—and remember that you have my eternal gratitude. ]]></string>
<string id="510785"><![CDATA[The theory that the source equals the carrier has not been proven yet… It's merely a theory. An obvious one, but a theory still.]]></string>
<string id="510786"><![CDATA[…Why do you insist on being guilty?]]></string>
<string id="510787"><![CDATA[But why?]]></string>
<string id="510788"><![CDATA[Look out of the window. Does it look like a victory?]]></string>
<string id="510789"><![CDATA[This cannot be. ]]></string>
<string id="510790"><![CDATA[Seems like it… I was so close, yet I took a wrong turn somewhere.]]></string>
<string id="510791"><![CDATA[Who cares for my heart? No one can hear it beat under these rags… Even the children avoid me. They call me The Nail, get scared, and don't let me play with them. That's the right thing to do, of course… Children are smart, their guts never fail them.]]></string>
<string id="510792"><![CDATA[Wait, are you crying? ]]></string>
<string id="510793"><![CDATA[Stop mocking me, will you? Didn't you realize that it was me all along?]]></string>
<string id="510794"><![CDATA[…You were… what?]]></string>
<string id="510795"><![CDATA[Why the funny look? Me, it was me. The Sand Plague, the spirit of the Steppe. What, would you like me to bow? Kiss you on the forehead? That's enough… it's all fun and games—until… I'm tired, and I'm bored. Today I've finally sated my hunger… for the first time in forever.]]></string>
<string id="510796"><![CDATA[Wait... I don' believe you. ]]></string>
<string id="510797"><![CDATA[Oh, just don't pretend to have been clueless, okay? You knew all along—from the very beginning. I never even made an effort to hide anything from you... Well, even if you were really so gullible, the Inquisitor will be on to me in the blink of an eye. That's not the person to have dust thrown into their eyes... So that's enough. It's time to confess. ]]></string>
<string id="510798"><![CDATA[Stop it! Were you truly "a thing of the Steppe", you couldn't speak about Inquisitors so confidently. You're lying! Why?!]]></string>
<string id="510799"><![CDATA[Well... People say things... I only repeat what I've heard... Eh… So, was my confusion believable?]]></string>
<string id="510800"><![CDATA[You liar! And your manner of speech? The word choices? If not for these clothes, I would've assumed you were a girl from the Capital. What do you want?]]></string>
<string id="510801"><![CDATA[Hand me over to the Inquisitor, Dankovsky. It doesn't matter which of you two catches me, you or he. I'd rather it was you. You'll return to your home city triumphant, you'll win your laboratory back! Find yourself a place where people would truly appreciate the fruits of your victory—and live there! As for me, I don't want to live any longer anyway. I'm too tired...]]></string>
<string id="510803"><![CDATA[You're right. I don't know who you really are, but the Inquisitor will sort it out. Perhaps you are indeed the carrier.]]></string>
<string id="510804"><![CDATA[No. Won't happen. I got you—you want to cover for the real carrier… and that means you know who it is. That's all right, I'll pry the testimony from you… later.]]></string>
<string id="510805"><![CDATA[So you're the carrier? The maneater? The rag-wearing midget, the shabnak with nails under her skin? What else… the mara? The turnskin?]]></string>
<string id="510806"><![CDATA[And what do you suggest? ]]></string>
<string id="510807"><![CDATA[So the disease is you?]]></string>
<string id="510808"><![CDATA[Are you saying what I think you're saying?]]></string>
<string id="510810"><![CDATA[That's all right. Sooner or later you will find a man that will listen to your heart.]]></string>
<string id="510811"><![CDATA[Greetings, honourable doctor! Our job is almost done. Are you satisfied?]]></string>
<string id="510812"><![CDATA[It depends on how well you've done it.]]></string>
<string id="510813"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="510814"><![CDATA[A rough crowd… demands rough measures. I sincerely hope you wouldn't get it into your head that I'm enjoying this.]]></string>
<string id="510815"><![CDATA[How come there's no water in the town?]]></string>
<string id="510816"><![CDATA[The town's water supply's been sabotaged and ruined! To be more precise, we've lost the purifying system on the water intake that supplies water from the Gorkhon to people's homes.]]></string>
<string id="510817"><![CDATA[How did that happen?]]></string>
<string id="510818"><![CDATA[The local blockheads, egged on by some overly active taskmaster, destroyed the water supply to prevent infected water from getting into the town. Can you see it now? I'm telling you, the crowd is rough…]]></string>
<string id="510819"><![CDATA[Damn it… What shall we do now?]]></string>
<string id="510830"><![CDATA[What started the rumour that the infection is waterborne?]]></string>
<string id="510831"><![CDATA[Simple minds need no explanations; they need someone to cry wolf—and there you have it. Hysteria is the best justification for believing in any madness.]]></string>
<string id="510832"><![CDATA[Very well. Other than residential property, what other options are there?]]></string>
<string id="510833"><![CDATA[Are there any places supplied with water at all?]]></string>
<string id="510836"><![CDATA[My compliments, dear doctor…]]></string>
<string id="510837"><![CDATA[I'm done. The Cathedral will serve as an isolation ward; the Theatre has become a hospital; the morgue will be located in a remote warehouse. Here are the keys.]]></string>
<string id="510838"><![CDATA[You've given me a bloody world of trouble…]]></string>
<string id="510839"><![CDATA[Are you aware that the trouble your people went through proved to be absolutely in vain?]]></string>
<string id="510840"><![CDATA[Please do examine the Cathedral and the Theatre. Issue the appropriate orders. Bring me the keys. Then I'll be ready to confirm your findings and begin working on those places.]]></string>
<string id="510841"><![CDATA[I am so worried about dad…]]></string>
<string id="510842"><![CDATA[Victoria, what has your father been up to lately?]]></string>
<string id="510843"><![CDATA[Do you by any chance know where the dead are brought these days?]]></string>
<string id="510844"><![CDATA[Would you like me to reveal the secret of a miraculous remedy for the Sand Plague? It's dangerous, mind you.]]></string>
<string id="510845"><![CDATA[I'm all ears, Victoria. ]]></string>
<string id="510846"><![CDATA[Have you ever seen antique boxes with chalky or bluish powder inside? It has already fossilized in some of them. Have you already heard of the powders—dubbed "shmowders" sometimes?]]></string>
<string id="510847"><![CDATA[I haven't.]]></string>
<string id="510848"><![CDATA[I've heard bits and pieces.]]></string>
<string id="510849"><![CDATA[Tell me. I am eager to hear this story from someone as honest and reasonable as you appear to be.]]></string>
<string id="510850"><![CDATA[The powders are secret remedies that some people have been keeping since the First Outbreak. Before it all started, one boy—his name was Crowfoot, he died later—inspired the children to play epidemic. They were making these powders.]]></string>
<string id="510851"><![CDATA[What is the First Outbreak? ]]></string>
<string id="510852"><![CDATA[So?]]></string>
<string id="510853"><![CDATA[Wait a minute... Are you saying they used to play epidemic even before the First Outbreak? ]]></string>
<string id="510854"><![CDATA[Indeed... Whoa… I never thought about it like that! What a strange coincidence. Still, that's not important—we won't be able to learn anything from them anyway. The inventors of the game are now in heavens. That is not what I wanted to speak with you about.]]></string>
<string id="510855"><![CDATA[Then speak, Victoria. I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="510856"><![CDATA[Five years ago a terrible disease broke out and engulfed several houses in the Crude Sprawl. They burst into it in a blink of an eye, like dry paper would. Every single inhabitant was infected immediately. Almost all of them have died, except for several children—who were courageous enough to take the powders. ]]></string>
<string id="510857"><![CDATA[So what's so special about those powders?]]></string>
<string id="510858"><![CDATA[Some children stole various drugs for their game—they chose the prettiest ones, of course. Then they crushed the pills in a mortar, mixed them, and wrapped the mixtures into the fresh leaves of fragrant Steppe swevery "for safekeeping". ]]></string>
<string id="510859"><![CDATA[Are you implying this, ahem, mishmash can help with the Sand Plague? ]]></string>
<string id="510860"><![CDATA[Not always. Every child had a personal secret recipe. No one knows which particular drugs were used; each mixture was different. The most efficient ones were made by Beaker, Flanky, and Catchfly. Crowfoot's powders were also respected—because they were the prettiest.]]></string>
<string id="510861"><![CDATA[Where are these powders now? ]]></string>
<string id="510862"><![CDATA[This is ridiculous... Excuse me, young lady, but this is of no interest to me.]]></string>
<string id="510863"><![CDATA[All over the place. Some are stored in caches in the houses where the children used to play infirmary. The powders were lethally dangerous, you see—if anyone was to take that much drugs, it would damage their health horribly. But the children beg to differ, like they always do. "They helped once, so what if they do so again?" is the line of reasoning.]]></string>
<string id="510864"><![CDATA[And what do you think?]]></string>
<string id="510865"><![CDATA[Some of them undoubtedly help. They poison the body, true, but they also poison the Sand Dirt out. I have no idea how it works—perhaps there are antibiotics in the mixture. Others are indeed lethal. And every single one of them is extremely detrimental to your health.]]></string>
<string id="510866"><![CDATA[I have no doubts about that.]]></string>
<string id="510867"><![CDATA[The thing is, the kids were recently reminded of one of the caches. They've pried it open, and now they cannot wait to test the acquired powders in an infected district. Loafer, Beaker's younger brother, has already gone to do the testing, the fool! ]]></string>
<string id="510868"><![CDATA[Fine. I'll find the kid. ]]></string>
<string id="510869"><![CDATA[So they have a whole cache of these powders stocked there, huh?]]></string>
<string id="510870"><![CDATA[They have probably only taken a few, but they know the places... So they will continue getting more—and getting poisoned again and again. It's a lottery—no one can remember which powder is which, what the recipe was… It's a be cured or die situation.]]></string>
<string id="510871"><![CDATA[All right. We'll drag Loafer out of this. And perhaps I'll find a use for the powders too.]]></string>
<string id="510872"><![CDATA[No, young lady. Not today.]]></string>
<string id="510873"><![CDATA[All right, I'll find this Loafer—if it's not too late already, that is. Show me where he went.]]></string>
<string id="510874"><![CDATA[To the Skinners, the district that's already wholly infected... But I do not know his exact whereabouts! When I banned the tests, they started avoiding me. ]]></string>
<string id="510875"><![CDATA[Never mind. I'll find him. ]]></string>
<string id="510876"><![CDATA[I've found the boy. ]]></string>
<string id="510877"><![CDATA[Is everything all right with him? He's not sick, is he?]]></string>
<string id="510878"><![CDATA[He's not—he was lucky. I'll find the caches as soon as possible and retrieve the poison.]]></string>
<string id="510879"><![CDATA[Do you know of any other places?]]></string>
<string id="510880"><![CDATA[Mmm... The only thing I know is that the caches were mostly hidden in suburban houses… but these houses could long have been inhabited by the people coming from the Termitary. I also know that two caches were called the Mild Dew and the Dovecot, but I do not know the locations. Wait, are you going to test them on your own?]]></string>
<string id="510881"><![CDATA[They might be useful.]]></string>
<string id="510882"><![CDATA[Thank you. You seem to be planning to test them out youself… or am I mistaken?]]></string>
<string id="510883"><![CDATA[I already have. Apparently, the one I got was efficient…]]></string>

<string id="510921"><![CDATA[Do you consider a mansion to be an inappropriate place for this? ]]></string>
<string id="510922"><![CDATA[I'll take a look at it. What about other facilities?]]></string>

<string id="510925"><![CDATA[What about the hospital?]]></string>
<string id="510926"><![CDATA[Discuss the marauders? Exterminating them is Saburov's duty. And he seemed to have enlisted every person who can hold a weapon for the job.]]></string>
<string id="510927"><![CDATA[I will examine the houses you have arranged for. If they meet minimal sanitary requirements, go ahead and start directing the sick there. Later I'll come back here to inform you when it's time to announce the hospital situation to the general public.]]></string>
<string id="510928"><![CDATA[…That would be the people we could use to perform sanitary work… I'm no less annoyed than you. But no, Victor wanted to discuss the… blocked off districts. He seems to have grand ideas regarding them and is seeking your advice. ]]></string>
<string id="510929"><![CDATA[Sure, I'll talk to him. Just do not rush to use the houses you have arranged for before I examine them. I need to be sure everything meets my requirements.]]></string>
<string id="510930"><![CDATA[You seem to be mistaken, good sir; I'm not annoyed at all. I approve of Saburov's decision.]]></string>
<string id="510931"><![CDATA[We didn't have much of a choice, esteemed Bachelor. If you find the results of our endeavors lackluster, then feel free to take our seat and aim for the better. I've no desire to listen to these… reprimands instead of the well-deserved words of praise.]]></string>
<string id="510932"><![CDATA[All right.  Any objections from the current inhabitants of the hospital-to-be?]]></string>
<string id="510933"><![CDATA[And those special buildings do have access to fresh water?]]></string>
<string id="510934"><![CDATA[The Cathedral and the Theatre do—they are supplied with spring water. Perhaps you've noticed the small fountains there… The Town Hall is connected to the general supply line… as are other buildings. ]]></string>

<string id="510936"><![CDATA[For goodness' sake!.. We've talked about this before, haven't we? Unlocking these buildings now would be... quite unwise. I really don't care for your persistence at all.

<string id="510953"><![CDATA[Oh really? And you are righteous people, I suppose?]]></string>
<string id="510954"><![CDATA[My folks have never taken knives to the streets! So we had a gatherin' yesterday. Here goes me sayin', "Anyone knife-hungry is welcome to get the fuck outta here, you ain't no brother to us! We don't want no blood on our hands." So Barley the Barber did, got up 'n got lost. The cunt went away to slaughter honest folks, and some of us lot went away with him, too!]]></string>
<string id="510955"><![CDATA[Who's Barley?]]></string>
<string id="510956"><![CDATA[A filthy bloodsuckin' butcher, that's what he is! He's got one joy—killin' 'em folks. Nothin' is sacred for the cunt.

'Tis for their sins that Saburov sets his rabid mongrels after us!]]></string>

<string id="510977"><![CDATA[How do you even picture it? If any bum could come in here and live at your place for a day… they'd drag the infection in with them!]]></string>
<string id="510978"><![CDATA[A day is too much. The Sand Plague symptoms don't take that long to become apparent, so very few real infected people will be able to make it to this place. They say it's fast as a burn.]]></string>
<string id="510980"><![CDATA[That remains to be proven.]]></string>
<string id="510981"><![CDATA[It's tough, but if that's what has to be done… Then that's fine, I'll make do. There won't be too many patients, even fewer of them strangers… But we're out of water! We need to arrange for it to be delivered. Vlad the Younger can help with that, he knows the local water supply chain like the back of his hand.]]></string>
<string id="510982"><![CDATA[Lara, this is suicide. I'll issue an order to relocate the isolation ward to an abandoned house.]]></string>
<string id="510983"><![CDATA[Don't. It's me who wants the isolation ward to be here. Then people will remember this house and connect its good reputation to our family's name.]]></string>
<string id="510984"><![CDATA[I don't understand…]]></string>
<string id="510985"><![CDATA[Fine. Have it your way.]]></string>
<string id="510986"><![CDATA[Tell me.]]></string>
<string id="510987"><![CDATA[No! Enough questions, please. I've already told you more than I should have.]]></string>
<string id="510988"><![CDATA[Fine. Have it your way.]]></string>
<string id="510989"><![CDATA[Well, it's not running anymore. I don't know why. The pipes are empty. They produced rusty clotted liquid of reddish colour for a while, but then it was gone too.]]></string>
<string id="510990"><![CDATA[That means no isolation ward in this house, not unless we figure this out. Water is essential for maintaining the proper sanitary conditions.]]></string>
<string id="510991"><![CDATA[Perhaps Vlad the Younger could be of help. He's been making himself busy with waterpipes, wells, and the likes for years… I think it's personal. He treats water as if it was liquid gold—and procures it just as eagerly.]]></string>
<string id="510992"><![CDATA[Who can sort this out?]]></string>
<string id="510993"><![CDATA[All right, I'll talk to him about it.]]></string>
<string id="510994"><![CDATA[Okay. And hear this: if the Olgimsky couriers come knocking on your door, slam that door in their faces. There will be no isolation ward here as long as there's no water. That's an order.]]></string>
<string id="510995"><![CDATA[Lara, I'm afraid we're about to have a rather difficult talk. Did you know that the water supply has been damaged deliberately?]]></string>
<string id="510996"><![CDATA[Heavens, no! Who would even consider that?]]></string>
<string id="510997"><![CDATA[That's what I want you to tell me. With whom did you talk about the water before the supply was cut?]]></string>
<string id="510998"><![CDATA[I'm not entirely sure… There were many people. I talked to everyone who was helping me with The House of the Living. I must have asked someone to deliver water, of course.]]></string>
<string id="510999"><![CDATA[Who was that?]]></string>
<string id="511000"><![CDATA[Let me see… Perhaps... Right, I talked about the water with Daddy Yaklakh. He used to be a taskmaster in the Termitary... then he bought himself out and became a patrolman. I did indeed tell him that he should boil water before using it… that it's risky to drink natural water just like that. But I didn't mean any harm!]]></string>
<string id="511001"><![CDATA[How about the stinking clots? Did you tell anyone about them?]]></string>
<string id="511002"><![CDATA[The clots? No, I didn't… But, just so that you know, there was this odd clingy lady in Earth terrorizing everyone with questions about bloody clots in the water… Perhaps she may know something?]]></string>
<string id="511003"><![CDATA[How about you give it another round of thought? Malicious gossip has it that the people that have destroyed the town's water supply did so at your instigation.]]></string>
<string id="511004"><![CDATA[I know. Her name is Aspity. It was she who claimed that you were the person to inspire some simple-hearted fool to destroy the water line.]]></string>
<string id="511005"><![CDATA[Well, that's a no-brainer, a newborn baby knows that. No one could have gone rampant destroying the town's water supply chain because of this rather straightforward information.]]></string>
<string id="511006"><![CDATA[He also asked me whether one should boil the rags and bedsheets that the infected were dying on. I remember it weirded me out a bit—why would he ask me about bedsheets? He's a patrolman, not a laundry person… ]]></string>
<string id="511007"><![CDATA[What did you tell him?]]></string>
<string id="511008"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="511009"><![CDATA[Of course I told him he should do that! He's from the Kin, you see. He had to be explained the benefits of boiling water. So I did my best to describe to him how that is useful—and essential to hygiene.]]></string>
<string id="511010"><![CDATA[Makes sense. You did nothing wrong.]]></string>
<string id="511011"><![CDATA[You really shouldn't have.]]></string>
<string id="511012"><![CDATA[Sounds weird indeed. I feel like I come by Aspity once more…]]></string>
<string id="511019"><![CDATA[What does the local water supply look like?]]></string>
<string id="511020"><![CDATA[It exists; there even is a water supply system—which is in itself quite amazing, don't you think? It was constructed after the fire, at the same time as the Termitary. The water pumps you've doubtlessly noticed in the streets are also connected to it. But that's not all.]]></string>
<string id="511021"><![CDATA[What else?]]></string>
<string id="511022"><![CDATA[There are several springs inside the town and in the surrounding Steppe. They all have beautiful names in the local language. Three of them are in the town: by the Cathedral, by the Theatre, and… well, the third one was ruined during the construction of the Bull Project. It dried up.]]></string>
<string id="511023"><![CDATA[There must be some wells too.]]></string>
<string id="511024"><![CDATA[What are their names?]]></string>
<string id="511025"><![CDATA[The Stone Yard spring is called Golgur. The etymology of the word is unclear, but it means something along the lines of "a smooth mouthful". The Spin-a-Yarn Square spring is called Typkhe, which simply means "a well". The ruined spring was called Sugagh Khadugh.]]></string>
<string id="511026"><![CDATA[I see. So the three of them are still supplying water, right? Or is it only two?]]></string>
<string id="511027"><![CDATA[When Sugagh Khadugh was crushed, it flowed underground, but then returned to the surface. The locals maintain that it was angry with people, so it's chosen an evil place to do that. Popped out like a varicose vein in a place dramatically unfit for producing drinking water: by the cemetery, the Rotten Field, and the Khato dead pile.]]></string>
<string id="511029"><![CDATA[What about the wells situation in the town?]]></string>
<string id="511030"><![CDATA[Sadly, no wells; that's another local taboo that is most likely going to make your work harder. This is all quite unfortunate, wouldn't you agree? But well-digging is forbidden around here. The consequences can be very harsh.]]></string>
<string id="511031"><![CDATA[That's… unique. What is this thing before me then?]]></string>
<string id="511032"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="511033"><![CDATA[This is a secret. And I seem to be close to unravelling it.]]></string>
<string id="511034"><![CDATA[Do many people know about your well?]]></string>
<string id="511035"><![CDATA[In theory, no one, but I suspect that in practice many do. The only reason I haven't been buried inside of it is the lenience of the current Foreman of the Abattoir. But father has a stranglehold on him, which is quite a feat in itself.]]></string>
<string id="511036"><![CDATA[Very well. How do you propose to solve the water supply issue?]]></string>
<string id="511037"><![CDATA[What are you expecting to dig out?]]></string>
<string id="511038"><![CDATA[Oh, you'd definitely make fun of me if I told you, so don't even try to guess.]]></string>
<string id="511039"><![CDATA[Gold?]]></string>
<string id="511040"><![CDATA[Of the liquid kind.]]></string>
<string id="511041"><![CDATA[Surely it's not oil?]]></string>
<string id="511042"><![CDATA[Earth's blood? You could put it that way. Like I said, do not guess, doctor. This has nothing to do with our current problem.]]></string>
<string id="511043"><![CDATA[Fine. Let's get back to that.]]></string>

<string id="511046"><![CDATA[Not you, of course. Your father.]]></string>
<string id="511047"><![CDATA[Oh. That changes everything. My father and I are one and the same. At the very least, you can always count on me when it comes to his duties before the town.]]></string>
<string id="511048"><![CDATA[So what do you think?]]></string>
<string id="511049"><![CDATA[If I were you, I'd seize the Cathedral and the Theatre as soon as possible; those buildings have access to spring water. Although, with dangerous zealots popping up, the town's springs are to be feared for as well. Who knows what those idiots will think up next... Are you planning to find them, by the way?]]></string>
<string id="511050"><![CDATA[Of course.]]></string>
<string id="511051"><![CDATA[Let Saburov handle it. Chasing outlaws and halfwits is his job.]]></string>
<string id="511052"><![CDATA[Water deliveries clearly need to be arranged. But since we need to set up a hospital… and all those plague facilities… I'm afraid we can only carry water from the Sugagh Khadugh spring. Yes, that would be a bit better than trying purified water from Gorkhon's tributaries.]]></string>
<string id="511053"><![CDATA[The Sugagh Khadugh spring?]]></string>
<string id="511054"><![CDATA[All right, far be it from me to insist. So what shall we do?]]></string>
<string id="511055"><![CDATA[They're very likely to be hiding in the same dens as the runaway rebels—which does, by the way, give you food for thought… but nevermind that. In any case, it would make sense to speak with Aspity… It would be rather disappointing to die of thirst while everyone is busy dying of the Sand Plague.]]></string>
<string id="511056"><![CDATA[Let's do our best to make sure nobody dies of thirst.]]></string>
<string id="511057"><![CDATA[Everything's in your hands.]]></string>
<string id="511058"><![CDATA[I'll order to start arranging water deliveries and post guards at the Sugagh Khadugh spring. It won't be enough for the whole town, but it's better than nothing. You should hurry up and seize the springs at the Stone Yard and Spin-a-Yarn Square—that is, the Cathedral's and the Theatre's springs.]]></string>
<string id="511059"><![CDATA[Not just find, but properly punish them too.]]></string>
<string id="511060"><![CDATA[Agreed. Those who would doom the town to die of thirst are bound for the Bone Stake. Whoever is behind this atrocity, there shall be no mercy for them. Not even if it turns out to be my own sister.]]></string>

<string id="511086"><![CDATA[I'm telling you, the taskmaster is not to blame. He tried to do the good thing. It was explained to him loud and clear that the disease comes from water. It was a good deed! No one should drink that water! How many times do I have to tell you? Do you think I'm joking? It's bloody and poisonous!]]></string>
<string id="511087"><![CDATA[I'm not gonna tell you. I'm not a snitch! And it's too late anyway. Everyone overreacted. No one had malicious intentions. The Gorkhon's water is bad, and I'm glad it won't be drunk. We'll make do with the springs and the water we've stocked up on.

<string id="511098"><![CDATA[Indeed. You're reading my thoughts. The Skinners have died out. Supposedly, it has become entirely free of infection. The streets, the walls, the various objects and even the corpses; everything is clean. People can safely touch bodies that only recently were a very strong source of infection...]]></string>

<string id="511104"><![CDATA[Yes, that does seem to fit with the discovery I made yesterday…]]></string>
<string id="511105"><![CDATA[What can I do to help?]]></string>
<string id="511106"><![CDATA[Take a look around the Skinners. Check inside the houses. If they truly are clean, find something that could prove it. And of course, you may use any abandoned property as you see fit. Better you get it than the looters.]]></string>
<string id="511107"><![CDATA[Yes, that's promising. I'll be back with a report.]]></string>
<string id="511108"><![CDATA[It's dangerous. I'll take my time to think it over.]]></string>
<string id="511109"><![CDATA[I don't wish to think that we are being eaten alive… But given how fast it's spreading, that just might be true.]]></string>
<string id="511110"><![CDATA[I've decided to inspect that boarded-up district after all.]]></string>
<string id="511111"><![CDATA[Thank you. I'll await your verdict.]]></string>
<string id="511112"><![CDATA[I'll be back soon.]]></string>
<string id="511113"><![CDATA[I have inspected the district. I'll take it upon myself to confirm that the rumours are true. The district is clean. And a little freer of looters now.]]></string>
<string id="511114"><![CDATA[Good tidings! This will help ease the fate of the epidemic's latest victims.]]></string>
<string id="511115"><![CDATA[Even better than you think. If we can prevent unnecessary commotion and keep the healthy in isolation wards, we'll stop the disease. It will burn out like a forest fire.]]></string>
<string id="511116"><![CDATA[Are you now certain that the disease doesn't stay dormant in an infected person for a while before revealing itself? I dare not doubt your expertise… However, until we have established the origin of the infection, it's too early to declare the enemy defeated.]]></string>
<string id="511118"><![CDATA[Yes, you're right. But the ward will become operational soon. I hope you won't be offended, but it's going to be set up in the town's Cathedral. I have very high hopes for the facility.]]></string>
<string id="511119"><![CDATA[Indeed? Well, it was conceived as a shelter for those in need. Now it can finally fulfil its intended function.]]></string>

<string id="511130"><![CDATA[Indeed. The microbe cannot survive in a non-organic environment. The walls of infected buildings and sometimes the ground itself were covered in some peculiar organic matter that was dying as fast as it was spreading. I would be very interested to study this filth at a laboratory.]]></string>
<string id="511131"><![CDATA[Sadly, all we can study now are these... half-dead scraps. I don't think that what we can observe is reflective of how a full-fledged bacterium will behave.

Conceivably, any one of the medicines may curb the sickness at a certain stage of its development. An exciting experiment if I ever saw one; not quite unlike the feats of power they had in times long-forgotten. A trial of fate!]]></string>
<string id="511323"><![CDATA[Still, Yulia, why are you so intent on doing the testing personally?]]></string>
<string id="511324"><![CDATA[Didn't I tell you before? I am testing one of my theories; a hypothesis that destiny may be manipulated. As adventurous as I may be, I am anything but irresponsible. I am much better equipped to conduct this kind of research than that poor tanner may ever hope to be. I will be able to keep a journal of my observations, my physical sensations, the change of my body temperature... If nothing else, I won't mix up the medicine.]]></string>
<string id="511328"><![CDATA[Nothing revolutionary, I assure you. The experiment is, fundamentally, getting myself infected and using the three medicinal formulas one after the other. Besides, the Olgimsky girl provided me with a "shmowder" that I am to use if neither of the pills has effect. Absolutely precious, these shmowders. Extremely detrimental for your liver, but also certain to remove the infection. Everything will work out just fine, I hope.]]></string>
<string id="511329"><![CDATA[What medicine were you given?]]></string>
<string id="511330"><![CDATA[Here. It is called feromycinum. The most powerful medicant they had in stock, as well as the most hazardous. Known to purge the bacteria by means of destroying all manner of microflora; harmful and otherwise. If it proves to be of use, the Olgimsky family will distribute it throughout the town.]]></string>

<string id="511353"><![CDATA[She's supposed to test some sort of antibiotic. Her task is to become infected and then treat herself with it. If the drug fails, her only option is to cure herself at the last moment with a diabolical concoction, that mismash children's thing.

<string id="511386"><![CDATA[I can inform Vlad the Younger that the barter went through successfully. The Olgimskys have left the Polyhedron be, and the Kains have stopped trying to get into the Termitary. Everyone's happy.]]></string>

<string id="511393"><![CDATA[Then hurry up and tell Andrey! Or else he'll drink himself cockeyed again and we won't get any help from him.]]></string>
<string id="511394"><![CDATA[Wait here.]]></string>
<string id="511395"><![CDATA[They say you saw some significant success yesterday. So random antibiotics really can help against the Sand Fever?]]></string>
<string id="511396"><![CDATA[How is the distribution of drugs going? Why is there still no medicine in the town?]]></string>
<string id="511397"><![CDATA[The drugs we confiscated two days ago turned out to be outdated; moreover, many are expired and now harmful. Many are probably useless. We will check every drug today. Those that actually prove effective will be put into distribution immediately.]]></string>
<string id="511398"><![CDATA[How will the tests be conducted?]]></string>
<string id="511399"><![CDATA[I've found some people with a death wish… Those are desperate people on the verge of a nervous breakdown. And so I have tasked several young ladies, whom you probably know, with supervising the tests. They are Eva Yan, Yulia Lyuricheva, Anna Angel, and Lara Ravel. They'll report the results tonight.]]></string>
<string id="511400"><![CDATA[Why haven't you told me anything?]]></string>
<string id="511401"><![CDATA[You were very busy yesterday, and we spent the whole day inspecting and writing down the requisitioned stockpiles. Today, as you can see, I'm informing you of my plans… Don't worry, Bachelor. This is the best possible course of action. Or do you have a better one?]]></string>
<string id="511408"><![CDATA[I sincerely hope you don't, master Vlad.]]></string>
<string id="511409"><![CDATA[Couldn't you supervise the experiment yourself?]]></string>
<string id="511410"><![CDATA[The young ladies offered their help voluntarily—with the task that I believe to be the least dangerous. I doubt they'd prefer to test the drugs themselves instead of sending death-seekers into infected districts.]]></string>
<string id="511411"><![CDATA[And if they will?]]></string>
<string id="511412"><![CDATA[Woe is us then. Maybe there's still time to change their minds. But Bachelor, if they do conduct the tests on themselves, we can at least be certain of their failure or success.]]></string>
<string id="511413"><![CDATA[You're not an easy man to read, master Vlad. Don't worry. I'll handle it all myself.]]></string>
<string id="511414"><![CDATA[Then why entrust them with such an important task?]]></string>
<string id="511415"><![CDATA[Don’t worry. Trust the young ladies—and me. Even if something goes wrong, we will only lose a few hours.]]></string>
<string id="511416"><![CDATA[But we don't have an hour to lose.]]></string>
<string id="511417"><![CDATA[I'll distribute the pills among the tradespeople all right, but what if they return to me all infected? Come on, this is a conveniently roundabout murder—and nothing else. Those poor souls were also picked from death row. That's what I call "Olgimsky-style"!]]></string>
<string id="511419"><![CDATA[I still don't understand what you three have to do with this. Why can't Vlad see to the volunteers himself?]]></string>
<string id="511421"><![CDATA[That does sound strange…]]></string>
<string id="511422"><![CDATA[They're getting back at me for refusing to hand over my pills back then… As if I was obliged to, as if it was in any way fair to make me! Perhaps they even think I knew about the disaster beforehand? That I'm behind it?]]></string>

<string id="511424"><![CDATA[Show me what you've ben given.]]></string>
<string id="511425"><![CDATA[Just in case. What's it to you? I could've just as easily been stockpiling water.]]></string>
<string id="511426"><![CDATA[Someone stockpiling water is probably expecting to get very thirsty very soon…]]></string>

<string id="511429"><![CDATA[So... What does the process that you have in mind look like?]]></string>
<string id="511435"><![CDATA[Tell me, are you really planning to test antibiotics? ]]></string>
<string id="511436"><![CDATA[No, I'm not.]]></string>
<string id="511437"><![CDATA[Vlad the Younger claims that he asked you to test some dubious remedies.]]></string>
<string id="511438"><![CDATA[I wanted to try the antibiotics, but… I wasn't allowed to. I'll have to work with painkillers. Vlad the Younger says they're closer to my line of trade anyway; if I'm to host The House of the Living, I'll have to handle them often. They ease pain, but also make you drowsy and apathetic...]]></string>
<string id="511439"><![CDATA[How exactly are you planning to test them anyway?]]></string>
<string id="511440"><![CDATA[I know how they work. All I need to do is find a man whose line of work naturally leads to being wounded frequently. I was planning to distribute the drugs among the patrolmen, but I could rather give them to you if you wish… If you have any success testing each of the three types, then that means they're still fine. Then the Olgimskys will begin giving them out to the population.]]></string>
<string id="511441"><![CDATA[Fine.]]></string>
<string id="511442"><![CDATA[You know what? There's something else I want to ask of you. Please put a stop to Yulia's efforts and support Anna! Yulia has her own motives, yet I have a terrible suspicion she may have given up to despair… and poor Anna doesn't deserve this either. I'm absolutely positive that she isn't planning to offer the medicine assigned to her to the test subjects—she's too compassionate for that... but she won't go anywhere herself either.]]></string>
<string id="511443"><![CDATA[What's wrong with Anna?]]></string>
<string id="511444"><![CDATA[She is certain the Olgimskys are only doing this to get to her… and to have her dead. She might not be all that wrong.]]></string>
<string id="511445"><![CDATA[Oh really?]]></string>
<string id="511446"><![CDATA[I don't think it's Big Vlad… Yet the Olgimskys are definitely a threat to her! There isn't a shade of doubt in anyone's mind that one of them will become the death of her. ]]></string>
<string id="511447"><![CDATA[I see. Okay, now please hand over the painkillers—they'll be of use to me.]]></string>
<string id="511448"><![CDATA[More fortune-telling… Go ahead and distribute the painkillers among the patrolmen.]]></string>
<string id="511449"><![CDATA[That's fine, they'll be of more use to the patrolmen.]]></string>
<string id="511450"><![CDATA[Hmm… Have I been misinformed?]]></string>
<string id="511451"><![CDATA[And who told you about me?]]></string>
<string id="511452"><![CDATA[Olgimsky.]]></string>
<string id="511453"><![CDATA[Yulia is the one to test the antibiotics. She'll administer them to the infected and watch the recovery process… or rather the battle inside their immune systems. It's very dangerous! She's even been provided this horrible children's powder—in case she accidently catches the disease and the antibiotics prove to be useless.]]></string>
<string id="511454"><![CDATA[What are you going to test then?]]></string>
<string id="511455"><![CDATA[And how exactly are you planning to conduct the test? You're completely healthy!]]></string>
<string id="511456"><![CDATA[Nonsense. These don't help; they kill. Anyway, where are you going to test them?]]></string>
<string id="511457"><![CDATA[They identified another infected house last night. The building was locked down and cordoned off. From what I know, the plan is to test immunity boosters in the environment conducive to infection. There is some kind of mildew all over the house, I have heard, or some manner of sporiferous mould...]]></string>
<string id="511458"><![CDATA[Show me the antibiotics.]]></string>
<string id="511464"><![CDATA[Neither is it mine, I'm afraid. I wish you the best of luck.]]></string>
<string id="511467"><![CDATA[Much obliged. I am almost not afraid at all.]]></string>
<string id="511468"><![CDATA[Nevertheless, I'd send a suicide tester, if I were you.]]></string>
<string id="511469"><![CDATA[Nevertheless, Yulia, I'd rather step in for you. Give me your capsules.]]></string>
<string id="511470"><![CDATA[Thank you. For some reason, I fail to muster up the courage...]]></string>
<string id="511471"><![CDATA[It's only natural.]]></string>
<string id="511472"><![CDATA[Even if there is indeed no hope, admitting that is a crime.]]></string>
<string id="511473"><![CDATA[Give me your pills, Anna. I'll go to the infected house myself.]]></string>
<string id="511474"><![CDATA[Oh, but you'd be all locked up there! You'd have to spend a lot of time inside… and it's not like it's obligatory! Just distribute the first portion and check on the outcome… we'll live and see just how effective they are.]]></string>
<string id="511475"><![CDATA[Weren't you saying they're dangerous? No, I will not have that. Please kindly hand the pills over.]]></string>
<string id="511476"><![CDATA[I've changed my mind. Please do hand over that morphine of yours—or what was it? It'll provide useful for me today.]]></string>
<string id="511477"><![CDATA[It's not just morphine, there are also etorphine and novocaine. Take them.]]></string>
<string id="511478"><![CDATA[Thank you. And remember, no going outside!]]></string>

<string id="511483"><![CDATA[Vlad the Younger is more knowledgeable about the local water supply than anyone else in the town.]]></string>
<string id="511485"><![CDATA[BREAD. A piece of stale bread. Hard as rock, but with no signs of mould. Unlikely to be dangerous, but rumour has it that it can be.]]></string>
<string id="511486"><![CDATA[So who's going to stop them?]]></string>
<string id="511487"><![CDATA[I need to talk to Bad Grief about the thieves' rowdiness. The governor is planning to end their abuse shortly and swiftly.]]></string>

<string id="511490"><![CDATA[Wonderful. Do not hesitate to kill them. I can't give out a reward for every outlaw killed—my coffers are almost empty. But your reputation will only benefit from this, of that I assure you.]]></string>
<string id="511491"><![CDATA[I need a weapon.]]></string>
<string id="511492"><![CDATA[Everybody's asking for weapons! I've already told you that we don't have any. Even a knife will cost a fortune now. I can only issue to you what little our valiant patrolmen can requisition from the populace.]]></string>

<string id="511494"><![CDATA[This Barley is hiding somewhere in Earth, among the factory buildings. There aren't so many warehouses there… I'll find this lair of lawlessness—better late than never…]]></string>

<string id="511496"><![CDATA[Good! We shall root out crime with extreme prejudice!]]></string>

<string id="511498"><![CDATA[They're driven to this by despair and the lack of order. There are plenty of bad examples turning townsfolk into killers. Fear shall be our weapon. When those family men see how mercilessly we deal with murderers, they'll think twice before touching a knife.]]></string>

<string id="511505"><![CDATA[No, I can't hear anything.]]></string>
<string id="511506"><![CDATA[Aspity was mocking me! Of course Lara is innocent—the uneducated mob has merely misinterpreted her words. But why did she do it?! It's like she was trying to buy time… for what?]]></string>
<string id="511507"><![CDATA[I need to inform Olgimsky about the sabotage. It brings all his efforts to naught.]]></string>

<string id="511521"><![CDATA[THEATRE KEY. Now the building can be inspected and appropriated for sanitary needs. The Theatre is the heart of the town. Its transformation into a hospital will be symbolic in a way. Instead of solemn Mask plays it shall now perform guignol.]]></string>

<string id="511527"><![CDATA[You're here at last! Damn my position... I have no choice but to hide from the townsfolk, see? I understand their anger, but they have armed search parties to hunt me down, as if I were spreading the plague rather than trying my best to stop it!]]></string>
<string id="511528"><![CDATA[Any good news?]]></string>
<string id="511529"><![CDATA[Oh yes. We won't be able to produce a full-fledged vaccine in these conditions, true, but with a little bit of luck we'll succeed to make a reliable preventive formula. Admittedly, the effect of the injection won't last longer than ten hours or so... Still, if it proves effectual, many lives will be saved!]]></string>

<string id="511550"><![CDATA[So now what?]]></string>
<string id="511551"><![CDATA[Now I'll begin to produce the vaccine. I wonder how many hearts it would take to make enough doses…?]]></string>
<string id="511552"><![CDATA[The technology itself is what matters. We'll report our findings to the Inquisitor and let him get the components. After all, is it not the reason he was delegated here…?]]></string>
<string id="511553"><![CDATA[Fair enough. Come tomorrow, early in the morning. Or even tonight; the vaccine should be ready for testing.]]></string>
<string id="511554"><![CDATA[How is it going to work?]]></string>
<string id="511555"><![CDATA[I don't know yet. The solution needs to be tested. However, given that it's not really a vaccine, but rather a preventive medicine, I would expect its effect to be temporary. It won't protect the inoculated person forever.]]></string>

<string id="511561"><![CDATA[Yes, I sorely need to find him.]]></string>
<string id="511562"><![CDATA[Then you'll be most unhappy to learn that he's been seized on Saburov's orders. I was informed by Lara Ravel about it. A witness of Burakh's arrest came by to her place.]]></string>
<string id="511563"><![CDATA[Seized? Why?]]></string>
<string id="511564"><![CDATA[A groundless suspicion. Many innocent people were arrested and thrown into the dungeons of the Town Hall last night. Barley and his barbers caused quite a stir yesterday—a stir that has made quite an... ahem... impression on Saburov. And so he resorted to harsh punitive measures. Everything goes exactly as expected; this is his first step towards autocracy.]]></string>
<string id="511565"><![CDATA[What is Burakh being accused of?]]></string>
<string id="511566"><![CDATA[I don't know, but I have absolutely no doubt it's a false accusation! Artemy has been accused of every possible villainy lately. They call him the Ripper. They cry bloody murder while he works his fingers to the bone trying to save us all. But no one cares about it at all!]]></string>
<string id="511567"><![CDATA[I'll demand that Saburov let him go.]]></string>
<string id="511568"><![CDATA[Give it a try, dear doctor. Artemy deserves it. Even if he has taken it upon himself to break a law or two, we need him alive. Perhaps if you vouched for him, the fierce Saburov would let him go... Oh what a grave mistake it was to grant him full authority! Your mistake, doctor...]]></string>

<string id="511573"><![CDATA[No, doctor, even if the Sand Plague is merciful to you, the inhabitants of the Termitary will not extend similar kindness. You are our last hope, the only doctor that hasn't succumbed to despair and is still fighting. Risking your life would be the last thing I would do—even if that meant becoming the next victim of Saburov's abuse.]]></string>

<string id="511577"><![CDATA[I'm afraid young Burakh doesn't have much time left. He has been labelled an outlaw. It seems that everyone but I thinks him to be a monster. And he will never be left at peace after what happened today.]]></string>

<string id="511592"><![CDATA[They say you've arrested Burakh. Is that true?]]></string>
<string id="511593"><![CDATA[Absolutely. That villain was seized as well. Like I said, the night was bountiful: the patrolmen killed more than fifty armed thugs. Fifty more were arrested. Soon they're going to be tried by our military court.]]></string>
<string id="511594"><![CDATA[Was Burakh caught red-handed?]]></string>
<string id="511595"><![CDATA[If he were caught red-handed, he'd have been executed on the spot. Just like anyone else who was caught in the act. There's a whole lot of accusations against him though. Mark Karminsky will expose his crimes easily.]]></string>
<string id="511596"><![CDATA[Let Burakh go, governor! He must help me with fulfilling my duties!]]></string>
<string id="511597"><![CDATA[Never. Burakh is accused of a dozen murders at least, including his father's, violation of sacred customs and desecration of the dead. He's the most dangerous criminal of all who have appeared in the town in these horrible days. I won't ever let him out even if you vouch for him.]]></string>

<string id="511613"><![CDATA[Who made the charges?]]></string>
<string id="511614"><![CDATA[People I trust as much as myself. The patrolmen who selflessly serve to maintain order and keep townsfolk safe from violence caused by that out-of-control scum. ]]></string>
<string id="511615"><![CDATA[Prove it then. There is this thing called the presumption of innocence. Is it no more one of the basics of criminal law?]]></string>
<string id="511616"><![CDATA[Not since a state of emergency was declared in the town. As you can see, I have executed no one. All of them are waiting for the Inquisitor's trial.]]></string>
<string id="511617"><![CDATA[You've made people angry! It was hard enough for them to keep from violence when the situation prompted them to! Now they're furious since their virtuous restraint was penalized rather than appreciated!]]></string>
<string id="511618"><![CDATA[We can't take any chances. We have to catch every suspicious-looking person, in order to avoid further murders.]]></string>
<string id="511619"><![CDATA[If you keep doing it the way you do it now, mark my words, you won't prevent further murders, you'll cause them.]]></string>
<string id="511620"><![CDATA[I guess you feel obligated to be a humanist, Bachelor. Do you really think the arrests will provoke the people? Don't. We're past fearing popular unrest. The most terrible things have already happened. It can't get any worse.]]></string>
<string id="511621"><![CDATA[You're wrong! The Inquisitor will make me responsible, not you.]]></string>
<string id="511622"><![CDATA[I'm not a humanist. I don't care much about those people's sorrows. But what you've been doing here is suicidal. I'm telling you this because I care about what will happen in the streets tomorrow!]]></string>
<string id="511623"><![CDATA[Oh… that changes everything.]]></string>
<string id="511624"><![CDATA[The infection has reached the jail, governor! The inmates are panicking. Set them free, or, I swear, you'll be the one to answer to the Inquisitor! I'll make sure of that.]]></string>
<string id="511625"><![CDATA[I can answer for myself just fine, Bachelor. By the way, if you expect the Inquisitor to show more mercy, then you know nothing of Inquisitors. Especially not the one sent here by the Powers That Be.]]></string>
<string id="511626"><![CDATA[I've found out who the prisoners are. They are not murderers.]]></string>
<string id="511627"><![CDATA[I can tell you as well. They are criminals! The ones who destroyed the water supply. The ones who looted the blocked districts. Suspicious-looking armed scum who were caught near the Wastehouse!]]></string>
<string id="511628"><![CDATA[And who would that be?]]></string>
<string id="511629"><![CDATA[We aren't sure yet, but it's already clear that it will be either Orff or Karminsky. I can't tell which one is worse.]]></string>
<string id="511630"><![CDATA[I'm ready to bail the innocent ones out. How much do you want for each one?]]></string>
<string id="511631"><![CDATA[I'm ready to bail the innocent ones out. How much do you want for each one?]]></string>
<string id="511632"><![CDATA[They're not in debtors' prison, Bachelor! They're accused of robberies and banditism, and should be put on trial. No bail. Better death sets them free than your money.]]></string>
<string id="511633"><![CDATA[Damn you to hell!]]></string>
<string id="511634"><![CDATA[You're making a mistake.]]></string>
<string id="511635"><![CDATA[Of course you did.]]></string>
<string id="511640"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="511641"><![CDATA[I'm beginning to feel that the wheel of my fortune… has finally touched me.]]></string>
<string id="511642"><![CDATA[Please convince your spouse to set Artemy Burakh free. He was arrested on a false accusation.]]></string>
<string id="511643"><![CDATA[This cannot be... I do not dare to interfere with my husband's decisions.]]></string>
<string id="511644"><![CDATA[Don't you care about Burakh?]]></string>
<string id="511645"><![CDATA[Of course I do…. I dislike this man… If my intution doesn't fail me… he's bound to cause much grief to our town. And I know that my intuition is correct… My star has finally ascended. I've never sensed the threads of the future as clearly as I do these days.]]></string>
<string id="511646"><![CDATA[Yet you've foretold my death—the death I have safely avoided.]]></string>
<string id="511647"><![CDATA[…Have you now?]]></string>
<string id="511648"><![CDATA[I'm alive.]]></string>
<string id="511649"><![CDATA[I don't know… It's very unclear… Sometimes people consider themselves alive when they're already corpses…]]></string>
<string id="511650"><![CDATA[I don't think I have to dispute the obvious.]]></string>
<string id="511651"><![CDATA[Can you even imagine what it's like in the local jail right now?]]></string>
<string id="511652"><![CDATA[We don't have a jail…]]></string>
<string id="511653"><![CDATA[Where do you keep prisoners then?]]></string>
<string id="511654"><![CDATA[In the Town Hall's dungeons… I'm listening… to what goes on there… Fear… hatred… revenge… the desire to kill, to kill as many as possible… A concoction of emotions—and not a tiniest shred of thought… That's what I sense.]]></string>
<string id="511655"><![CDATA[Is Burakh held there?]]></string>
<string id="511656"><![CDATA[Very unlikely… The whole Town Hall is chock-full of arrested bandits, though the building was never designed to become a jail… It was founded as a book depository… No, my spouse keeps the beast in its own lair. Or maybe by the lair… so forget your pointless pursuit...]]></string>
<string id="511657"><![CDATA[Why would he keep him "by" the lair? It would be way easier to hold the beast under arrest at his own place.]]></string>
<string id="511658"><![CDATA[Mmm… Perhaps it's because there was less noise across… the place—it was very quiet. He'd rather have the clanking of iron, so no one would hear the screams or shouting… No one would come to the rescue… How cold… I'm shivering…]]></string>
<string id="511659"><![CDATA[Pity.]]></string>
<string id="511660"><![CDATA[I hope it doesn't break you.]]></string>
<string id="511661"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="511662"><![CDATA[We're still alive... how very strange.]]></string>
<string id="511663"><![CDATA[Lara, please tell me, is the man who witnessed Burakh's arrest still here?]]></string>
<string id="511664"><![CDATA[You mean the Harpist. He's dead.]]></string>
<string id="511665"><![CDATA[What were his words?]]></string>
<string id="511666"><![CDATA[That his only final wish was to eat a handful of large raspberries.]]></string>
<string id="511667"><![CDATA[No… I meant about Burakh's arrest. Did he say anything about where he was taken?]]></string>
<string id="511668"><![CDATA[He saw them escort him, nothing more. It was by the Rail Bridge. He was seized by Saburov's patrolmen—there were three of them, and yet they barely managed to keep him under control. When they were crossing the embankment, Burakh broke loose, so they knocked him to the ground. The Harpist said he also thought back then that they wouldn't be able to take him anywhere far. And then he felt sick.]]></string>
<string id="511669"><![CDATA[Why are the Saburovs doing that to him?]]></string>
<string id="511670"><![CDATA[I think he got into Clara's way somehow. This Clara girl seems pretty scary… I guess Artemy must have disrupted her plans—and I doubt she was planning to do good. As for Burakh, on the other hand, his noble intentions are apparent.]]></string>
<string id="511671"><![CDATA[How is she scary?]]></string>
<string id="511672"><![CDATA[I can't tell if she's a healer or a killer... It's so confusing. But she's definitely unkind. Everything about her is just so suspicious… You know, sometimes I think it was she who made the Harpist die—the man who brought the news of Burakh's arrest.]]></string>
<string id="511673"><![CDATA[So you hold him in hight regard?]]></string>
<string id="511674"><![CDATA[He... He turned out to be a very impressive person. The semblance to his father is so strong! I can't help thinking about him… Indeed. He is an honest and brave man. You two would have made good friends.]]></string>
<string id="511675"><![CDATA[So Burakh's lair was at the Works?]]></string>
<string id="511676"><![CDATA[Somewhere in a suburbian area, in Earth. As far as I understood, the place aws industrial. I'd suspect the Termitary… but that's obviously impossible. Somewhere at the Works, perhaps? Try your luck there.]]></string>
<string id="511677"><![CDATA[Are there living quarters at the Works?]]></string>
<string id="511678"><![CDATA[I don't know. I've never been there. Although… Isidor did have a hideout or a secret lab at the Works... I remember him complaining that he was too old to climb over the embankment ten times a day and that railroad noise could be rather distracting.]]></string>
<string id="511679"><![CDATA[Do not mourn your loss, Lara. We all have to go some time.]]></string>
<string id="511680"><![CDATA[Did he tell you where they took Burakh?]]></string>
<string id="511681"><![CDATA[Did he have business with Burakh?]]></string>
<string id="511682"><![CDATA[He got it into his head that he's supposed to help Burakh in any way he could. He only came by here to grab the bare essentials—and said Artemy was the only person worth giving one's life for. But in the end his body just gave in…]]></string>
<string id="511683"><![CDATA[What about you? Do you like Burakh?]]></string>
<string id="511684"><![CDATA[Is that why they haven't taken Burakh to the Town Hall dungeons?]]></string>
<string id="511685"><![CDATA[I don't know… The Town Hall is chock-full of prisoners… dozens of people were arrested yesterday on various allegations, you know. Saburov probably wants to keep Burakh as far from the light of day—and anyone's eyes—as possible.]]></string>
<string id="511686"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="511687"><![CDATA[I suspect it was Katerina's whisper in his ear that became his inspiraton… they're playing a dark game.]]></string>

<string id="511692"><![CDATA[What's in it for you?]]></string>
<string id="511693"><![CDATA[I command you to set him free.]]></string>
<string id="511694"><![CDATA[I'm here to convoy Burakh to the governor's office.]]></string>
<string id="511695"><![CDATA[An order came through to transport the prisoner to the Town Hall.]]></string>
<string id="511696"><![CDATA[If this were the case, people of lower rank... and heavier build would have come. We know who you are, doctor. You are kindly joking, aren't you?]]></string>
<string id="511697"><![CDATA[I'm not. Bring the prisoner here.]]></string>
<string id="511698"><![CDATA[I was strictly ordered by governor Saburov to guard the prisoner with my life. There was a special order too: if the prisoner dies of the Sand Pest, we ain't supposed to bury him or give the body to the undertakers. We're to inform the governor in person and await further instructions.]]></string>
<string id="511699"><![CDATA[Don't you think that's a bit too strict?]]></string>
<string id="511700"><![CDATA[Strict my ass! We put almost seventy people behind bars yesterday, on suspicion, of course. Killed loads of folks too. Must've been thugs and cutthroats, the ones we've killed. I've heard their thug friends are all up in arms, planning to take revenge on us… But they're out of men—and out of luck.]]></string>
<string id="511701"><![CDATA[Is that so? I think you'd better stay alert, kind sir. The underground world has its ways of keeping its real power disguised.]]></string>

<string id="511709"><![CDATA[Eh… So what? I mean I'd like to, I would, Doc… Like I'd ever pass on the chance. But, eh… the honey's sweet, but the bees sting. Them patrollin' bees are much worse than them worker bees, y'know, they hit hard and without a shred of pity, organized too. They'll show us no mercy, they won't. Their orders are, we deserve no mercy. We deserve bein' strangled, exterminated, 'n buried alive.]]></string>
<string id="511710"><![CDATA[I need your help. Set Burakh free. I'll cover you.]]></string>
<string id="511711"><![CDATA[This is the dear kind of help, dear Doc. It won't come cheap.]]></string>
<string id="511712"><![CDATA[Name your price then. Like I could ever expect anything else from you!]]></string>
<string id="511713"><![CDATA[Avenge your dead, Grief. It's a good opportunity. Bring the patrolmen down. They'll get what they deserve.]]></string>
<string id="511714"><![CDATA[Why would I, Doc? They ain't no fuzz, y'know, they used to be our lot. They're doin' their job just fine—'tis their duty to hold the pest back, it is…]]></string>
<string id="511715"><![CDATA[Indeed. But the exact persons I'm talking about have abandoned the community service for the favours from the higher-ups.]]></string>
<string id="511716"><![CDATA[Bring us ten grand—I'll bail out my hawks, arrested on filthy slander and false accusations, myself. Their only option's a noose anyway, it is, so we'll bail 'em out 'n send 'em to extinguish them enemies of yours. Doin' some good for our good Doc!]]></string>
<string id="511717"><![CDATA[Fine, I'll set them free myself.]]></string>
<string id="511718"><![CDATA[No, dontcha even think about it. Like they'd ever care which of 'em jail meat is our lot and which are just random folks! You'll bail out the wrong ones… 'N then what? Eh? Now for the love of what's holy, dontcha go to Saburov with that… I know my way 'round them corpsebringer guards, all right? Ten grand, Doc. That's all that's required from you. And no bargainin', 'tis not a good time to bargain. I've said my word 'n shown you my price tag.]]></string>
<string id="511719"><![CDATA[I'll think about that.]]></string>
<string id="511720"><![CDATA[Anna, the precious lil' singin' bird of ours, has been so lively 'n so kickin' lately! Now she wants to bail my villain folks out of jail—and the bail's supposed to be real fat, it is, so she must know where to get a lotta monies. Ten lives are worth at least some coins, eh? Even them villain lives. The lovely beaut must be in a serious need of a hit on someone, I figure.]]></string>
<string id="511721"><![CDATA[What villains are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="511722"><![CDATA[Our good lads are doin' the languishin' in the Town Hall. They got the wrong people yesterday, they did… missed the point completely. And Anna, the dove of love that she is, is all up and ready to pay real gold for 'em captive villains—only to have 'em do her biddin'. And the dove of love is right, she is! We'll dance to the tune of the lad—or lass—who shells out the coin. That is what gratitude means.]]></string>
<string id="511723"><![CDATA[Let them just serve the time there for a while, what's the rush?]]></string>
<string id="511724"><![CDATA[So rumour has it there's an inquisitor up 'n comin' straight towards our lil' town, eh? Well, I don't have the guts to stand up to an inquisitor—and I definitely won't have any after he's done with us lot. Neither will my lads. We'd rather die of an honest bullet straight between our eyes than expire on a torture rack after a week. Whaddyathink?]]></string>
<string id="511725"><![CDATA[I think that there's always punishment after a crime.]]></string>
<string id="511726"><![CDATA[How about I bail your villains out?]]></string>
<string id="511727"><![CDATA[You'd have our most eternal gratitude, Doc, kind services on our part included. We'd rather do your biddin' than die tryin'… to execute the stupid wench's revenge.]]></string>

<string id="511729"><![CDATA[Ten thousand, Doc. I'm doin' you a favour here, 'tis just half the sum—I'll pay the rest from my own pocket. Human life comes kinda cheap these days, dontcha agree?]]></string>

<string id="511739"><![CDATA[That's for sure.]]></string>
<string id="511740"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="511741"><![CDATA[Tonight the patrols were grabbing anyone who looked even remotely suspicious; two dozen people were arrested just for having a knife or other weapon in their possession. Many were taken for not giving out Yaklakh's accomplices. Others—for looting the dead or their homes.]]></string>
<string id="511742"><![CDATA[How many people have been arrested?]]></string>
<string id="511743"><![CDATA[What will happen to these people?]]></string>
<string id="511744"><![CDATA[I don't know for sure, but since the Town Hall's cellar is stuffed to the brim, I'll hazard a guess and estimate the number to be around a hundred. The cells are so crowded that there's no room to lie down.]]></string>
<string id="511745"><![CDATA[Almost all of them are innocent; there's no direct evidence that prove otherwise. They're awaiting the judgement of an inquisitor, who's bound to arrive here very soon—tomorrow night, I think, or early on the next day. But since it's going to be either Orff or Karminsky, I wouldn't expect much lenience.]]></string>
<string id="511746"><![CDATA[How do you know this?]]></string>
<string id="511747"><![CDATA[Why are you so sure of their innocence?]]></string>
<string id="511748"><![CDATA[There are Executors guarding them. Distributing water among the prisoners and the like.]]></string>
<string id="511749"><![CDATA[What do you personally make of all this?]]></string>
<string id="511750"><![CDATA[Because the patrolmen would have killed anyone proven guilty—however tenuous the accusation—during the arrest. If they didn't feel in the right ending those people's lives, then the arrested are innocent. Perhaps a few of them might just happen to be robbers, but that's pure coincidence…]]></string>
<string id="511751"><![CDATA[This is a disgrace! Rest assured that I will speak with Saburov about that.]]></string>
<string id="511752"><![CDATA[The situation is tough, and it requires definitive measures. The patrolguard did the right thing.]]></string>
<string id="511753"><![CDATA[I want to bribe the Executor guards and free some of those people. Would you be willing to help me?]]></string>
<string id="511754"><![CDATA[With pleasure. An unexpected gesture from you, though. What's your motive?]]></string>
<string id="511756"><![CDATA[Duty. I don't readily sympathize with people regardless of which side of the bars they're on, but I feel responsible for any acts committed by those with power. It is my duty to undo and compensate at least a fraction of the damage inflicted by the law enforcers' incompetence.]]></string>
<string id="511761"><![CDATA[I doubt Saburov will approve of your actions when he finds out.]]></string>
<string id="511762"><![CDATA[Very well. I'll collect as much money as I can.]]></string>
<string id="511764"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="511765"><![CDATA[The devil take a governor like that… Although I'm not sure what I would have done in his place. His position is far from enviable.]]></string>
<string id="511766"><![CDATA[That can be said about every one of us. ]]></string>
<string id="511767"><![CDATA[Will you help me free the innocent from jail?]]></string>
<string id="511769"><![CDATA[I'll present Saburov with an ultimatum. Soon he will see for himself how pointless and pernicious his idea has turned out to be. He thinks he can terrorize the people, but all he'll accomplish is to turn the people into a gang of armed thugs. By tomorrow I'll have pressed this matter and freed the innocent.]]></string>
<string id="511770"><![CDATA[They may not survive until tomorrow morning.]]></string>
<string id="511771"><![CDATA[What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="511772"><![CDATA[There was an infected person in one of the cells. The fever had already spread in there. The Executors can't even separate the sick from the healthy—so tightly is the jail crammed.]]></string>
<string id="511773"><![CDATA[What are you suggesting?]]></string>
<string id="511774"><![CDATA[The Executors guarding the prisoners happily take bribes when the governor isn't looking. They want ten thousand per person.]]></string>
<string id="511775"><![CDATA[We have barely any money left. Fifty five thousand—that's all we have left right now… Try intimidating the Executors; namedrop the Kains! Tell them we know all about their schemes. That they themselves will end up behind bars unless they let these people out of jail! ]]></string>
<string id="511776"><![CDATA[They are masked. No one has seen an Executor's face.]]></string>
<string id="511777"><![CDATA[I don't think they're going to listen. These masked people are suicide volunteers. They are not of this world. They fear nothing.]]></string>
<string id="511778"><![CDATA[Fine… Take twenty five thousand. At least bail out someone, several people. And I think I will still draft that ultimatum to Saburov. If we survive the epidemic, he and us, I swear we'll remind him of all this!  ]]></string>
<string id="511779"><![CDATA[I thank you.]]></string>
<string id="511780"><![CDATA[I myself intend to frighten him with the prospect of the Inquisitor's wrath. He will have to account for his actions to superior authorities one way or the other.]]></string>
<string id="511781"><![CDATA[Several dozen innocent people have been thrown in jail. An even greater number have simply been killed in the streets. But those, at least, were robbers and looters… These poor other people got locked up just because patrolmen didn't like their faces! ]]></string>
<string id="511782"><![CDATA[Who is in jail?]]></string>
<string id="511783"><![CDATA[First there were mass arrests because of yesterday's act of sabotage. They took everyone who had taken part in breaking the water supply—even those who they thought could benefit from the act in some way. That is how several selfless volunteers ended up in jail for distributing water…]]></string>
<string id="511784"><![CDATA[As if the rest wasn't enough.]]></string>
<string id="511785"><![CDATA[You'll be even less pleased to find out those people were arrested on your authority. It was claimed you were the one who had discovered the roots of this conspiracy, and that those roots turned out to be quite sprawling... ]]></string>
<string id="511786"><![CDATA[This is absurd…]]></string>
<string id="511787"><![CDATA[And finally, they arrested poor souls caught searching dead bodies—and the buildings already gutted by marauders. Including brothers taking lockets from their dead sisters, and homeowners returning to the ashes of their homes…]]></string>
<string id="511788"><![CDATA[I've heard enough. Saburov will pay for this dearly.]]></string>
<string id="511789"><![CDATA[I'm sure patrolmen abusing their power are to blame. Saburov most certainly knows nothing about this. I will talk to him and restore justice.]]></string>
<string id="511790"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="511791"><![CDATA[I guess I'm going to see my brother soon enough.]]></string>
<string id="511792"><![CDATA[I'm sorry I couldn't set all the prisoners free.]]></string>
<string id="511793"><![CDATA[Ah, that's what is troubling you… Frankly, I think you shouldn't have interfered, no matter how merciful and compassionate your actions were. These victims of false justice are now besotted by what has happened to them. Not to mention those affected by the echo of the persecution—all these exaggerated, distorted rumours of the governor's abuse of power…]]></string>
<string id="511794"><![CDATA[Is there some double meaning to this?]]></string>
<string id="511795"><![CDATA[You think riots are coming?]]></string>
<string id="511796"><![CDATA[I'm positive that a law-abiding citizen who was falsely accused of robbery will soon reach for the knife. There's nothing left for him to fear… The townsfolk spend their every waking hour in waiting for a seed of painful death to sprout within them. Do you think these people will be scared of the truncheons carried by the town guard?]]></string>

And now he adores her! So, she's disappeared, huh?]]></string>
<string id="511902"><![CDATA[So she's a dancer?]]></string>
<string id="511903"><![CDATA[Yes. Try your luck asking around in the pub. She used to have a side job there—nightly, keeping it secret from her foster father. The new outbreak may have caught her right there; perhaps she was unable to get home before dawn like she usually does…]]></string>
<string id="511904"><![CDATA[You told me he's filthy rich. Why didn't he give her pocket money?]]></string>
<string id="511905"><![CDATA[She did this for pleasure, you see. She enjoyed dancing naked and drinking the thick twyrine which flows like water there. I doubt the Hunchback would allow her all this.]]></string>

<string id="511907"><![CDATA[The Hunchback has given me money in advance, but I couldn't save the girl. She has caught the infection accidentally... and then the Ripper's knife got her.

<string id="512022"><![CDATA[Nothing, apart from what I'm saying. Any crime warrants punishment. And what I did was a crime, regardless of what good intentions I may have had. Here, take the vaccine. I'm going to see Georgiy.]]></string>
<string id="512023"><![CDATA[That's suicide.]]></string>
<string id="512024"><![CDATA[I did what had to be done, but I won't spend the rest of my days trying not to look the Kains in the eye. Come on, take it—I want you to have my treasures. I won't need them anymore.]]></string>
<string id="512025"><![CDATA[All right, give me the vaccine—and go. I'll make sure to put in a good word for you.]]></string>
<string id="512027"><![CDATA[Do you know what happened in the Cathedral? ]]></string>
<string id="512030"><![CDATA[Yes. Saburov insists it could have been either Lara or Yulia. I'm sure both are innocent though; either Anna Angel or a criminal harbourer called Aspity must be the culprit. Am I correct in assuming you must be familiar with both of those ladies?]]></string>
<string id="512031"><![CDATA[That doesn't feel right.]]></string>
<string id="512032"><![CDATA[Well, you've got your ultimate proof—a specimen of infected blood. Go ahead and compare it against their samples.]]></string>
<string id="512033"><![CDATA[What are your grounds to suspect them?]]></string>
<string id="512034"><![CDATA[They are outsiders. They wish us ill.]]></string>
<string id="512035"><![CDATA[I'll check their blood up, but this is nonsense.]]></string>
<string id="512036"><![CDATA[So yesterday you managed to capture this disease? Or so I've heard, anyway. The town is abuzz with horrifying rumours of people being dissected alive… obviously, I don't believe those. The more dangerous kind of rumours are, it turns out, those about you acquiring a sample of infected blood...]]></string>
<string id="512037"><![CDATA[How so?]]></string>
<string id="512038"><![CDATA[An Inquisitor arrives tomorrow. It seems to me that someone wants to dispose of several young women before his coming. Presently the sword of justice hangs suspended above Yulia and Lara. They have been arrested, on Saburov's authority. But Vlad Olgimsky hasn't been idle either. If the girls survive until tomorrow, the Inquisitor will establish the truth, but… someone is eager to get ahead of him.]]></string>

<string id="512043"><![CDATA[Ohh... There was a fight in the Ring—the one at the edge of the Crude Sprawl. I just couldn't keep myself from having a peep... Five men were fighting there against two butchers. There was bread at stake. The butchers won and started tearing them losers apart. And then, bam, one of them falls down clutching his belly, and then another! ]]></string>
<string id="512044"><![CDATA[The shabnak! The lucid-skinned ghost, I told you before! This is it, I'm sure this it is. It's kind of bodiless—and it killed a man just by looking at him. We have to catch it! ]]></string>
<string id="512045"><![CDATA[Where did it go? ]]></string>
<string id="512046"><![CDATA[It's somewhere near the Abattoir! I was going to run looking for you at once, but luckily I stumbled upon a courier. Right now it's probably heading east, towards the Rotten Field! ]]></string>
<string id="512047"><![CDATA[Killed a man by looking at him? How did that happen? ]]></string>
<string id="512048"><![CDATA[What does the carrier have to do with this?]]></string>
<string id="512049"><![CDATA[The pale shabnak, glowing like a ghost, was hiding by the Abattoir, staring right at them butchers. It just... radiated hatred, you know! Its mug was all twisted with spite... Then it started digging around. That was it, for sure! And it's still hiding close about! Go catch it or it'll get away! ]]></string>
<string id="512050"><![CDATA[And how am I supposed to catch it? ]]></string>
<string id="512051"><![CDATA[All right, I'll go have a look at your ghost... ]]></string>
<string id="512052"><![CDATA[So, have you caught the carrier?]]></string>
<string id="512053"><![CDATA[Do you know where Clara is? ]]></string>
<string id="512054"><![CDATA[But that's exactly who I'm talking about! Except she turned out to not be Clara at all. Clara's a saint, and that shabnak's just a twin of hers! So you didn't catch her... I think this is your turn-tail moment. You have to run. She's looking for you. ]]></string>
<string id="512055"><![CDATA[Why would I run from her? It's she who seems to be running from me.]]></string>
<string id="512056"><![CDATA[No! She's looking for you—she told that to Grace and Murky. I'll find him, she said, and there'll be no mercy... That's the exact words, "no mercy." She can kill you with a single stare. You look into her eyes—and an hour later you're sick. Like, bam—and there you go.]]></string>
<string id="512057"><![CDATA[Rubbish. Where can I find Clara? ]]></string>
<string id="512058"><![CDATA[It's not a good idea, I'm telling you... All right. If you want to see her that bad, just wait a bit—and she'll find you herself.]]></string>

<string id="512061"><![CDATA[Who told you all this nonsense? Huh? ]]></string>
<string id="512062"><![CDATA[It's common knowledge that demons kill by gaze and touch—and so does Clara. You ask anyone, there's been a ton of witnesses. She's killed a whole bunch of people since morning. ]]></string>
<string id="512063"><![CDATA[I've heard precisely the opposite: that she has a healing touch. How would you explain that paradox?]]></string>
<string id="512064"><![CDATA[You got me there... But none of the people I've asked has ever seen her heal others. They've seen her kill though.]]></string>
<string id="512065"><![CDATA[Where can I find her?]]></string>
<string id="512066"><![CDATA[So what do you think, is that shabnak still hiding near the Abattoir? I should go have a look…]]></string>

<string id="512088"><![CDATA[I feel a powerful surge of lifeforce. How strange! I expected to be overcome with it on the first day—when Simon died. But it's only happening now... Time to begin! ]]></string>

<string id="512090"><![CDATA[Nothing of importance... I love seeing how unexpectedly, peculiarly, and precisely every omen, prediction, and foretelling comes true. It's time for me to begin fulfilling my duty. Seems like my time has come, Bachelor Dankovsky!]]></string>
<string id="512091"><![CDATA[What are you going to do? ]]></string>

<string id="512094"><![CDATA[Yes. Everything will change tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="512095"><![CDATA[The firestarters are planning to attack the Termitary! Did you know that?]]></string>
<string id="512096"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="512097"><![CDATA[They want to burn out the infection—they believe that is where it's crawling from. You can hear most horrible rumours about the Termitary these days. And my father doesn't even want to move a finger! ]]></string>
<string id="512098"><![CDATA[He could probably take advantage of the arson if someone was to set the Termitary afire.]]></string>
<string id="512099"><![CDATA[Do not say so! Oh, I really, really want to believe that… that Father has nothing to do with this terrible plan.]]></string>
<string id="512100"><![CDATA[How did you find out about it? ]]></string>
<string id="512101"><![CDATA[My brother somehow did. He seems to care—truly. He is dying to stop them personally—but he doesn't yet know how. I only hope there will be no dying…]]></string>

<string id="512105"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="512106"><![CDATA[What exterminators?]]></string>
<string id="512107"><![CDATA[The arsonists who have been terrorizing the town. Mad fanatics gathered by Var the usurer. He's a former fire eater or firefighter or something; it didn't take him long to gather a bunch of similarly insane maniacs. He's sworn to burn the disease out with fire.]]></string>
<string id="512108"><![CDATA[Well, you can't stop the assault itself. But the informers who reported that to my… to me, said that at ten o'clock Var the hunchback and a few others will be around there to scout out the area and look for a way to pry open the barricaded entrance.]]></string>
<string id="512109"><![CDATA[Did you mean to say they reported to your father?]]></string>
<string id="512110"><![CDATA[No... to a partner of mine.]]></string>
<string id="512111"><![CDATA[Somehow I still think you meant your father. The informers told him of the upcoming assault and he agreed to turn a blind eye on it. Is that correct?]]></string>
<string id="512112"><![CDATA[Yes. But it's no concern of yours.]]></string>
<string id="512113"><![CDATA[To find out who killed the immortal Simon Kain? The dead man's own family may not want it more than I do! I have an abiding desire to punish the murderer, to eradicate them, no matter if they were acting on their own account or at the behest of the Powers That Be! Whoever they were, they picked the moment far too well...]]></string>
<string id="512114"><![CDATA[My gentle associate, my selfless advisor Isidor Burakh was the last person to see Simon Kain alive. If it wasn't for Burakh's guidance, I never would have come to this backwoods domain. All the more reason to start my pursuit with him.]]></string>
<string id="512115"><![CDATA[Isidor Burakh was murdered. The local authorities have sealed off his house. Alexander Saburov, the head of the Saburov family, has taken control of all proceedings regarding law and order in the town. The Saburovs are one of the three families that govern the town and Alexander was the person to take immediate measures after the discovery of Isidor's body.]]></string>
<string id="512116"><![CDATA[If this Yulia Lyuricheva is genuinely capable of rational thought, then she is more astute than the majority of her contemporaries in this town. There are those who would believe that if I am unable to pinpoint the murderer by nightfall, then I am destined to become the next victim. If my encounter with death is so inevitable, then I should prepare myself for it. As ludicrous as it may be, the thought sends a chill down my spine.]]></string>
<string id="512117"><![CDATA[It is unlikely that Simon's murderer had broken into the thespian's house. Her gaze may be unkind but she isn't guilty of killing Simon either. If I am going to help her dispose of the body, I will have to come to a covert agreement with Grace, the cemetery caretaker, and hope that she is a child capable of keeping a secret.]]></string>
<string id="512118"><![CDATA[*** It is done. The gravediggers will help Anna bury the corpse.]]></string>
<string id="512119"><![CDATA["Version: The Beastlike Fugitive"]]></string>
<string id="512120"><![CDATA[*** She who gives shelter to runaway workmen will lead the butcher deep into the Steppe. May this be comforting enough for kind-hearted Eva.]]></string>
<string id="512121"><![CDATA[*** I was unable to fulfil Eva's request.]]></string>
<string id="512122"><![CDATA[*** I had to kill the butcher. Olgimsky's son, Vlad the Younger, will surely appreciate this turn of events.]]></string>
<string id="512123"><![CDATA[*** Killing people serves no purpose. Even if it is requested by someone who belongs to a family in power.]]></string>
<string id="512124"><![CDATA[*** I doubt I would be able to deal with a brute of such ferocity.]]></string>
<string id="512125"><![CDATA["Version: The Many-Legged Fugitive"]]></string>
<string id="512126"><![CDATA[What kind of games are the local children playing? Lara is worried about them. Or she is worried about the mysterious "shmowders" they seem to have discovered. It would put her mind at ease if I could get my hands on it and wrest it away from them. I know where they keep it. I can see the stash from my window in the Stillwater; in a house by the staircase ruin.]]></string>
<string id="512127"><![CDATA[The children had already looted the cache. Now the poison is out on the streets; dozens of packages of it. I've got a sample of the "shmowder". Lara would be happy to take a look at it.]]></string>
<string id="512128"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="512129"><![CDATA[*** The "shmowder" turned out to be a lethal mixture of powerful medicants. Lara was smart to burn it, but I can't help feeling like I should have kept it. The children were adamant that these shmowders are absolutely essential in some cases.]]></string>
<string id="512130"><![CDATA[*** I decided to keep the poisonous "shmowder" for myself. I have a strange feeling that it might be useful soon enough.]]></string>
<string id="512131"><![CDATA[I am following in Isidor's wake, certain that the trail of his footsteps will lead me to the Crucible. There is little doubt in my mind that Isidor was well acquainted with each and every family in power, but it was Olgimsky that held Isidor's leash; a relationship rooted in unbreakable familial loyalty. It is with the Olgimskys that I must make my next destination.]]></string>
<string id="512132"><![CDATA[The ruling families should stand together in the face of a common threat. Saburov should be granted the full extent of governing authority, but the families are not yet convinced that the plague is spreading. This obstacle is not insurmountable, however. If only I knew what it was that scared Anna Angel so much...]]></string>
<string id="512133"><![CDATA[In addition to tales of "the maneater", the streets are rife with rumours of strange places and suspicious houses. It occurs to me that the children—swarming in the gutters and listening in from the shadows as they do—must learn of these places firsthand. It may be worthwhile to speak with their confidant: Victoria Olgimskaya.]]></string>
<string id="512134"><![CDATA[Victoria told me of the dubious endeavours of Sticky, a street urchin. Apparently, the little rascal was quite distressed by the yield of his own exploits. If I can get my hands on him, then maybe I can shake out the location of the "Silent House".]]></string>
<string id="512135"><![CDATA[I have to enter the "Silent House" if I am to confirm that the disease that killed Simon is spreading. Who other than Bachelor Dankovsky is qualified to make that kind of verification to the local authorities? Of course, I must be careful. Rubin told me that the local drugstores are running out of immune system medication.]]></string>
<string id="512136"><![CDATA[What is this house? What is the nature of that filth, and of the inflammation that covered the poor woman's body? If the rulers require proof, then this is it. I will present Saburov with the key; a grisly memento that unlocks the secrets contained within this diseased place.]]></string>
<string id="512137"><![CDATA[My hypothesis was true. However two-faced the Powers That Be may be, their information was correct. There is an outbreak of highly contagious disease in town. Georgiy Kain and Vlad Olgimsky are at the head of the ruling families. They will need to be notified before anything else, and then I can take up my duties.]]></string>
<string id="512138"><![CDATA[*** For the time being, the power struggle between the ruling families has ceased. They have appointed Alexander Saburov as Governor and granted him full civil and judicial control over the town. As such, he has declared a state of emergency. They will quarantine the town—and now everyone is looking to me to suggest a further course of action.]]></string>
<string id="512139"><![CDATA[I should flee the town while I still can. Andrey Stamatin, the architect from the Capital, is the man who can help me escape.]]></string>
<string id="512140"><![CDATA[A man of class... It was a pleasure to meet someone of my own standing here, and it would be twice the pleasure if he would agree to join me and leave this place together. It is nothing short of remarkable that the creator of the Cold Hall turned out to be my former University peer. Nonetheless, I doubt he would ever go anywhere without his brother.]]></string>
<string id="512141"><![CDATA[I will need to find a gun and enough ammunition to last me through such a long and perilous journey, if I am ever to escape this place. Rumour has it that goods of this kind—the illegal kind—can be procured from the ringleader of the local outlaws. His name is Bad Grief.]]></string>
<string id="512142"><![CDATA[It is done. The only way out of town is to sneak through the quarantine. If we can make it to the railway station, we can escape. The meeting is set to happen at ten, an hour after dark.]]></string>
<string id="512143"><![CDATA[*** Our attempt to flee the town has failed. Someone compromised our plan and the patrolmen had blockaded all possible routes out of town.]]></string>
<string id="512144"><![CDATA[*** The escape was a failure.]]></string>
<string id="512145"><![CDATA[Lara reads too much classic literature. She wants to create a shelter where her friends and intimates will be safe while the outbreak is seething through the town. Vlad the Younger, Maria Kaina, and Yulia Lyuricheva are willing to provide the wherewithal to buy all the necessary provisions, but it comes down to me to source them. I need to buy several loaves of bread (3), a few bundles of dried fish (3) and some legs of smoked meat (3).]]></string>
<string id="512147"><![CDATA["Help yourself..." The prices have indeed soared beyond reason. Even so, I have to get the provisions to the shelter. It's a necessity, and any price is a small sacrifice.]]></string>
<string id="512148"><![CDATA[*** The House of the Living will be established in Lara Ravel's mansion. From now on I will always be able to get room and board here.]]></string>
<string id="512149"><![CDATA[*** Even though Lara's request was nothing more than a grocery list, I wasn't able to help her.]]></string>
<string id="512150"><![CDATA[If I am to eradicate the enemy, I must study its habits and capture it. This will be no mean feat. As is customary, we will need to perform an autopsy on someone who has already succumbed to the Sand Plague in order to procure a specimen of infected tissue. First and foremost I need to secure Saburov's consent, lest any of the usual complications linked to working with dead bodies should arise.]]></string>
<string id="512151"><![CDATA[If I can reach an agreement with the concealers then the runaway butchers might help provide dead bodies for my autopsies. I have heard rumour of a house here, somewhere in Earth, where the criminal workers of the Abattoir go into hiding.]]></string>
<string id="512152"><![CDATA[They have no great regard for human life, it seems. Three lives were given in exchange for Olgimsky's promise to cease the persecution of the runaway tradesmen.]]></string>
<string id="512153"><![CDATA[The Skinners district is contaminated. I hope that one of the three butchers that Aspity dispatched there is able to return with a suitable specimen. There is no time to procrastinate.]]></string>
<string id="512154"><![CDATA[The body that the butcher had cut open was taken to the cemetery.]]></string>
<string id="512155"><![CDATA[The dissected body is still at the cemetery. I need to get to it before the new detachment of patrolmen arrives.]]></string>
<string id="512156"><![CDATA[*** The tissue extracted from the corpse did not contain the microbe; it perished together with the host. I have come to the conclusion that it may be possible to curb any spreading of the disease. Full isolation will be essential. Mere walls, perhaps, may offer some kind of protection. Glass walls in particular.]]></string>
<string id="512157"><![CDATA[*** I wasn't able to examine the tissue.]]></string>
<string id="512158"><![CDATA[The disappearance of Simon's body seemed to greatly trouble the Kains. Could it be that a powerful, burly man like Rubin fell victim to some mysterious body-snatcher? Maybe Victor would have some insight into where I should start my investigation.]]></string>
<string id="512159"><![CDATA[Vlad the Younger may have some more information. I need to know the place where Rubin took the body, and the locations of any other such places. I also need to ascertain whether the son of Isidor Burakh—widely known as "The Ripper"—has anything to do with it.]]></string>
<string id="512160"><![CDATA[The young Olgimsky—being a respectful son, as he is—has a cunning way of concealing his failures. He has agreed to provide the information I need, but only if the Kains withdraw their demands from his family. Meanwhile, Victor insists that I investigate the Termitary as soon as possible.]]></string>
<string id="512161"><![CDATA[In all likelihood, the runaway butchers are hiding the body they stole in the house pinpointed by Vlad.]]></string>
<string id="512162"><![CDATA[The body has been found. Is it Simon?]]></string>
<string id="512163"><![CDATA[*** It is a bitter errand to be the bearer of bad news. Although the body has been discovered, it had been mutilated beyond all recognition. Georgiy would be thankful for any news at all, however dire it may be. Yet something does not feel right...]]></string>
<string id="512164"><![CDATA[*** I was unable to help Georgiy.]]></string>
<string id="512165"><![CDATA[Сapella requests that I find the little boy who ran off to the infected district. She wants me to take the "shmowder" from him. It is reasonable to assume that the child is to be found somewhere close to the Silent House.]]></string>
<string id="512166"><![CDATA[Apparently, I have no other choice but to test the "shmowder" myself.]]></string>
<string id="512167"><![CDATA[*** The shmowders are extremely detrimental to one's health, but they do eradicate the infection. Is this a mere coincidence, or did the children compound a cure? We will never find out...]]></string>
<string id="512168"><![CDATA[*** I was unable to help Capella.]]></string>
<string id="512169"><![CDATA[Defending the town is the primary concern. Olgimsky had plenty enough time to create several safety zones. Nonetheless, he thought it better to use Lara Ravel's mansion to isolate those who ventured into the infected areas of the town.]]></string>
<string id="512170"><![CDATA[Lara told me that the town waterworks ceased to function last night. Perhaps Vlad the Younger will be able to shed some light on the situation. He seems to be the man in the know when it comes to the town water supply.]]></string>
<string id="512171"><![CDATA[Some of the larger buildings draw their water from natural springs (the Theatre, the Cathedral). I should investigate the sanitary viability of these buildings as they may be my only available choice. If they meet the most basic requirements then I am empowered to use them for medical purposes.]]></string>
<string id="512172"><![CDATA[*** The Cathedral and the Theatre will be used as an isolation ward and as a hospital, respectively. The beak-headed Executors have taken up their duties. The masks will take care of the distribution of medicine as well as any postal deliveries. Furthermore, they will supervise compliance with the quarantine and the isolation of infected townsfolk.]]></string>
<string id="512173"><![CDATA[*** The volunteers were acting on my behalf. Until further notice, the buildings will be repurposed for necessity until the state of emergency subsides.]]></string>
<string id="512174"><![CDATA[Vlad the Younger will inspect what is left of the medicine supply. He has delegated the testing to four women; Yulia, Anna, Lara and Eva. I wonder if he appreciates that one of them may decide to test the solution on herself?]]></string>
<string id="512175"><![CDATA[Hardly a surprise. What else could have possibly occurred to them? From here on, I will handle the matter myself. I should test the pills in a contaminated house chosen by the Executors.]]></string>
<string id="512176"><![CDATA[*** These medicaments are to be taken in volumes that could hardly be considered safe for one's health. Further to this, their effect is only temporary. The protection granted by immune system stimulants is insubstantial at best, whereas the antibiotics can slow the development of the disease and may, in some cases, destroy the infection altogether.]]></string>
<string id="512177"><![CDATA[*** I was unable to test the medicine. There is no choice but to go along with whatever conclusion the girls have reached.]]></string>
<string id="512178"><![CDATA[The governor has failed to stop the spree of outlaws that rampage the town. However, Alexander is certain that Bad Grief, the head of the warehouse smugglers, is responsible for organising their movements.]]></string>
<string id="512179"><![CDATA[Bad Grief insists that he is innocent. Even if there is not a grain of truth to it, we will be able to use the villains feud for our own ends. In the meantime, it wouldn't hurt to tell Saburov about Barley's secret hideout.]]></string>
<string id="512180"><![CDATA[The confrontation was a failure; the patrolmen suffered a brutal defeat. However, they did succeed in slaying many of the barbers in the attempt. The underworld is awash with blood. If there was ever a perfect moment to storm Barley's lair and emerge victorious then this may well be it.

<string id="512249"><![CDATA[That's more like it. So what do you think the backstory was?]]></string>
<string id="512250"><![CDATA[Was there any particularly notable backstory? I'm deadly tired of all these people. They're inhuman. They tell the future, believe in walking zombies, and die in all manners of painfully abnormal ways.]]></string>
<string id="512251"><![CDATA[Your line of thinking is obviously fallacious—and I was implying something rather mundane.

<string id="512253"><![CDATA[I have a distinct suspicion she was made to die.]]></string>

<string id="512262"><![CDATA[Did she say why we would do such a thing?]]></string>
<string id="512263"><![CDATA[No. Can it possibly be true?]]></string>
<string id="512264"><![CDATA[Of course not. I won't have you thinking that our family started killing people in order to resurrect Simon.]]></string>
<string id="512265"><![CDATA[Why would I ever think that?]]></string>
<string id="512266"><![CDATA[Because there is an aspect of truth to it. To be precise, it is true that I intend to bring my brother back to life. We believe that we know how his memory may be transported to Focus.]]></string>
<string id="512267"><![CDATA[I don't understand.]]></string>
<string id="512268"><![CDATA[Long story short, I am going to die. But what my death will accomplish is that the memory of my brother will persevere and protect the town forever. I will die so that anyone can come to the hall of mirrors and partake of his immortal spirit. Not quite unlike the communion they take when they visit the church.]]></string>
<string id="512269"><![CDATA[You'll have to make do without my help, I'm afraid.]]></string>
<string id="512270"><![CDATA[Indeed, Eva died because her soul was parted from her body… severed from it in the very moment Simon's memory reemerged in the Focus of The Crucible.]]></string>
<string id="512271"><![CDATA[What?]]></string>
<string id="512272"><![CDATA[That's the way things are. If someone decides to die so that someone else can live—their death will be imminent. There's nothing to be done about it, for such sacrifice has consequences of immense magnitude. This is not a game. And this is exactly how Eva had died.]]></string>

<string id="512279"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="512280"><![CDATA[They have something to do with reincarnation.]]></string>
<string id="512281"><![CDATA[Since his childhood, my brother Georgiy had had rather simplistic views on the connection between the human body and the soul. Disregarding the opinions of theologians and philosophers, and ignoring serious studies on the subject, he worked out a doctrine of his own. Try to imagine our shock when it turned out to be true.]]></string>
<string id="512282"><![CDATA[Tell me about it.]]></string>
<string id="512283"><![CDATA[We don't understand it ourselves. This necrosophy was probably the only area in which Georgiy had surpassed his great brother. No one knows why, but his recipes for communicating with the dead did work. All this terminology—"Memory", "the Focus"—is of his coinage.]]></string>
<string id="512284"><![CDATA[Go on… What is he planning now?]]></string>
<string id="512285"><![CDATA[The Focus of The Crucible doesn't fit Simon. It's too small. Simon cannot live in there for long, and there is another circumstance… Well, it's no longer important. The Focus of The Crucible is like a house chapel. While what Simon needs is a cathedral.]]></string>
<string id="512286"><![CDATA[I don't suppose you're talking about the town's Cathedral—or are you?]]></string>
<string id="512287"><![CDATA[Of course not. I'm talking about the Polyhedron. Georgiy intends to transfer his deceased brother's soul there. He will have to die himself in order to achieve that. Your imagination must already be painting horrific and mesmerizing images—of dead Georgiy walking towards the Polyhedron, hands outstretched, dragging his feet, driven by Simon's spirit...]]></string>
<string id="512288"><![CDATA[You've guessed my impression very well. ]]></string>
<string id="512289"><![CDATA[Perhaps that's what it would look like in the higher spheres. In the world of ideas, if you will. I will, however, disappoint you. It will happen quietly and inconspicuously. No one will see a thing. Georgiy will be lying in his room throughout the process. Simon's Memory will be transferred to the Polyhedron with the power of his mind.]]></string>
<string id="512290"><![CDATA[Of his imagination, you mean?]]></string>
<string id="512291"><![CDATA[I meant exactly as I said. I would even risk supposing that Georgiy will die from the collosal strain that this work will have put on him. From the concentration of will, intellect, and all his mental powers.]]></string>

<string id="512303"><![CDATA[No way… I thought he was at the frontline?]]></string>
<string id="512304"><![CDATA[He's not. As soon as the Powers That Be found out about the epidemic, he was transferred to the rear.

<string id="512427"><![CDATA[The earth was dumped into a ravine that, for a long time, used to serve as the Guzzle's embankment. That was actually precisely when and how the enbankment was built.]]></string>
<string id="512428"><![CDATA[Oh, all right. I lied to you. Obviously I'm not endeavouring to find oil here. The well is my first step towards a lifelong dream; an archaeological excavation. I'm interested in the ancient culture of the Steppe peoples. I'm studying strata. Layers.]]></string>
<string id="512429"><![CDATA[By the way, where did the taboo come from? Why is digging wells forbidden?]]></string>
<string id="512430"><![CDATA[So what are you looking for?]]></string>
<string id="512432"><![CDATA[It's not exactly taboo… According to a local legend, it's simply pointless—you won't find any water. "The blood of the earth is hidden from the people." That's from one of the local myths. And it's true: we've dug about a hundred meters down and found no moisture. Fascinating, isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="512433"><![CDATA[Where do the springs come from then?]]></string>
<string id="512434"><![CDATA[Oh, it's another curious phenomenon; I can't claim to be a specialist in this, though. But the builders, the ones who erected the Termitary and the stone houses in Earth, maintained that the springs are somehow enclosed in layers of solid compacted clay with sand deposits, through which water is supplied as if through pipes.]]></string>
<string id="512435"><![CDATA[But why the artificial wells then?]]></string>
<string id="512483"><![CDATA[Move along, doctor. The prisoners are not available for communication.]]></string>

<string id="512485"><![CDATA[I'm in. Here you go.]]></string>

<string id="512491"><![CDATA[Here. Have some money. In advance. I've got more where it came from. Just bring my Willow back, bring her back!]]></string>
<string id="512492"><![CDATA[Wait for me here. ]]></string>
<string id="512493"><![CDATA[Is there any way to stop the assault?]]></string>
<string id="512494"><![CDATA[Why won't your father handle this matter?]]></string>
<string id="512495"><![CDATA[Enough! I've told you already—whatever my father does, I refuse to call his decisions in question. He is troubled enough as it is. Particularly troubled by something that is actually supposed to be your job; the search for the carrier. If the impending assault stirs your imagination so much, go ahead and talk to my father in person.]]></string>
<string id="512496"><![CDATA[So what is it that you want from me? ]]></string>
<string id="512497"><![CDATA[They're going to gather at the Termitary's entrance after dark. When the hunchback approaches the hallway, he needs to be shot. I think it would be best to lie in wait right there. All this time I've been looking for someone brave enough to do this for a sizable reward...]]></string>
<string id="512498"><![CDATA[A reward from your father?]]></string>
<string id="512499"><![CDATA[...No. From me personally. Ten thousand. ]]></string>
<string id="512500"><![CDATA[All right. I'll talk to your father. ]]></string>

<string id="512502"><![CDATA[Bachelor? ]]></string>
<string id="512503"><![CDATA[Do you know the arsonists are planning to attack the Termitary? ]]></string>
<string id="512504"><![CDATA[Let them plan. I hope they'll do without me wishing them good luck.]]></string>
<string id="512505"><![CDATA[Don’t you want to stop them? ]]></string>
<string id="512506"><![CDATA[Even if they had catapults, they wouldn't be able to damage these walls. The Termitary can withstand straight-line artillery bombardment. ]]></string>
<string id="512507"><![CDATA[What if they get inside? ]]></string>
<string id="512508"><![CDATA[Then they'll regret it bitterly. For goodness sake... Why don't you get back to looking for the carrier, doctor? If we figure out who the bitch is, tomorrow you will leave the town a winner, and the inquisitor will take the townsfolk's lives into his skilled hands. Including the lives of the Termitary's inhabitants.]]></string>
<string id="512509"><![CDATA[What you're saying is you're planning to do exactly nothing, am I correct?]]></string>
<string id="512510"><![CDATA[I won't move a finger. And what could I possbily undertake? All my servants, mercenaries, and household members who still have the courage and the strength to meddle with this sort of affairs... well. Some of them are dead, others have joined the bandits.]]></string>
<string id="512511"><![CDATA[Bandits? This is new. ]]></string>
<string id="512512"><![CDATA[My household is not the only source of those—the Kain's fellows have started a gang, too. They're mugging marauders. Despair is making everyone grab their knife. They're fighting each other already…]]></string>

<string id="512517"><![CDATA[Yes, the one and only. Are you surprised?]]></string>
<string id="512518"><![CDATA[You… our family shall never forget this, doctor. It was a matter of honour. Here is the promised reward. Aside from that, the Olgimskys'… younger generation is forever in your debt.]]></string>
<string id="512519"><![CDATA[Very well. What's done is done.]]></string>
<string id="512520"><![CDATA[I'll kill this hunchback arsonist all right. His crowd is starting to become… annoying.]]></string>
<string id="512521"><![CDATA[And the reward will be forthcoming, kind doctor! I beg you to stop the assault on the Termitary! I understand that it's an incredibly dangerous undertaking that will demand that you…]]></string>
<string id="512522"><![CDATA[Oh, stop it. I know the risks involved. In the past few days I've learned to handle a pistol no less nimbly than any regular gunslinger.]]></string>

<string id="512524"><![CDATA[You are too sensitive, Victoria. ]]></string>
<string id="512525"><![CDATA[I've talked to him already.]]></string>
<string id="512526"><![CDATA[I failed to stop the hunchback. Fortunately, the Termitary still stands.]]></string>

<string id="512557"><![CDATA[We don't know for sure if those people are truly innocent. What if there are thieves, murderers, or looters among them? What if we let an unspeakable villain out? The price includes the risk-taking.]]></string>

<string id="512616"><![CDATA[I don't know. Any ideas?]]></string>
<string id="512617"><![CDATA[The governor got it into his head that Burakh has found the maneater. They had a meeting yesterday.

Big Vlad believes Burakh's efforts to have been of great service; they can compare blood samples now and find the carrier.]]></string>

<string id="512656"><![CDATA[On what grounds?]]></string>
<string id="512657"><![CDATA[Most solid. Items belonging to them were found inside the Cathedral. Lara was even identified—those few who were still able to speak mentioned her name.]]></string>
<string id="512658"><![CDATA[She is the prime suspect.]]></string>
<string id="512659"><![CDATA[Tragic. But at least it makes our jobs easier. The maneater rumours turned out to be true. If we catch her, things will get better. I don't want to believe that it's Lara or Yulia, but the evidence is too obvious to just let them walk, isn't it?]]></string>

<string id="512708"><![CDATA[Yesterday she visited your isolation ward... That is, our Cathedral. How did she pass the blockade? A mystery... After her visit the Cathedral turned into a morgue.

<string id="512730"><![CDATA[Your blood is strange, even though there's no horned bacteria in it. Still, you know more than you let out. Your heart is black... ]]></string>
<string id="512731"><![CDATA[Aspity, you are accused of being a maneater. They'll come for you soon. ]]></string>
<string id="512732"><![CDATA[Oh, you're just reeking of suspicious things!]]></string>
<string id="512733"><![CDATA[Yulia, you stand accused of a crime. Saburov wants to publically announce that it was you who visited the Cathedral. ]]></string>
<string id="512734"><![CDATA[Your blood is clean, Yulia. It looks like I was wrong...]]></string>
<string id="512735"><![CDATA[Good day, Lara. The governor believes it's... ]]></string>
<string id="512736"><![CDATA[You're clean. Now you know for sure that there's no reason for you to hide your eyes.]]></string>
<string id="512737"><![CDATA[So? So? Have you met the Changeling already?]]></string>
<string id="512738"><![CDATA[Who?!]]></string>
<string id="512739"><![CDATA[Changeling! The Changeling! She's the spitting image of me! Only she's a ghost, a demon, she is not at all—not human in the slightest! A foul, evil killer—pretending to be me on purpose! I'm looking for her, looking for her everywhere! It was she who brought the disease. On purpose!]]></string>
<string id="512740"><![CDATA[What in the world are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="512741"><![CDATA[Yes, yes! She spreads the disease from house to house! That's how it gets through walls, people open their doors to her willingly! Those gullible children, they think it's me! I only found out today! People are attracted to her, they want her to lay a hand on their lips, on their heart, they want to touch her...]]></string>
<string id="512742"><![CDATA[You're talking about yourself! Stop trying to pull the wool over my eyes!]]></string>
<string id="512743"><![CDATA[Ask anyone—she's everywhere, she follows my every step, pretending to be me! Every time I get home I even have to prove myself to my dear, my lovely Katerina! That thing is an evil demon moulded of spit and bones! She'll kill us… she'll kill us all!]]></string>
<string id="512744"><![CDATA[What the hell... They threw you out, and now you are here? ]]></string>
<string id="512745"><![CDATA[I have—just now. Come closer, sweet girl.]]></string>

<string id="512750"><![CDATA[I've taken a look at your blood. It is the strangest blood I've ever seen... but it doesn't contain the thing I was looking for. Could I have lost this battle?]]></string>
<string id="512751"><![CDATA[And who are you then? ]]></string>
<string id="512752"><![CDATA[Cut with the gabbling!]]></string>
<string id="512753"><![CDATA[I am Clara, the instrument of the miraculous power that is beyond the realm of humans. They call me the Harbinger Angel!]]></string>
<string id="512754"><![CDATA[There is no such angel. ]]></string>
<string id="512755"><![CDATA[How do you know? Who are you to speak of high heavens, you, the man that is stuck in the dimness of rebellious arts and the horrors of heretical teachings! Step away from me, Bachelor! By the power that's been bestowed upon me, step away!]]></string>
<string id="512756"><![CDATA[You have no power over me. ]]></string>
<string id="512757"><![CDATA[Oh, come on.]]></string>
<string id="512758"><![CDATA[All right now, calm down! You're hysterical! ]]></string>
<string id="512759"><![CDATA[Give me your hand. ]]></string>
<string id="512760"><![CDATA[Please, please catch this loathesome creature! She's scared of you! She knows you've already almost killed her... Help us... ]]></string>
<string id="512761"><![CDATA[Don't make me resort to brute force. I'm going to take a look at your blood now.]]></string>
<string id="512762"><![CDATA[But you don't have a single needle... How are you going to puncture my arm? ]]></string>
<string id="512763"><![CDATA[You're right... How in the world did this happen?]]></string>
<string id="512764"><![CDATA[I don't know... I didn't take anything... I'm not a thief, never have I ever taken anything that didn't belong to me… But if you find some—do come, do come back to me. I'll be waiting. I'll show you my blood. Just catch and destroy that creature!]]></string>
<string id="512765"><![CDATA[Fine... But don't you try to avoid me.]]></string>
<string id="512766"><![CDATA[Epileptic, are you... You're staying here on the responsibility of governor Saburov and his spouse Katerina.]]></string>
<string id="512767"><![CDATA[Yes. Will you kill her? She's after you too! And about to get you... You only managed to avoid it until now due to a single little mistake!]]></string>
<string id="512768"><![CDATA["She" who?]]></string>
<string id="512769"><![CDATA[Hi Clara.]]></string>
<string id="512770"><![CDATA[I hope this Changeling gets caught soon! What a despicable creature, a product of the Steppe's insanity… made of bones and clay.]]></string>
<string id="512771"><![CDATA[Do you know that the suspect is one of the young local noblewomen?]]></string>
<string id="512772"><![CDATA[Who is it standing there?]]></string>
<string id="512773"><![CDATA[The girl? That's not her. How could you think that! Don't you see? This is my foster daughter, Clara. ]]></string>
<string id="512774"><![CDATA[That's the one I'm looking for. ]]></string>
<string id="512775"><![CDATA[But she's not guilty! Don't you know? She is a saint. She is helpful and kind. She heals people. She's already dragged more than a hundred men out of their graves!]]></string>
<string id="512776"><![CDATA[She was at the Cathedral.]]></string>
<string id="512777"><![CDATA[It wasn't her—it was some changeling that walks around under the guise of our sweet girl. But we drove her out, and she crept to the cemetery—the proper place for this creature! She nestles there, under the wing of the insane Grace. Our daughter can't stand her as well. ]]></string>
<string id="512778"><![CDATA[I thought you were fond of Grace—weren't you, Katerina?]]></string>
<string id="512779"><![CDATA[I need to take a sample of her blood. ]]></string>
<string id="512780"><![CDATA[Grace has gone mad. I am still very much fond of the girl—yet I cannot help being angry with her! She refuses to show me the grave that the mara's hiding in!]]></string>
<string id="512781"><![CDATA[No, never. It would be extremely impolite of us to besmirch her with suspicion! If we through our distrust offend the grace that lives within her, she will lose her miraculous abilities. No, never. She will remain here on my responsibility. My spouse and I vouch for her. ]]></string>
<string id="512782"><![CDATA[I declare this girl grounded. I assume the Town Hall and the governor's house are equally reliable in this respect. ]]></string>
<string id="512783"><![CDATA[The girl must stay here until the Inquisitor comes for her. And no miracles until Karminsky arrives.]]></string>
<string id="512784"><![CDATA[Undoubtedly.]]></string>
<string id="512785"><![CDATA[It was bitter sarcasm. ]]></string>
<string id="512786"><![CDATA[It'll be Orff, not Karminsky.]]></string>
<string id="512787"><![CDATA[Orff? Really? ]]></string>
<string id="512788"><![CDATA[Yes. Karminsky was recalled—he's needed in the field. As far as I understood, a certain delicate operation requires a hanging judge and a punisher.]]></string>
<string id="512789"><![CDATA[How in the world is Orff unsuitable for this…?]]></string>
<string id="512790"><![CDATA[There is no carrier. It's a myth. ]]></string>
<string id="512791"><![CDATA[Where's the girl? ]]></string>
<string id="512792"><![CDATA[Gone already! She darted straight after you as soon as the door closed behind your back. It didn't even take her a minute. I was positive she went with you…]]></string>
<string id="512793"><![CDATA[But she was your responsibility! She was... heavens know what it was.]]></string>
<string id="512794"><![CDATA[This cannot be... The thought never occurred to me... ]]></string>
<string id="512795"><![CDATA[Soon you'll be the one to stand before the the Inquisitor. ]]></string>

<string id="512801"><![CDATA[Did you make that up yourself?]]></string>
<string id="512802"><![CDATA[No. I was taught. A mara girl is looking for you. Beware…]]></string>
<string id="512803"><![CDATA[Clara? ]]></string>
<string id="512804"><![CDATA[Yes! But you don't need her; you need her twin sister. She'll help you, she helps everybody... Clara is nice, the mara is evil. The mara is a shabnak. A marad! A nastail!]]></string>
<string id="512805"><![CDATA[Where's Clara? ]]></string>
<string id="512806"><![CDATA[What do you need Clara for? You need the nastail that's pretending to be Clara. They're easy to tell apart.]]></string>

<string id="512808"><![CDATA[Hush! Shut up!]]></string>
<string id="512809"><![CDATA[The mara can't talk. Her words are like little spits of dirt. Filthy! She mutters and chatters and mumbles. People don't talk like that… And earth spills out of her mouth too.]]></string>
<string id="512810"><![CDATA[Where can I find her?]]></string>
<string id="512811"><![CDATA[The mara's hiding today. Everyone's hunting her. And she's hunting you. She thinks that if she kills you, everyone will just let her go. Tee-hee...]]></string>
<string id="512812"><![CDATA[Damn it... Is there a single sane person in this town?]]></string>
<string id="512813"><![CDATA[I know, I know...]]></string>
<string id="512814"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="512815"><![CDATA[My head is splitting... ]]></string>
<string id="512816"><![CDATA[Have you seen Clara? ]]></string>
<string id="512817"><![CDATA[She's hiding—in the infected part of the town, most likely. Or maybe somewhere by the Station… A terrible person is coming from the Capital to execute her tomorrow. She wanted to hide between the carriages, then slip onto a train and leave… but didn't want to do it without saying goodbye to Murky and Sticky first.]]></string>
<string id="512818"><![CDATA[Who is the White Spectre? ]]></string>
<string id="512819"><![CDATA[It's a person of the night. He's like a dead man, only he walks—wanders around at night with his limber cat. He's almost transparent. Clara made friends with him. Said if anything bad happens to him, she'll come and bring him back to life.]]></string>
<string id="512820"><![CDATA[I killed him today. So I'll find her nearby. Thank you, Grace! ]]></string>
<string id="512821"><![CDATA[You couldn't have. He never shows himself to anybody. If you chance to see him, he'll just fade into the darkness—and he's not around during the day, he never is. Like a foggy well around the moon.]]></string>
<string id="512822"><![CDATA[Grace, does Clara have a twin sister? ]]></string>
<string id="512823"><![CDATA[Shabnak-adyr's made a habit of pretending to be Clara. She came to me once. Talked to me. I didn't realize it at first, and then I wondered—why was she so tall? So I looked down and saw it. She had no feet, just broken bones sticking out of her shoes! So scary! I was so short of breath, I ran away! And she had such an evil scowl... Laughing...]]></string>
<string id="512824"><![CDATA[And what did she say? ]]></string>
<string id="512825"><![CDATA[Lots of things. She even mentioned you. Said she was looking for you. Said she wanted to lure you into a trap. To fool the doctor. Said the doctor's not so smart… That she fooled everyone and she's going to fool him too. Turn his needles into hooks so he won't prick her hands.]]></string>
<string id="512826"><![CDATA[How horrible... ]]></string>
<string id="512827"><![CDATA[Damn... ]]></string>

<string id="512852"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="512854"><![CDATA[You look like hell, mate... So you've changed your mind and become the master of cremations after all? Is this how you want to die?]]></string>
<string id="512855"><![CDATA[Silence! Listen to my confession. I'd rather confess to you than to her... Listen—and I shall tell you of what I had managed to create... When I studied architecture, for a longest time I remained passive and didn't do or make anything at all—except observations. It always seemed to me that any house is so much more than walls, a hearth, and a roof! ]]></string>
<string id="512856"><![CDATA[But this is treachery... ]]></string>
<string id="512857"><![CDATA[It is. See—I was smart enough to take the designs of my creation to the parting.]]></string>

<string id="512859"><![CDATA[Give them to me. As a keepsake.]]></string>
<string id="512860"><![CDATA[Really?]]></string>
<string id="512861"><![CDATA[Go help your brother. Do you know that he's been arrested? He's killed several people trying to help you. ]]></string>

<string id="512865"><![CDATA[So you don't care? ]]></string>
<string id="512866"><![CDATA[No one does... ]]></string>

<string id="512871"><![CDATA[Send me the dark blue flame! I desire to burn down not in earthly, but in heavenly fire! So please, do bring me this spicy spirit! Bring me my smoky, dense, odorous sap! I want to burn myself in twyrine!]]></string>
<string id="512875"><![CDATA[Old boy! I'm thirsty, old boy. Bring me five bottles of twyrine—and you can have the designs… No one would be able to decipher them anyway. And if they do—no one would build it…]]></string>

<string id="512883"><![CDATA[No. ]]></string>
<string id="512884"><![CDATA[It's a multidimensional space. It is turned unto itself. It has no surfaces, borders, or bounds. It has no mass. It has no end.]]></string>

<string id="512886"><![CDATA[Then go and see for youself. Just let the children teach you how to get back. ]]></string>
<string id="512887"><![CDATA[But this is a sensation! A groundbreaking discovery that will turn the world upside down!]]></string>
<string id="512888"><![CDATA[The discovery is not mine. I've nothing to be proud of, really… I've stumbled across it by accident. Moreover, I don't really understand how it works. I've studied my own calculations inside out—and I still don't get it. Something's off, but what? That is the question...]]></string>
<string id="512889"><![CDATA[Well, I never... an architect of schizophrenia! ]]></string>

<string id="512898"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="512899"><![CDATA[Bachelor! I would like you to explain a certain important point to me. You have a close relationship with the Kains, do you not?]]></string>
<string id="512900"><![CDATA[Where could those blueprints be?]]></string>
<string id="512901"><![CDATA[The Kains surely know everything. Maybe they keep copies of the blueprints. After all, that chimera was built under their patronage. Let them be the ones to make excuses now.]]></string>
<string id="512902"><![CDATA[I don'think so. That structure is a product of Peter Stamatin's wild imagination… I'll speak with him.]]></string>
<string id="512904"><![CDATA[Why? It's something to be proud of, not make excuses for.]]></string>
<string id="512905"><![CDATA[I'm listening to an equal, Bachelor…]]></string>
<string id="512906"><![CDATA[Here are the blueprints. Hopefully you'll treat them with utmost care. They will probably become a bibliographical rarity even before the author passes away.]]></string>
<string id="512907"><![CDATA[Well… let us take a look at the blueprints then… What do you think?]]></string>
<string id="512908"><![CDATA[It's an absolute masterpiece.]]></string>
<string id="512909"><![CDATA[Whatever it is, it is a world-class sensation.]]></string>
<string id="512910"><![CDATA[It's rubbish. A pointless delusion conjured up by a lunatic.]]></string>

<string id="512912"><![CDATA[What is your initial opinion on the blueprints? ]]></string>
<string id="512913"><![CDATA[Is that what you think? Well, I'll have a look… Go now—and only come back here after a while. Preferrably tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="512914"><![CDATA[Just as I intended.]]></string>
<string id="512915"><![CDATA[Ugh... my initial opinion is that of amazement. As far as I understand, such a structure simply cannot hold… All of this could only work if this chamber was floating in a weightless state… Those charts are nothing but an intellectual fancy, a mindgame… like a perpetuum mobile.]]></string>
<string id="512916"><![CDATA[An apt comparison indeed.]]></string>
<string id="512917"><![CDATA[Peter said the exact same thing.]]></string>
<string id="512918"><![CDATA[So how does it all stay in balance? Especially with a thousand children inside. I don't understand.]]></string>
<string id="512919"><![CDATA[The base of the stairs is extremely strong and the materials are remarkably light. That's the townfolk's explanation.]]></string>
<string id="512920"><![CDATA[Listen, I need to study this some more… Come to me next morning. I feel that we are on the right path; this is where the catch is. Metaphysics aside… there has to be some practical reason for its existence, wouldn't you agree?]]></string>
<string id="512921"><![CDATA[I hope to live to see the morning and not die of curiosity.]]></string>
<string id="512922"><![CDATA[We have little time. Block says that the soldiers are getting restless. The Sand Plague has reached the encampments. The troops are about to riot.]]></string>
<string id="512923"><![CDATA[Hopefully, he'll be able to keep them in check for a day or two… won't he? And that's all the time we need.]]></string>
<string id="512924"><![CDATA[And what if he's not?]]></string>
<string id="512959"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="512960"><![CDATA[Oh, just the person I wanted to see! We've had quite an adventure here. My knife loves strife—it has a gripe with the type filled with tripe! So tell me, what would be best—should I drag my little brother over here to always have him by my side, or rather move to his place?]]></string>
<string id="512961"><![CDATA[That's... Grief-ese, isn't it? You're talking just like him! The type filled with what? How did you put it?]]></string>
<string id="512963"><![CDATA[…Whom did you kill?]]></string>
<string id="512964"><![CDATA[You see, my dear brother is seeing pink elephants. He's talking to bottles. The conversations seem to be enlightening, too—he mostly does the listening. And so he got it into his head… As far as I understood, he decided that he was at his limit and wanted to try his luck.]]></string>
<string id="512965"><![CDATA[Is he in a crisis? Let me guess—it started yesterday?]]></string>
<string id="512966"><![CDATA[I'll never leave my little brother again… I'll stay right by his side. And I won't let anyone come close, too—at least closer than my knife can fly!]]></string>

<string id="512972"><![CDATA[Tell him that I am turning into a Mistress. Tell him I can feel the scarlet lava.

Tell him... I feel he's with Andrey now.]]></string>
<string id="512973"><![CDATA[I will. I was going to visit Andrey anyway. ]]></string>
<string id="512974"><![CDATA[Actually, there was no reason for you to come see me today… for I am a chrysalis.]]></string>

<string id="513054"><![CDATA[The commander is Alexander Block, the war hero. The mind—and hand—behind the upcoming military reform. The Karstov Fords, the broken front…. You must've heard of him.  ]]></string>
<string id="513055"><![CDATA[…No way!]]></string>
<string id="513056"><![CDATA[It's not a sanitary army. They have neither the special equipment, nor even any weapons appropriate for the task. As a matter of fact, it's just two artillery regiments that had been marching towards the front line after performing successful maneuvers, and a hastily assigned company of sanitary flamethrower corps. Don't you find that strange?]]></string>
<string id="513057"><![CDATA[Yes. Quite.]]></string>
<string id="513058"><![CDATA[Rings any bells? Any stunning similarities that spring to your mind?]]></string>
<string id="513059"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="513060"><![CDATA[Of course there are... Block reminds me of myself. And—of you, I suppose?]]></string>
<string id="513061"><![CDATA[Isn't it convenient that Block just happened to be here by sheer coincidence! "Just conducting maneuvers nearby." A visionary of military science! Loathed by the entirety of our military's top brass! He personally received the train carrying a new long-range cannon that was being transported to the front by way of the north-western railroad. And now...]]></string>
<string id="513074"><![CDATA[Indeed. All this time there have been several watchers active in the town. At least three are known. They kept numbers, wrote down their observations. Visited homes unbeknownst to the town's rulers, disguised as corpse carriers. It was they—one of them—who sent you those daily letters.]]></string>
<string id="513075"><![CDATA[Here's what I managed to take from the watchers.]]></string>
<string id="513076"><![CDATA[How absurd! Who would need that?]]></string>
<string id="513077"><![CDATA[The Powers That Be. It was they, not the Kains, who did their best to guide you to a conclusion that would bring victory. Any false hypothesis could have been fatal. Time was too short for everyone to pursue an erroneous theory. But the most important thing is that the Power That Be knew what was about to begin here.]]></string>
<string id="513078"><![CDATA[This particular epidemic?]]></string>
<string id="513079"><![CDATA[I don't think so. Otherwise, they'd have been better prepared. I have no doubt that they are desperate to preserve this little town. No, they didn't know what exactly was going to happen here. And that's the most mind-boggling part! But they were ready for trouble—all of their emissaries came adequately informed.]]></string>
<string id="513080"><![CDATA[So the illustrous Alexander Block wasn't sent here to set up a quarantine either…]]></string>
<string id="513081"><![CDATA[I concur. Block was hastily directed here in case the town faces a… threat, that could be dealt with through military might.]]></string>
<string id="513082"><![CDATA[Informed of what?]]></string>
<string id="513083"><![CDATA[So what did the Powers That Be know?]]></string>
<string id="513084"><![CDATA[That is the mystery I'm trying to solve. That is the puzzle that's on my mind the most—rather than the origin of this strange affliction, which I'm going to leave to you, Daniil.]]></string>
<string id="513085"><![CDATA[Where shall we start?]]></string>
<string id="513086"><![CDATA[I want to study the watchers' reports. But to even obtain them I will require your help. I suspect they're under strict orders to keep me completely in the dark. Just as they did you, Bachelor, only a few days ago…]]></string>
<string id="513108"><![CDATA[A sanitary army, I suppose…]]></string>
<string id="513110"><![CDATA[Why didn't they find a simpler man for this mission?]]></string>
<string id="513111"><![CDATA[But why?]]></string>
<string id="513112"><![CDATA[To make our bright minds derive the correct solution independently of any outside sources. That's the reason. So, if I send someone for them or personally go to collect their reports, they will destroy them. They may even opt to go into hiding or commit suicide. So I ask you to act... on my behalf.]]></string>
<string id="513113"><![CDATA[If they won't give their reports to you, why would they give them to me?]]></string>
<string id="513114"><![CDATA[Your mission is over. And their lives are in danger. I believe they will try to escape my all-seeing eye before today is over.]]></string>
<string id="513115"><![CDATA[What makes you think so?]]></string>
<string id="513116"><![CDATA[I'm going to show my hand to you now. The Powers That Be and I are fighting the same enemy—but that doesn't mean we're on the same side. The emissaries know of my… feelings towards them. They expect to be slaughtered—and rightfully so. Their actions towards me will be adequate to those expectations.]]></string>
<string id="513117"><![CDATA[One of them? What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="513118"><![CDATA[It means that there is a traitor and a liar among them. They intentionally distorted the information knowing that sooner or later it was going to find its way into my hands. But we'll get to that later.]]></string>
<string id="513119"><![CDATA[What, they knew of the epidemic before it began?]]></string>
<string id="513120"><![CDATA[Very well. How will I find them?]]></string>
<string id="513121"><![CDATA[They've had to walk around a lot. To observe, to examine… They must have the appearance of those who do the dirtiest work here. An elaborate disguise. I predict that they're going to crawl out into the daylight today, no matter where they have been hiding before. ]]></string>
<string id="513122"><![CDATA[Where could they have been hiding?]]></string>
<string id="513123"><![CDATA[How should I know? I've only been here for a few hours whereas you've been here for a week. Ask the local rulers. I would suppose they're spread out evenly throughout the town. One was certainly active here in the Stone Yard, one in the Knots, and the last one in Earth.]]></string>
<string id="513124"><![CDATA[You're really well-informed, aren't you.]]></string>
<string id="513125"><![CDATA[What are you going to do while I'm looking for the watchers?]]></string>
<string id="513126"><![CDATA[I'll interrogate the members of the ruling families and many others who I deem worthy of attention. Today is local elite day. Our previous conversation ended quite abruptly when we were just getting to the most interesting part: the source. I know.]]></string>
<string id="513127"><![CDATA[I wish to ask a favour of you. I've expended significant effort convincing everyone to stay at home and not venture outside. The very air in these streets is deadly. At times I've risked my life just to avoid a worse risk…]]></string>
<string id="513128"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="513129"><![CDATA[Some favour! Do you expect me to go door to door like some delivery girl? I'm not afraid of the disease, but it does not become me! I speak to you in a friendly tone because I want us to trust each other, but to everyone else I'm an Inquisitor. Have you forgotten what kind of position that is?]]></string>
<string id="513130"><![CDATA[In that case please make sure that any person your people take outside takes immune drugs.]]></string>
<string id="513131"><![CDATA[Fine. I'll see to that. In fact, I intend to liquidate the Olgimskys' medicine stockpile and personally oversee the distribution.]]></string>
<string id="513132"><![CDATA[Very well.]]></string>
<string id="513133"><![CDATA[Just leave some for their personal use.]]></string>
<string id="513134"><![CDATA[No. We were expecting a punisher, and instead…]]></string>
<string id="513135"><![CDATA[...An angel descended? No. Personally for you, at best. My disposition is fearsome, which you will have ample opportunity to observe. There's lots of blood to spill. But I'm positive—and this is what makes me different from Karminsky—that I can keep the body count to a necessary minimum.]]></string>
<string id="513136"><![CDATA[I can't believe my luck. Yesterday I was sure everything was lost. ]]></string>
<string id="513138"><![CDATA[That comes with the line of work, I suppose.]]></string>
<string id="513139"><![CDATA[Don't jump to conclusions. I'm still a government inquisitor. You know we are sanctioned use any methods, with no concern for anything. There is no law for us but the law of efficiency in completing our current mission.]]></string>
<string id="513140"><![CDATA[Right. I know.]]></string>
<string id="513141"><![CDATA[Why was the punishment so quick?]]></string>
<string id="513143"><![CDATA[An unfortunate accident. I'm truly sorry that everything turned as it did. I was going to question the honourable Executor thoroughly tonight. Or perhaps the poor sap saw it coming, so he jumped off of his own free will. What do you think?]]></string>
<string id="513144"><![CDATA[I think poking my nose into this was a mistake.]]></string>
<string id="513150"><![CDATA[Right… let me see… Yes, that's about what I was expecting… Numbers, dates, notes. Very good. If only those seeds of truth weren't intermixed with so much chaff, this could give us a dramatic push in the right direction.]]></string>
<string id="513151"><![CDATA[Excuse me?]]></string>
<string id="513152"><![CDATA[It seems simple comparison won't be enough to figure out the false report… They all describe different things… And there might be two false ones… A pity… Daniil! We must hurry, before they are gone! Find out which one of them is which. Outsmart them.]]></string>
<string id="513153"><![CDATA[Outsmart them? How?]]></string>
<string id="513154"><![CDATA[One of them is a liar and a traitor. I suspect it was they that sent you those letters that would enrage you so and even endanger your life. One of those reports is a farewell gift from them. A false lead that will put you on a false trail.]]></string>
<string id="513155"><![CDATA[But why would they write down lies? If the Powers That Be seek to preserve the town…]]></string>
<string id="513156"><![CDATA[Because they're a traitor. We need to know which one of them. Moreover, they've been trying to get a second one on their side as well, and that one began to hesitate… Only the third one remained honest until the end.]]></string>
<string id="513157"><![CDATA[How did you find that out? ]]></string>
<string id="513158"><![CDATA[A friend gave me something before I left for this place… He knew some of the internal workings of this whole affair. And questioning Vlad Olgimsky confirmed my hypothesis. Both he and Saburov knew that there were watchers active around here.]]></string>
<string id="513159"><![CDATA[Yet they told me nothing! ]]></string>
<string id="513160"><![CDATA[They may have been intimidated into keeping silent.]]></string>
<string id="513161"><![CDATA[…And what about the Kains? Did they know?]]></string>
<string id="513162"><![CDATA[No. The Kains don't even know that the sun rises in the east—it is beneath them.]]></string>
<string id="513163"><![CDATA[Fine. How can I help you?]]></string>
<string id="513164"><![CDATA[Fine. How can I help you?]]></string>
<string id="513165"><![CDATA[Try to find out which one of them is the liar. Like in that old riddle, the traitor is sure to lie. Someone who hesitates could both lie and tell the truth. The last one will be truthful until the end—but even the truthful watcher won't be very forthcoming. Are you up to the task?]]></string>
<string id="513166"><![CDATA[Yes. I think I know how to do it.]]></string>
<string id="513167"><![CDATA[You would fare better.]]></string>
<string id="513168"><![CDATA[No. They wouldn't tell me anything at all—even if I resorted to torture. These watchers are a special breed. Different from you and me. ]]></string>
<string id="513169"><![CDATA[Very well. I'll try.]]></string>
<string id="513170"><![CDATA[One more thing. My intuition tells me that you have no room for error. These people are extremely desperate now. If you accuse the truthful watcher or the one who is still hesitating… they might react unpredictably. I know their kind. You will only have one shot.]]></string>
<string id="513171"><![CDATA[I see. You want to take the opportunity to test my mental faculties… But I don't mind that.]]></string>
<string id="513172"><![CDATA[Would it make sense to provoke them?]]></string>
<string id="513173"><![CDATA[It would. The traitor is afraid. Olgimsky informed me of that. We just need to put a noose around their neck and they'll climb the nearest lamppost by themselves.]]></string>
<string id="513174"><![CDATA[Very well. We'll see which is which.]]></string>
<string id="513175"><![CDATA[How can I help you, good sir?]]></string>
<string id="513176"><![CDATA[Of course. Here you go. Don't come here again. We'll be gone soon.]]></string>
<string id="513177"><![CDATA[I know that one of you always tells the truth, another always lies, and the third does a little bit of both. I hope you're not going to deny that?]]></string>
<string id="513178"><![CDATA[That is true. But how does that help you?]]></string>
<string id="513179"><![CDATA[Which of those are you?]]></string>

<string id="513190"><![CDATA[You know, I think you are the lying bastard!]]></string>
<string id="513191"><![CDATA[Wrong. But since I don't think I can change your mind, I'd be better off killing you. I've risked my life for far too long to throw it away right before leaving this forsaken place!]]></string>

<string id="513200"><![CDATA[Does it really matter?]]></string>
<string id="513201"><![CDATA[Of course it matters! I want to get even with the double-crossing bastard because his misdeeds almost cost me my life! But I can make peace with a fellow agent who gave in to the temptation in hour of hardship. So which are you?]]></string>

<string id="513335"><![CDATA[Who did? ]]></string>
<string id="513336"><![CDATA[Saburov. He has appointed one of the well-respected townspeople as the master of cremations. That is a death sentence, of course; I doubt anyone could survive that assignment… Well, obviously you can also try to get an outfit from an Executor—they do still have them. I saw them dig a pit in a lot by the Cemetery today. Many of them stayed there too.]]></string>
<string id="513337"><![CDATA[What kind of lot? ]]></string>
<string id="513338"><![CDATA[Just a lot by the Cemetery. Go ask them. I'm sure they'll find a spare mask and cloak for you. And if they don't, address your complaints to Saburov.]]></string>
<string id="513339"><![CDATA[Fine.]]></string>
<string id="513340"><![CDATA[Did you give the order to stop burying and to start cremating? ]]></string>
<string id="513341"><![CDATA[Yes. As a one last thing. Right before handing it all to Aglaya Lilich.]]></string>
<string id="513342"><![CDATA[And who did you appoint to manage the burials?]]></string>
<string id="513343"><![CDATA[...One Peter Stamatin. You don't know him.]]></string>
<string id="513344"><![CDATA[You've sentenced him to death.]]></string>
<string id="513345"><![CDATA[He deserved it.]]></string>
<string id="513346"><![CDATA[I don't doubt that. But still, how exactly? I guess it would make sense to ask the man himself.]]></string>
<string id="513347"><![CDATA[Revoke your decision! Choose someone else!]]></string>
<string id="513348"><![CDATA[There is no person in this town who deserves death more than Peter Stamatin. Even if street murderers were responsible and ambitious enough for the job, I'd still choose him over them. I don't have to explain my choices to you.]]></string>
<string id="513349"><![CDATA[I said, revoke it.]]></string>
<string id="513350"><![CDATA[No. The decision is final and is not up for a debate.]]></string>

<string id="513355"><![CDATA[I've been told that you've been given some stage props... Executor outfits?]]></string>
<string id="513356"><![CDATA[It is. Saburov didn't have an opportunity to finish me off fair and square. I am not subject to court... due to me being of unsound mind. And now he has a chance to get rid of me gracefully and reliably. By the way, I've given the cloaks away to Executors. I've only left one mask for myself. It's an omen.]]></string>
<string id="513357"><![CDATA[But why? ]]></string>
<string id="513358"><![CDATA[He thinks I'm a vicious murderer. There was an abominable crime... Old business! I'll tell this to you and to you only—it wasn't my fault… but I ended up taking the blame. I didn't kill him! I wanted to, yes. I could have…]]></string>
<string id="513359"><![CDATA[What the hell? How many people have killed someone around here lately? They are all murderers! I wish at least one tenth of them were punished! ]]></string>
<string id="513360"><![CDATA[Yes, yes... Right you are... Actually, I wish they'd give me a three-day delay—nothing more! Do you think… Do you think it would possible to arrange for them to leave me alone until… say, Friday?]]></string>
<string id="513361"><![CDATA[Only three days? Why?]]></string>
<string id="513362"><![CDATA[I need to finish my greatest creation. It won't take long, it's just blueprints… and calculations—see? Then I could go ahead and die without a moment's delay.

<string id="513365"><![CDATA[I won't be in charge of burying the dead—I'll have to make sure that no living people have gone six feet under alongside them. I do not know if the disease can inhabit corpses, but the death rate among masters of burials is almost absolute. Everyone gets infected and dies sooner or later. ]]></string>
<string id="513366"><![CDATA[Yes, I have. You know already? ]]></string>
<string id="513367"><![CDATA[Is it true that you were appointed master of cremations? ]]></string>
<string id="513368"><![CDATA[Rest assured, Peter, I'll see to it all. I'll talk to the Inquisitor. You'll be left in peace.]]></string>
<string id="513369"><![CDATA[Thank you, old boy. I'm not asking for myself, but for the art…]]></string>
<string id="513370"><![CDATA[Hush. I don't need your excuses.]]></string>
<string id="513371"><![CDATA[I'm not sure if it's doable…]]></string>
<string id="513372"><![CDATA[Then I cannot give you the sacred symbol of my new position. I'd only trade it for three days of freedom. ]]></string>
<string id="513373"><![CDATA[I'll think about it.]]></string>
<string id="513374"><![CDATA[Peter, I'll talk to the Inquisitor. Stay in.]]></string>
<string id="513375"><![CDATA[I couldn't go out even if I wanted to. I'm barely standing. Well, at least I'll have one last gulp of sap…]]></string>
<string id="513376"><![CDATA[Just don't overdo it.]]></string>
<string id="513377"><![CDATA[I want to ask a favour of you. Saburov, abusing the power he's been given, is endangering the life of a certain Peter Stamatin.]]></string>
<string id="513378"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="513379"><![CDATA[It seems he's trying to settle a personal grudge.]]></string>
<string id="513380"><![CDATA[And who is that Peter Stamatin?]]></string>
<string id="513381"><![CDATA[Well… a person.]]></string>
<string id="513382"><![CDATA[He's my friend.]]></string>
<string id="513383"><![CDATA[The creator of the specular tower on the other side of the river.]]></string>
<string id="513384"><![CDATA[Oh? Then his life more than deserves to be saved.]]></string>
<string id="513385"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="513386"><![CDATA[And how exactly is Saburov needlessly endangering his life?]]></string>
<string id="513387"><![CDATA[He put Stamatin in charge of burials and cremations. The work is highly dangerous since he has to deal with the dying all the time.]]></string>
<string id="513388"><![CDATA[We can fix that. We'll find a replacement.]]></string>
<string id="513389"><![CDATA[You have my gratitude.]]></string>
<string id="513390"><![CDATA[Peter... Peter? Can you hear me? You are not the master of cremations and burials anymore. ]]></string>
<string id="513391"><![CDATA[Oh... How appropriate, old boy... So, I can get back to work now. Take the mask, I will have no need of it for now. Although I could use it to mix ink... ]]></string>

<string id="513414"><![CDATA[The Polyhedron. It's the most recent construction project this town has had.]]></string>
<string id="513415"><![CDATA[I'd start with the wells—or rather with a very particular well that's been bothering me for a while now.]]></string>
<string id="513416"><![CDATA[According to your notes, the disease might have sprung from below the ground. Am I correct?]]></string>
<string id="513417"><![CDATA[The Abattoir. I still haven't got a chance to get in there—and I suspect this is where it all began.]]></string>
<string id="513421"><![CDATA[Indeed—just like the previous plague epidemic. That epidemiological hazard appeared in the south during coal mining; and the climate was comparable to the local one too, by the way.]]></string>

<string id="513425"><![CDATA[I went to the Abattoir and came back with something of value. Listen to me, oynon… If my hope proves to be true, we'll have a serum by tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="513426"><![CDATA[That's some news! So what was that… thing you came back with?]]></string>
<string id="513427"><![CDATA[Blood. Blood again. I'm not ready to say where I got it. But it may very well be what Stakh worked on… only better. It's still alive. Look if it has… you know?]]></string>
<string id="513428"><![CDATA[So you just want me to examine this blood under a microscope? Just that?]]></string>
<string id="513429"><![CDATA[If you study this blood, oynon, tomorrow I'll hand you a dose of functional panacea. And if you prove this is the the blood we need… might be I hand the panacea to you today. I trust your word. Is this convincing enough for you?]]></string>
<string id="513430"><![CDATA[It is. Where do I find you?]]></string>
<string id="513431"><![CDATA[I'll be around here. Still have a hell of a lot to do. If there's trouble, I'll let you know. Then we should meet in that basement under the Corpulent Workshop. ]]></string>
<string id="513432"><![CDATA[All right.]]></string>
<string id="513433"><![CDATA[Tell me, how do I get inside the Abattoir?]]></string>
<string id="513434"><![CDATA[The gates are blocked with boulders from the inside. When the time comes, butchers roll them aside. You can find a way in after that. Wait for the right moment.]]></string>
<string id="513435"><![CDATA[And when are the boulders rolled aside? At what time?]]></string>
<string id="513436"><![CDATA[There is some kind of regularity, but I haven't cracked it yet. Tried to squeeze it out of the Mother Superior, but she's only fooling around. I can never understand if she's serious or not.]]></string>
<string id="513437"><![CDATA[Are they going to be opened today?]]></string>
<string id="513438"><![CDATA[There is a massive butcher feud inside, they're fighting each other. Something displeased them quite a bit… I might have played a part in it, I'm afraid. The Mother Superior claims that everything should quiet down after midnight. Maybe about two o'clock they'll roll away the boulder blocking the main entrance. They'll let you in after that if the Mother allows it.]]></string>
<string id="513439"><![CDATA[Do butchers even get sick? I haven't seen a single butcher die of the Sand Plague.]]></string>
<string id="513440"><![CDATA[That is… a curious fact. I mean, I have seen sick butchers, but very few of them. Almost all the dead Steppe men found in the Termitary were murdered. But there were also sick ones, though, I know that for certain.]]></string>
<string id="513441"><![CDATA[You've been to the Termitary during the lockdown, haven't you?]]></string>
<string id="513442"><![CDATA[Yes. I have. But don't ask me who led me in.]]></string>
<string id="513444"><![CDATA[What are you afraid of?]]></string>
<string id="513445"><![CDATA[I'm not afraid of anything. But way too many people died right in front of me these last few days. Not of the plague, but rather by malicious will of those too keen to execute their idea of justice. You know what I mean.]]></string>
<string id="513446"><![CDATA[Yes, I understand.]]></string>
<string id="513447"><![CDATA[I've checked the blood. Whose blood is it, Burakh? It's not human.]]></string>
<string id="513448"><![CDATA[Then you're free to go and test my makeshift panacea on someone. It should work.]]></string>
<string id="513449"><![CDATA[And... how much of this potion can be made?]]></string>
<string id="513450"><![CDATA[Not much for now. Ten, fifteen doses. Save it, oynon.]]></string>
<string id="513451"><![CDATA[So now we have a serum?]]></string>
<string id="513452"><![CDATA[Of a kind. Here, take it. It's sort of a natural extract.]]></string>
<string id="513453"><![CDATA[That's some wish-wash…]]></string>
<string id="513454"><![CDATA[Give it back then.]]></string>

<string id="513491"><![CDATA[Why are they fighting?]]></string>
<string id="513492"><![CDATA[Yesterday, after they were released, they had a council of sorts. Today they split in half. Some demand the Foreman's death, others, it seems, want to have their way with Olgimsky. In all honesty, I'm confused and don't have a slightest idea what's happening. The Mother says there's a fierce battle in there.]]></string>
<string id="513493"><![CDATA[But you have been to the Termitary before?]]></string>
<string id="513494"><![CDATA[And what if she doesn't?]]></string>
<string id="513495"><![CDATA[Then better not to try it at all. They will attack you as soon as you get inside, and not only that, they'll send out a party to chase you. Don't play games with them, oynon. The local ways out to be respected.]]></string>

<string id="513512"><![CDATA[I don't "guard", I safeguard… yes. Because I'm the Mother Superior.]]></string>

<string id="513516"><![CDATA[No one called me that! It's not a name! Everyone in our family was a Superior. Daddy was the Father Superior.]]></string>
<string id="513517"><![CDATA[Why Mother?]]></string>

<string id="513532"><![CDATA[Of course I was here. If not for me, everyone who's upstairs would also be sick and dead. I was here, so there wasn't a Mother Superior in the other building. That's why everyone's dead there.]]></string>

<string id="513544"><![CDATA[Why are they angry?]]></string>
<string id="513545"><![CDATA[Because we didn't feed them. But they locked themselves away on purpose! We didn't make them to! It's their own fault, not mine!]]></string>

<string id="513574"><![CDATA[Oh, so I'm "not far off the mark", huh?]]></string>
<string id="513575"><![CDATA[I did indeed hide a certain crime I've committed. And I believe that something nasty was indeed dug up, and bred deadly bacteria. The only snag here is that those two insightful observations are not… connected in any fashion.]]></string>

<string id="513577"><![CDATA[I don't know anything for sure. Moreover, I've found nothing to support that theory. The earth in the well is clean. And the deeper I dig, the cleaner and denser it becomes. Pure sand and solid white clay.]]></string>
<string id="513578"><![CDATA[But why didn't you tell me of your suspicions?]]></string>

<string id="513580"><![CDATA[Why in the world?]]></string>
<string id="513581"><![CDATA[Don’t lie to me, Vlad. I may not be a specialist in clay either, but I'm good enough at microbiology. The thing that's eating up your blood was born underground, in mineral deposits.]]></string>
<string id="513582"><![CDATA[Over the years, the people have bored countless holes into the ground. All for naught: they always hit a layer of compacted clay. The town is full of those dead-end burrows, those underground creepholes. Who would ever believe that they all came to solid rock, like a prisoner's tunnel comes to a brick wall? ]]></string>
<string id="513583"><![CDATA[That's not a good enough reason to give that order.]]></string>
<string id="513584"><![CDATA[I can't peek inside your head, now can I? Perhaps you wouldn't issue that order. But the general, who's arriving here with his forces tomorrow, wouldn’t listen to you mumbling that it's nothing more than a theory. He'd just do it.]]></string>
<string id="513585"><![CDATA[Perhaps you're not far from the truth. Can you swear to me that there was nothing in the well? On your family's honour?]]></string>
<string id="513586"><![CDATA[Yes. You can have a sample and analyze it if you will. A sample of sand and clay… If it's necessary, I can even call my people and have them dig it up again. But honestly… you're going to need a deeper hole than that.]]></string>
<string id="513587"><![CDATA[No need for that. How can I get into the Abattoir?]]></string>
<string id="513588"><![CDATA[So this is the person who's responsible for turning the Termitary into a mass grave…]]></string>
<string id="513589"><![CDATA[Who told you that?]]></string>
<string id="513590"><![CDATA[Aspity.]]></string>
<string id="513591"><![CDATA[That's not important. What's important is whether I'm going to relay that to the Inquisitor.]]></string>
<string id="513592"><![CDATA[No use denying it now… I knew that the truth would come out when the Termitary is unlocked… I just hoped I would have time before that. No such luck, I suppose.]]></string>
<string id="513593"><![CDATA[Have time for what?]]></string>
<string id="513594"><![CDATA[That bitch… It amazes me how she won't even demand anything! Everything she does, she does purely out of malice and spite!]]></string>
<string id="513595"><![CDATA[Tell me everything, Vlad. Your life is hanging by a thread.]]></string>
<string id="513596"><![CDATA[Worse. It's not my life, it's my family's honour.]]></string>
<string id="513597"><![CDATA[Start talking.]]></string>
<string id="513598"><![CDATA[So you did your best to conceal this, huh… Perhaps you know more about the plague than you show either? What with this well of yours?]]></string>
<string id="513599"><![CDATA[I did indeed hide a certain crime I've committed. And I believe that something nasty was indeed dug up, and bred deadly bacteria. The only snag here is that those two insightful observations are not in any way connected.]]></string>

<string id="513601"><![CDATA[Tough luck, doctor. I don't trust you. My confession wouldn't be of any use to you, but it could raise too much noise. You'll draw all the wrong conclusions… The consequences could be tragic, especially if the Inquistor and the Commander get involved.]]></string>

<string id="513616"><![CDATA[She doesn't. Burakh has unknowingly crossed her. In fact, if matters continue to develop as they are now, Burakh's actions are going to spell Aglaya's death sentence. Unless you interfere, of course.]]></string>

<string id="513626"><![CDATA[What games?]]></string>
<string id="513627"><![CDATA[My sister's affection for me has been dwindling, and she's come up with all sorts of schemes concerning Tycheek's little daughter… It seems the screw makes another turn. Oh, poor father! Was his sacrifice in vain?]]></string>

<string id="513634"><![CDATA[Are you joking?]]></string>
<string id="513635"><![CDATA[She really wants to see the person who ordered the Termitary closed. As far as I understand, I'm not the only person she's asked for assistance with this matter. Burakh will probably ignore her request, but as for Clara…]]></string>
<string id="513636"><![CDATA[I don't know. I didn't go into that much detail.]]></string>
<string id="513637"><![CDATA[Yes. I must go there immediately. If I don't, they'll kill my father. Please, warn him, tell him not to go to the Termitary under any circumstances! I shall go immediately. I must come to them before my father beats me to it.]]></string>
<string id="513638"><![CDATA[That is very honourable of you. I'll warn your father and follow you as soon as I can. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to speak in your defense.]]></string>
<string id="513641"><![CDATA[Aspity, say, do you by any chance know what Vlad the Younger was digging out?]]></string>
<string id="513642"><![CDATA[Ah, the leech won't crack! Thinks he's the smartest! And also he seems to think that he can get out of this deal and that well with his hands and name clean... But that's fine, I know how to make him talk all right.]]></string>
<string id="513643"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="513644"><![CDATA[It's simple. Just reveal to the world all those thousands of lifes that have perished in a few days because of him. And to think that I, a simple girl that I am, blamed the father… Shame. What a shame.]]></string>
<string id="513645"><![CDATA[What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="513646"><![CDATA[It was he who ordered to close down the Termitary. He hid the truth from his father, blamed it all on some imaginary strike—he knew how to get to the old man, to make him mad, to make him damn everyone inside.]]></string>
<string id="513647"><![CDATA[Wait... So he knew about the epidemic beforehand?]]></string>
<string id="513648"><![CDATA[Spot on.]]></string>
<string id="513649"><![CDATA[But Big Vlad knew about the disease...]]></string>
<string id="513650"><![CDATA[He found out eventually, of course. Took the fall for the heir! He's done, he's old, he doesn't care about additional stains on his tired concience—whereas his son has a town yet to rule. And to be popular with. That's essential to ruling.]]></string>
<string id="513651"><![CDATA[Didn't see that coming.]]></string>
<string id="513652"><![CDATA[Has Vlad the Younger even had that kind of power?]]></string>
<string id="513653"><![CDATA[Yeah. On the other hand, he is a loyal son still, he wouldn't like to see his father's head roll... And oh, can the Mother make heads roll! Both of them will stick to that secret tooth and nail. I'd have a go on it myself, but that Changeling girl has a better idea.]]></string>
<string id="513654"><![CDATA[Thank you, Aspity. That explains a lot.]]></string>
<string id="513655"><![CDATA[Who told you that?]]></string>
<string id="513656"><![CDATA[Well, there were survivors in the Termitary, and they did get out. And the stories they tell—they make my blood run even colder than it naturally is…]]></string>

<string id="513666"><![CDATA[My boy was absolutely in the right! Naturally, he was at a loss. His decision was too radical. He couldn't inform everyone because… it was just that kind of day. You lot came to crowd us when it was already too late. We knew by then that unlocking the Termitary would mean destroying the Town.]]></string>
<string id="513667"><![CDATA[And yet you've decided to take the fall for him.]]></string>
<string id="513668"><![CDATA[As if the fall was obligatory… His hand was forced. And then his mouth was shut… He had no choice. He cared for me… in his own way. He did exactly like I taught him. And so I did my best to care for him… when it was my turn.]]></string>

<string id="513678"><![CDATA[The foul demon… I had a feeling she will be the end of my kin… and so she has. A shaggy death came from the Steppe, just as was foretold by my dear wife… I suspect the evil wench wasn't merely… observing.]]></string>
<string id="513679"><![CDATA[So it was Vlad the Younger who ordered to lock the Termitary, wasn't it?]]></string>
<string id="513680"><![CDATA[Yes, she sends shivers down my spine as well. But it's not her that is a menace to your son. It's not her you have protected him from…]]></string>

<string id="513697"><![CDATA[I've investigated the water hypothesis already, yes. Those frightened luddits have even destroyed the town water intake, which lead to a malfunction of the town water supply system. We've found ourselves in a world of trouble because of that.]]></string>
<string id="513698"><![CDATA[How about we check this hypothesis thoroughly though? Before we get on with inspecting buildings, we need to make sure the disease was not water-borne. Wells, springs, the river… or maybe a young new stream. Anything.]]></string>
<string id="513699"><![CDATA[All right. There is one suspicious well I'd like to check.]]></string>
<string id="513700"><![CDATA[Still, I believe the disease came from the outside—but not via water, but rather carried by a person. Or an animal, perhaps.]]></string>

<string id="513736"><![CDATA[We have caught the bacteria. Now we know what the blood of an infected man looks like. We have learned what the Sand Plague does to its victims as it thrives within their bodies. The rulers have chosen to take advantage of these findings in order to reignite the witch-hunt. Only this time it is with the carrier instead of the maneater. I need to talk with Saburov about it.]]></string>
<string id="513737"><![CDATA[There is a terrifying rumour spreading of the carrier in the Cathedral. It has put everyone into a state of trepidation. Saburov places the blame on Yulia and Lara. The experiment that Rubin and I conducted was a success. The truth should be easy to establish; we only need to test the blood.]]></string>
<string id="513738"><![CDATA[Olgimsky is certain that both Anna and Aspity are guilty. Could it be avarice that drives his conclusion rather than common sense? Perhaps he is right, to an extent.

<string id="513804"><![CDATA[He went to the Termitary on my assignment... and still has not returned. Problem is, I had special hopes for this assignment. He was supposed to not only report to me about the inner workings of this... Abattoir, if you will, but also bring one other thing. ]]></string>
<string id="513805"><![CDATA[What thing?]]></string>
<string id="513806"><![CDATA[Panacea. Today Burakh was going to perfect a remedy that would heal anyone sick with the Sand Pest, however grave their condition.]]></string>
<string id="513807"><![CDATA[That sounds like some sort of folk medicine… dubious medicine.]]></string>
<string id="513808"><![CDATA[Effective, still. Wasn't the vaccine you prepared with the local doctor also based on folk recipes? The approach is completely similar.]]></string>
<string id="513809"><![CDATA[Fair enough.]]></string>
<string id="513810"><![CDATA[It's not just about the panacea. Burakh is much more significant than many would care to admit… including himself, perhaps. Could you please inquire about him? I don't doubt his word, but he could have run into some unforseen danger because of his invention... Do you understand?]]></string>
<string id="513811"><![CDATA[I don't know if I can make it inside the Abattoir. Unless, perhaps, you provide me with military support.]]></string>
<string id="513812"><![CDATA[Getting soldiers is not so simple. They won't listen to me and Block… who seems to have no intention to listen to me either.  But I am not asking you to descend into that underground pagan shrine. Just inquire about Burakh, if you have an opportunity.]]></string>

<string id="513818"><![CDATA[Power can take very different shapes…]]></string>
<string id="513819"><![CDATA[Are you talking about Block?]]></string>
<string id="513820"><![CDATA[I never imagined that he hated me so much. Why? What did I ever do to him? I was expecting some instinctive resentment as part of the age-long conflict between the military and the inquisition… but Block, it seems, would happily have my head on a platter.]]></string>
<string id="513821"><![CDATA[What might be the reason?]]></string>
<string id="513822"><![CDATA[I wonder that myself. For a moment, I thought he was driven by the same feeling that I am: a great man, when unexpectedly betrayed by the people he loves, will often seek to fill the whole universe with his blind spite. Yes, the feeling is indeed familiar...]]></string>
<string id="513823"><![CDATA[Does he consider himself betrayed? ]]></string>
<string id="513824"><![CDATA[Come now, Dankovsky... They threw us all in the fire, hoping that we burn to death while simultaneously putting the flame out with our very bodies. What I'm really wondering is whether the intention to destroy the town is the product of his own judgement—or comes from the Powers That Be.]]></string>

<string id="513826"><![CDATA[I concur.]]></string>
<string id="513827"><![CDATA[Can a commanding officer charged with a mission like this act on his own judgement?]]></string>
<string id="513828"><![CDATA[Block would. He has become full of himself, drunk on his own glory. I have no doubt that he already dreams of himself becoming head of the government or some sort of emergency committee; a consulate at the very least. Besides, who's to say he wasn't instructed to act according to the circumstance?]]></string>
<string id="513829"><![CDATA[Just like you and me—given the pro forma freedom to decide, but left with no choice in reality.]]></string>
<string id="513830"><![CDATA[Don't you think a situation like this would be infuriating to a clever commander like him, who also has the troops' undying loyalty and armaments such as have been shown to us? Free to surround, to die—but never to fire…]]></string>
<string id="513831"><![CDATA[Could that really have been the actual order?]]></string>
<string id="513832"><![CDATA[I think so. A legitimate order to act in good conscience—complete with a sidenote suggesting that he have the last will ready before firing the big guns.]]></string>
<string id="513833"><![CDATA[Then why send the army here at all?]]></string>
<string id="513834"><![CDATA[You know… just in case. In case of riots. In case of our defeat.

<string id="513837"><![CDATA[Yes... Almost.]]></string>
<string id="513838"><![CDATA[...Until you, Aglaya, declare that the town is saved. Understandably, he resents the situation—and extends his resentment to you.]]></string>
<string id="513839"><![CDATA[He saved me yesterday. ]]></string>
<string id="513840"><![CDATA[So I've heard. It would be rather ridiculous to deny his courage. Whatever he is, he is a master of his trade.]]></string>
<string id="513841"><![CDATA[Quite.]]></string>
<string id="513842"><![CDATA[That monstrosity they brought… They can't fire it here. I'm not sure they can fire it at all.]]></string>
<string id="513843"><![CDATA[Why not? They surely can.]]></string>
<string id="513844"><![CDATA[What, are they planning to lower the barrel parallel to the ground and fire horizontally at point-blank range?]]></string>
<string id="513845"><![CDATA[Of course not. That particular weapon was brought here for me personally… as an impressively high-scale persuasion method. The actual guns that are meant to bombard the town were left on the railroad span, some thirty kilometers away.]]></string>
<string id="513846"><![CDATA[So we'll have some time while they're finding the range?]]></string>
<string id="513847"><![CDATA[A morbid joke. Once they take that big gun away, it's over. The bombardment begins a few hours after that.]]></string>
<string id="513848"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="513849"><![CDATA[Since when is our army fielding such monstrosities anyway?]]></string>
<string id="513850"><![CDATA[It's the latest breakthrough in artillery production. The military top brass' juvenile love of giant weapons. To an immature mind, size translates directly to power. Ironically, Block drafted his military reform to stop the construction of such beasts.]]></string>
<string id="513851"><![CDATA[That's just lovely, isn't it.]]></string>
<string id="513852"><![CDATA[But the power of knowledge will always find a way to trump the force of arms.]]></string>

<string id="513854"><![CDATA[How can I help you?]]></string>
<string id="513855"><![CDATA[First of all, you could collect detailed data on that peculiar structure. I mean the Polyhedron.]]></string>

<string id="513865"><![CDATA[My yesterday's visit to the Abattoir was unsuccessful.]]></string>
<string id="513866"><![CDATA[Yes, I'm aware of that. Well, we're all making a gamble here. But Burakh has agreed to help me out. The residents of the Abattoir accept him as one of their own and aren't as hostile to him. I'd even go as fas as to say that he's on good terms with the people who manage the biorhythms of that stone belly.]]></string>
<string id="513867"><![CDATA[Does he go there regularly? ]]></string>
<string id="513868"><![CDATA[Yes, several times a day. We can learn everything we need from him.]]></string>
<string id="513869"><![CDATA[But can his words be trusted?]]></string>
<string id="513870"><![CDATA[Absolutely. Both his words and his deeds.]]></string>
<string id="513871"><![CDATA[Well, I'll trust your insight then.]]></string>
<string id="513872"><![CDATA[I feel that you will come to regret placing your faith in him.]]></string>
<string id="513873"><![CDATA[Oh, I'm almost certain he is to become my downfall. But we only need a few days to ensure our victory, and we're unlikely to have more anyway; for a few days we can act together in the interest of the common good. ]]></string>

With pestilence being an urgent threat, a state of emergency has been declared by Alexander Saburov—the head of the family by which executive power is traditionally represented. As such, Alexander Saburov is granted the full authority of a town governor. The rest of the families in power were obliged to provide him with what assistance they could.

The only thing that may possibly account for the phenomenon of infected objects and environment—evident in different parts of the town, as well as the earth, water, and air—is the outstanding vitality of the local nature. Science proved to be powerless here. The bacteria were not isolated.

<string id="514092"><![CDATA[The men on which the entire existence of the settlement depends had to face a very unpleasant discovery: the town was entirely unprepared for the calamity that has befallen it. Their attempts to fight the disease are greatly complicated by the lack of a hospital or an isolation ward, and even by the shortage of cemetery space. Because of that, the buildings most precious to the townspeople have had to be repurposed: the Cathedral became an isolation ward and the Theatre was made into a hospital. To address the issue of too many dead bodies, a town morgue was established in a huge warehouse previously used to store meat.

The living microbe would allow them to produce a vaccine and therefore to protect many other towns or even countries where the disease may resurface.

Were we to expose the maneater today, the town would have been spared the punitive measures that the Inquisitor is so eager to unleash upon it. Alas, the investigation was a failure.

It is almost as if her suspects were the buildings, the river, the celestial bodies and the bowels of the earth. Could the pestilence have been caused by the world's very nature, and not the human population of this place? This is definitely not what a true Inquisitor would assume! What game is she playing?

Still, there is hardly any discussion as to who is in control of the situation. In three days, the army will use heavy artillery to level the town.

It is capable of creating mirages and visions by means of communicating mirrors whose motion governs the intricate interdependence of optical and kinetic illusions. The whole mechanism is possible because the architects of the building have succeded in resolving the contradiction between the celestial and the earthly. The sphere does not seem to be supported by any kind of foundation, rather it is reminiscent of a flower whose bulk is carried by a disproportionately fragile stem. Perhaps, the stairway upon which the building rests is not a structural support, but instead an anchor to hold this floating structure to the earth in the way of a stepladder thrown from a dirigible?

<string id="514200"><![CDATA[You spoke to the author of this creation yesterday, didn't you? ]]></string>
<string id="514201"><![CDATA[Yes, I did. ]]></string>
<string id="514202"><![CDATA[So find a way to torture him into telling you how they did it. ]]></string>
<string id="514203"><![CDATA[All right, I will. But I don't think Peter was the one to mount the construction; I think Andrey was.]]></string>
<string id="514204"><![CDATA[It could have been the Pope for all I care! It doesn't matter. I need the facts—the facts only. Something we can attach to the rest of the documents and show to the Commander. I don't see the blueprints of the foundation here. Do find them for all that's holy.]]></string>
<string id="514205"><![CDATA[I doubt the Polyhedron is the cause.  ]]></string>
<string id="514206"><![CDATA[I am not positive it has caused the epidemic. It's just my presumption. But you cannot deny that disregarding this presumption would be an act of criminal negligence.]]></string>
<string id="514207"><![CDATA[Fine. I'll try to find the mind behind the blueprints. ]]></string>
<string id="514208"><![CDATA[Fine. ]]></string>
<string id="514209"><![CDATA[Torture is your job, Inquisitor. ]]></string>
<string id="514210"><![CDATA[Not this time, Bachelor. I have my reasons for that, but I will not disclose them.]]></string>
<string id="514211"><![CDATA[Well. I will do as you ask. Even though the construction wasn't mounted by Peter, but rather by his twin brother.]]></string>
<string id="514212"><![CDATA[Are you sure? I have no doubt the Polyhedron has nothing to do with the epidemic. It's a masterpiece.]]></string>
<string id="514213"><![CDATA[So what? It is indeed a masterpiece. It is entirely possible that humankind won't ever create anything to rival it. It's more than a masterpiece—it's a revolution. This construction is no less a breakthrough than starflight. ]]></string>
<string id="514214"><![CDATA[I believe they're incompatible, this edifice and the plague. The Polyhedron has been reliably protecting everyone who tried to hide inside from the epidemic.]]></string>
<string id="514215"><![CDATA[Trust my guts, Bachelor. I want to know the truth. ]]></string>
<string id="514216"><![CDATA[So do I, believe me.]]></string>
<string id="514217"><![CDATA[I just have a gut feeling.]]></string>
<string id="514218"><![CDATA[I feel slightly envious. Like me, its creator has tried to break through to where men are not allowed. But, unlike me, he succeeded.]]></string>
<string id="514219"><![CDATA[I think it's where the pest is spreading from.]]></string>
<string id="514220"><![CDATA[I completely agree. A strange construction, a strange plague... If so many strange things seem to crowd so eagerly, it's only natural to assume they have the same source.]]></string>
<string id="514221"><![CDATA[I agree. ]]></string>
<string id="514222"><![CDATA[There's little to no time left.]]></string>
<string id="514223"><![CDATA[Well... Do have a look... I've got the blueprint of the foundation. Here it is. Take a look.]]></string>
<string id="514224"><![CDATA[So the miraculous machine turned out to be a lever pumping poisonous organic matter from below the ground? How symbolic. There is a certain familiar logic to it… the general logic of the world structure. Don't tell me you're surprised, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="514225"><![CDATA[Why are you calling it a lever? ]]></string>
<string id="514226"><![CDATA[So the local diggers, drillers, and engineers find sophisticated ways to screw a longest stem into the ground under Andrey Stamatin's guidance. The polyhedral egg lies upon this stem as though it was a spring. Reminds you of a lever, doesn't it?]]></string>
<string id="514227"><![CDATA[But if the builders stirred the underground deposits when they installed the foundation, why has the outbreak only happened now?]]></string>
<string id="514228"><![CDATA[Because of the soil. I think this clot used to be a pit where the Steppe people would bury the remains of slaughtered bulls. There are facts to support this. I suspect it was situated above the cramp's point. The pressure was gradually increasing. Perhaps the pintle was shifting. And when it got to the clot... ]]></string>
<string id="514229"><![CDATA[Yes. Sound plausible.]]></string>
<string id="514230"><![CDATA[We have found the source. I congratulate you on the victory, Daniil. Tomorrow is the last—and the hardest day. ]]></string>
<string id="514231"><![CDATA[I congratulate you too. It's our common victory. ]]></string>
<string id="514232"><![CDATA[See you at the meeting at the Headquarters tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="514233"><![CDATA[I'll come. ]]></string>
<string id="514234"><![CDATA[There is a mutiny. Two companies have gone rogue. They're trying to get to the long-range weapons now.]]></string>
<string id="514235"><![CDATA[I know that already. This is really too much…]]></string>
<string id="514236"><![CDATA[Block ia hunting them and punishing them mercilessly.]]></string>
<string id="514237"><![CDATA[Yes, he's good at that… The worst is the fact that dissent is shortening our timeframe—and it's already short. We need to be swift. Any minute now Block will realize that every hour of delay is biting off a quarter of his forces.]]></string>
<string id="514238"><![CDATA[We'll do everything we need to by tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="514239"><![CDATA[We may not make it.]]></string>
<string id="514240"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="514241"><![CDATA[Hey! You haven't abandoned me, old boy! I wasn't expecting you to come, to be honest… See, I was stupid enough to return here… But you probably know already that the soldiers are at each others' throats. The squads that are loyal to the general are killling the mutineers by the cannon—and the latter are quite displeased with me!]]></string>
<string id="514242"><![CDATA[Tell me what happened. Start from the beginning.]]></string>
<string id="514243"><![CDATA[So, yesterday I came to my brother to sit by his side—as I was planning to. And there these war mongrels were… when I saw them, I knew our cake was dough. I had them removed from my brother's place and ran off looking for him. I kept searching all night, but he was nowhere to be seen. I even went to the general... and he told me there's a mutiny!]]></string>
<string id="514249"><![CDATA[You know, it's so peculiar that you're only asking about it now... In fact all these days I've been waiting for you to finally become interested in the foundation of the miracle! Weren't you surprised in the slightest? It would be easier to show you though... I'd have supported my words with documents if Peter hadn't burned the blueprints.]]></string>
<string id="514250"><![CDATA[I saw them. But his designs only show the optical structure of the internal sphere. What I want to know is how the thin base can support it. As far as I understood, the main trick that enables the whole construction is that the main compartment doesn't touch the ground at all.]]></string>
<string id="514251"><![CDATA[Indeed. So you got it! Tell me... do you like it? ]]></string>
<string id="514252"><![CDATA[Yes. It's amazing. I've never seen anything like that. ]]></string>
<string id="514253"><![CDATA[Right! And you never will! Peter has created this edifice by mistake. Yes, it's eighty percent his genius, but the other twenty it owes to a weird, ridiculously lucky combination of coincidences! But I have installed it without relying on sheer luck, oh no! It had to do with bold design, angry passion, and precise calculations.  ]]></string>
<string id="514254"><![CDATA[...How have you installed it? This question has been driving me mad for more than a week now.]]></string>
<string id="514258"><![CDATA[So? ]]></string>
<string id="514259"><![CDATA[I don't get a thing. These are the designs of some spring. Amplitudes, angles, oscillation… fifty pages of calculations… What is this?]]></string>
<string id="514260"><![CDATA[What is there not to get? It's a steel-woven spring buried underground. A gigantic stem. Five and a half meters in diameter. More than three hundred meters long. That's some scale, huh?]]></string>
<string id="514261"><![CDATA[How did you manage to screw this monster into the ground?]]></string>
<string id="514262"><![CDATA[Oooh... We dug a trench. The riverbed was dry at that time. It was an insane idea. But the Kains asked Vlad to summon up the Kin, and he did. This collective construction has been worked on by the whole Termitary. We laid the pintle down gradually—and we dug its very sting underground at an acute angle.]]></string>
<string id="514263"><![CDATA[Tell me, Andrey, did you find anything when digging the trench?]]></string>
<string id="514264"><![CDATA[Like what?]]></string>
<string id="514265"><![CDATA[Like an organic clot? Any unusual minerals or rot?]]></string>
<string id="514266"><![CDATA[No. Even I was surprised. There were only lifeless soil, firm clay, and sandstone. ]]></string>
<string id="514267"><![CDATA[This cannot be... I don't believe this. ]]></string>
<string id="514268"><![CDATA[At an acute angle? How deep did it reach?]]></string>
<string id="514269"><![CDATA[As deep as anyone has ever reached. We abused nature, there's no denying that. But it was worth it, as you can see.]]></string>
<string id="514270"><![CDATA[Now I understand completely.]]></string>
<string id="514278"><![CDATA[This is really something, old boy...]]></string>
<string id="514279"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="514280"><![CDATA[So? ]]></string>
<string id="514281"><![CDATA[Did you put Andrey Stamatin, the architect, in front of a firing squad?]]></string>
<string id="514282"><![CDATA[I've never heard of this person before. And no, I never gave such an order. Tell me more.]]></string>
<string id="514283"><![CDATA[I was informed that your soldiers took away Andrey Stamatin, an architect, to shoot him. But he must not be shot.]]></string>
<string id="514284"><![CDATA[Listen here.  Any orders given here are given by me. And I gave no such order. If a soldier claims I did, then they are a mutinee and subject to a court martial. I will begin the investigation of this incident immediately.]]></string>
<string id="514285"><![CDATA[Where could he have been taken? ]]></string>
<string id="514286"><![CDATA[I have no idea. I will gather the commanders immediately to find out who could have given out this order. We cannot exclude the possibility that it were the mutineers.]]></string>
<string id="514287"><![CDATA[While you interrogate the officers, Andrey will die! ]]></string>
<string id="514288"><![CDATA[What do you want from me? Do you want me to rush headlong searching for your friend in every nook and cranny? I doubt the result would be anything but negligible. Finding out who gave out the order would be immensely more effective. Unless a bunch of scoundrels acted on their own volition, of course...]]></string>
<string id="514289"><![CDATA[All right, I get your point.]]></string>
<string id="514290"><![CDATA[He was taken to the railway. I request reinforcements to set him free.]]></string>
<string id="514291"><![CDATA[I just was by the weapon. It's patrolled by the 8th Company. These are loyal men. Although… there has indeed been suspicious activity. So what you're saying is the soldiers took your friend claiming to have done so on my orders?]]></string>
<string id="514292"><![CDATA[Yes. ]]></string>
<string id="514293"><![CDATA[Where did you get this information?]]></string>
<string id="514294"><![CDATA[The witnesses of the arrest have told me.]]></string>
<string id="514295"><![CDATA[Fine. I'll summon the company commander and have him report the situation. If your friend was caught red-handed or arrested duly and according to the instructions, he will be brought to me. If the bastards are abusing their authority, we will arrest them.]]></string>
<string id="514296"><![CDATA[It might be too late. ]]></string>
<string id="514297"><![CDATA[I'm sorry to hear that, but I have no right to remove the soldiers from their posts. There is tension. Be patient—or just go there yourself. If you see an execution being prepared for, tell captain Longin that he is to cease unauthorized activity and wait for me.]]></string>
<string id="514298"><![CDATA[Fine.]]></string>
<string id="514299"><![CDATA[What suspicious activity? ]]></string>
<string id="514300"><![CDATA[Answer the question, Bachelor. ]]></string>
<string id="514301"><![CDATA[Yes. ]]></string>
<string id="514302"><![CDATA[Not before you answer mine.]]></string>
<string id="514303"><![CDATA[Stop with the nonsense. You are not my subordinate, but this is not the moment to waste time on such rubbish. Please be so kind as to follow the chain of command. ]]></string>
<string id="514304"><![CDATA[Yes, it was like you said.]]></string>
<string id="514305"><![CDATA[Go to hell. ]]></string>
<string id="514306"><![CDATA[Listen! Your soldiers opened fire at me!]]></string>
<string id="514307"><![CDATA[I am already aware of that. You were absolutely in the right. I thank you.]]></string>
<string id="514308"><![CDATA[Excuse me? ]]></string>
<string id="514309"><![CDATA[Enough, this cannot go on any longer! My units are not following orders. Yesterday a quarter of them succumbed to the disease, today I lost a half more! The only good thing is that the plague mows the mutineers down faster than it does the loyal soldiers. Fitting spoils of their rebellion.]]></string>
<string id="514310"><![CDATA[What units are these? ]]></string>
<string id="514311"><![CDATA[The 15th Company. The flamethrower corps. The 42th infantry batallion—partially… The new raw troops. Transferred under me on a railway haul. Specifically for this damned mission!]]></string>
<string id="514312"><![CDATA[Do they have insignia or other distinctive features?]]></string>
<string id="514313"><![CDATA[Who needs insignia?! If the soldier's off his post, he's a criminal. Criminals are subject to a quick trial and immediate punishment. This is absolutely obvious. Now is not the time to take a soft line.]]></string>
<string id="514314"><![CDATA[What should I do if I see a soldier off the post?]]></string>
<string id="514315"><![CDATA[Kill them on the spot. Offer resistance. Report to me. Although I'm already on it… if only I had enough forces left, the mutineers and traitors would have already been exterminated publicly—just like at the Karstov Fords!]]></string>
<string id="514316"><![CDATA[Fine. I'll keep it in mind.]]></string>
<string id="514317"><![CDATA[Have these children come to you with a request? ]]></string>
<string id="514318"><![CDATA[Yes. The mutinous bastards in military uniforms have taken their relatives somewhere to execute. They've come to beg me to cancel the execution order.]]></string>
<string id="514319"><![CDATA[I hope you did? ]]></string>
<string id="514320"><![CDATA[I never gave the order! All orders which are given to the soldiers without my approval are mutinous! Damn it… What an example they are setting for the rest… The last thing we want is for the weapon crew to become disobedient… These units are also raw. As for the mutineers, we'll punish them harshly.]]></string>
<string id="514321"><![CDATA[How exactly? ]]></string>
<string id="514322"><![CDATA[Any soldier encountered anywhere but where I placed him is a mutineer. They are subject to a court martial. Resist their actions—your reputation will only go up.]]></string>
<string id="514323"><![CDATA[Would you allow me to deal with this unfirtunate case? ]]></string>
<string id="514324"><![CDATA[We wait for tomorrow. ]]></string>
<string id="514325"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="514326"><![CDATA[I've got good news and bad news for you, oynon.]]></string>
<string id="514327"><![CDATA[I'm listening. ]]></string>
<string id="514328"><![CDATA[You asked me to find out the exact location of the underground clot from which the Sand Pest bacteria could have gotten onto the surface…]]></string>
<string id="514329"><![CDATA[I did! Have you succeeded?]]></string>
<string id="514330"><![CDATA[Uh-huh. The thing is, it's everywhere. The deposits are sprawling beneath the whole town like kraken tentacles; they originate in the old cattle husbandry places on the other side of the Gorkhon. The ground is soaked in it.]]></string>
<string id="514331"><![CDATA[...What's the good news then? ]]></string>
<string id="514332"><![CDATA[The good news is that the deposits lie very deep. They're covered by so many layers of solid soil that no borewell could ever reach them. An extremely deep hole would have to be drilled to puncture those clots and spill their contents into the ground waters.]]></string>
<string id="514333"><![CDATA[An extremely deep hole? ]]></string>
<string id="514334"><![CDATA[Yes. I doubt that drilling a hole like that is humanly possible.]]></string>
<string id="514335"><![CDATA[Say, Burakh—if there were a madman that would punch through all those layers, what would happen then?]]></string>
<string id="514336"><![CDATA[Then the poison would gradually spread over the left bank of the Gorkhon. It would soak the ground around us in itself like milk soaks bread.]]></string>
<string id="514337"><![CDATA[And why do you think that hasn't happened already?]]></string>
<string id="514338"><![CDATA[I have other things on my mind now, oynon. Playing safe is pointless. I'm only thinking about mitigating the consequences of the disaster. I want the Sand Pest to be no more a threat to the local population than chicken pox is.]]></string>
<string id="514339"><![CDATA[Yes, I see. Nevertheless, if it has already happened, the town will have to be destroyed. We cannot allow anyone to keep living here.]]></string>
<string id="514340"><![CDATA[Wait, oynon! Do not give out hasty orders. I swear to you, by tomorrow morning I'll find a way to produce so much medicine for the disease that there won't be a need to destroy it.]]></string>
<string id="514341"><![CDATA[By tomorrow morning? ]]></string>
<string id="514342"><![CDATA[Yes. But only if the people that need to be saved are alive. I've told you about them, remember? The kids that'll build a new town here in ten years—a town even more beautiful than the current one.]]></string>
<string id="514343"><![CDATA[I'll think about.]]></string>
<string id="514344"><![CDATA[Damn it... How did you find this out, Burakh? ]]></string>
<string id="514345"><![CDATA[Well, that is unchecked, of course. But the Foreman of the butchers immediately knew what I was talking about. He said the deposits do exist. He drew the map of them sprawling underground.]]></string>
<string id="514346"><![CDATA[Where did they come from?]]></string>
<string id="514347"><![CDATA[It's a secret, oynon. I cannot reveal it to you. ]]></string>
<string id="514348"><![CDATA[Doesn't matter—it's obvious anyway. Ancient cattle burial grounds. You said you had more news?]]></string>
<string id="514349"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="514350"><![CDATA[And now I want you to forget everything that you have ever been told about me. Trust me. Look me in the eye! Or look down—or else you may think that I'm trying to mesmerize you and impose my line of thinking upon you! Aglaya is a traitor. She is the main foe on your victory road.]]></string>
<string id="514351"><![CDATA[You liar. Aglaya is my best friend and the most reliable ally I have. It was she who opened my eyes to the cunning deceit of the Powers That Be. I have wintessed her rightness firsthand.]]></string>
<string id="514352"><![CDATA[She's telling lies. I've just found out that she doesn't want to find the source and defeat the disease at all. She's not counting on victory. She's not trying to find a way to perserve the town in its true form! Her inquisitorial mission is just a smokescreen, a performance!]]></string>
<string id="514353"><![CDATA[What does she want then?]]></string>
<string id="514354"><![CDATA[Only one thing: to destroy the children's Tower. Before she dies. As her final word. And she has chosen you to become her tool. Do you know that these tools are called rams?]]></string>
<string id="514355"><![CDATA["Before she dies"?]]></string>
<string id="514356"><![CDATA[She is doomed. Sentenced to death. Her commission here was her last chance—she had to find a way to save the infected. But her job was done by the Ripper, Artemy Burakh. Yesterday she received a letter. The Powers That Be do not acknowledge that she's fulfilled her mission. She will be executed as soon as she gets back.]]></string>
<string id="514357"><![CDATA[Why would she target the Polyhedron then? She's doomed anyway…]]></string>
<string id="514358"><![CDATA[Because of hatred. Aglaya sees the Polyhedron as Nina Kaina's infernal gift. She thinks that Nina rose high, but her pride drew down the wrath of heavens. Aglaya believes that her duty is to destroy this challenge before it has lead to more evil. Or maybe she doesn't even believe that...]]></string>
<string id="514359"><![CDATA[But what does Nina have to do with her?]]></string>
<string id="514360"><![CDATA[Nina Kaina is her sister. Didn't you know? She used to be Nina Lilich before marrying Victor.]]></string>
<string id="514361"><![CDATA[So is this a display of family sentiments? ]]></string>
<string id="514362"><![CDATA[She desperately, hopelessly abhors her sister. Even stronger than her worst enemy. When I got to uncover this secret and looked into her soul, my hair stood on end! Aglaya believes her sister to be the devil himself, a deathbringer. And you've been a mere tool for her.]]></string>
<string id="514363"><![CDATA[...How so? ]]></string>
<string id="514364"><![CDATA[It's all very simple. The army came. The Inquisitor—halfway to the scaffold already—has no power over the cannons. So she made you convince the Commander—for General Ashes does not believe her one bit. But you will offer him a false report with a clear heart and point in the wrong direction.]]></string>
<string id="514365"><![CDATA[...I need proof. ]]></string>
<string id="514366"><![CDATA[If the people I've asked you about are alive by tomorrow, tomorrow you'll have proof.]]></string>
<string id="514367"><![CDATA[Amen to that.]]></string>
<string id="514368"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="514369"><![CDATA[And my Andrey... Rumour has it he's in danger? ]]></string>
<string id="514370"><![CDATA[Is he the only one who has the blueprints of the Tower's foundation?]]></string>
<string id="514371"><![CDATA[He is. Or perhaps he no longer has them either.]]></string>
<string id="514372"><![CDATA[Could somebody else have them too? Isn't there a copy in your family archive? Do you know that your uncle has granted me access to it?]]></string>
<string id="514373"><![CDATA[I need my Andrey! Even if there were a copy in our archive, you wouldn't get the blueprints now! But if you help Andrey out, you'll see a different meaning to the lines and figures on those blueprints. And I will reward you—if that means anything at all to you, of course.]]></string>
<string id="514374"><![CDATA[All right. I'll help Andrey out.]]></string>
<string id="514375"><![CDATA[Aglaya will sort it all out. And you're right, it doesn't mean anything anymore.]]></string>
<string id="514376"><![CDATA[If he is, I'll drag him out of it. ]]></string>
<string id="514377"><![CDATA[Everything will be decided tomorrow. The black muzzles of the cannons ready to begin the bombardment… so this is what the dark void of death looks like. So the true Nothingness, unlike true magic, can indeed be firmly grasped—with a steel ring, and one of a not particularly large calibre at that!]]></string>
<string id="514378"><![CDATA[Andrey is safe—as safe as humanly possible, anyway. ]]></string>
<string id="514379"><![CDATA[My gratitude will not be long in showing. Tomorrow I'll show you how thankful I can be.]]></string>
<string id="514380"><![CDATA[Tomorrow? ]]></string>
<string id="514381"><![CDATA[Tomorrow the universe will be transformed once again! We shall destroy the pest's hotbed—thanks to you. If you make a miracle happen, and we manage to keep the Polyhedron out of harm's way—oh, what miracles we'll be able to perform… What powers will be at our disposal!]]></string>
<string id="514382"><![CDATA[What are you talking about? ]]></string>
<string id="514383"><![CDATA[Without even knowing it, you will help several people—including Simon—achieve immortality with your victory. Yes, the very Simon whose passing has spelt the beginning of the end for us. But we will bring him back from oblivion! The town will live if Simon lives.]]></string>
<string id="514384"><![CDATA[Please tell me how you're going to save his life.]]></string>
<string id="514385"><![CDATA[You will see everything tomorrow. But I'm begging you—don't let them strike at the Polyhedron.]]></string>
<string id="514386"><![CDATA[Impossible. I really regret to tell you this, but the Polyhedron is the true cause of the outbreak. ]]></string>
<string id="514387"><![CDATA[This cannot be! ]]></string>
<string id="514388"><![CDATA[Yes it can. It is proven. Andrey has provided the missing link. ]]></string>
<string id="514389"><![CDATA[How is it possible? ]]></string>
<string id="514390"><![CDATA[The Polyhedron's base disturbs the poison under the town and drives it upwards. ]]></string>
<string id="514391"><![CDATA[And the destruction of the Polyhedron will stop the epidemic? ]]></string>
<string id="514392"><![CDATA[Possibly. ]]></string>
<string id="514393"><![CDATA[Daniil Dankovsky, please, don't make a last-minute mistake! It seems to me that Aglaya Lilich only wants one thing, and that's to destroy the Tower. I think she's only come here to do that—not to stop the epidemic.]]></string>
<string id="514394"><![CDATA[But what for? ]]></string>
<string id="514395"><![CDATA[I do not know. But she hates it direly. While hiding that hatred for some reason.]]></string>

<string id="514421"><![CDATA[They took Andrey away! The bold chairman of our feast! We could do nothing. They threatened us with guns and even killed two of us.]]></string>
<string id="514422"><![CDATA[Who took him? ]]></string>
<string id="514423"><![CDATA[The soldiers! We were resisting them for almost an hour, but they have broken in and turned everything here upside down.]]></string>
<string id="514424"><![CDATA[Why did it happen? ]]></string>
<string id="514425"><![CDATA[Yesterday Andrey attacked a patrol while trying to protect his brother. He disarmed the soldiers and killed an officer. Today they came to take revenge on him. ]]></string>
<string id="514426"><![CDATA[Where did they take him? ]]></string>
<string id="514427"><![CDATA[I've heard one of them say that they'd take him to the railway dead end. I think they'll lock our Stamatin in one of the carriages… and then shoot him! He's at the railway dead end—look for him there.]]></string>
<string id="514428"><![CDATA[That's a precise description if I've ever heard one… what is this railway dead end?]]></string>
<string id="514429"><![CDATA[Well, I don't know for sure which of the lines is a dead end there! Do I look like a towerwoman? I think that's what they call the line that the military train came by… What, am I wrong?]]></string>
<string id="514430"><![CDATA[When was he taken away? ]]></string>
<string id="514431"><![CDATA[Oh! A moment ago. Or rather half an hour, no more…]]></string>
<string id="514432"><![CDATA[I'll try to do something. ]]></string>
<string id="514433"><![CDATA[There are too many soldiers there! There were more than a dozen of them here—and there must be even more there. You won't make it…]]></string>
<string id="514434"><![CDATA[I'm not going to fight them. I'll report this to the Commander immediately; I'm sure he'll cancel this insane order.]]></string>
<string id="514435"><![CDATA[Don't worry, I will.]]></string>
<string id="514436"><![CDATA[Damn it... I'm too late then! ]]></string>
<string id="514437"><![CDATA[Perhaps you can still make it! Catch them, tell them to stop—you're a celebrity, they'll listen to you!]]></string>
<string id="514438"><![CDATA[Where did they take him? ]]></string>
<string id="514439"><![CDATA[A celebrity, but not for them. No one is going to listen to me... ]]></string>
<string id="514440"><![CDATA[And you also resisted? Fought back even? With what, I wonder?]]></string>
<string id="514441"><![CDATA[Why are you making fun of me? Do you know how terrible it was? They've killed almost every man… Those who survived ran to find backup… They had the courage to go outside, by the way!]]></string>
<string id="514442"><![CDATA[What did the soldiers want? ]]></string>
<string id="514443"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="514444"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="514445"><![CDATA[Aha! And here's the good architect. So you came here on your own accord? Willingly? Why no escort?]]></string>
<string id="514446"><![CDATA[I'm not an architect. I'm a bachelor. ]]></string>
<string id="514447"><![CDATA[A bachelor, an architect, who cares! I'm not going to waste my time getting to know you. Tell me, was it you that perforated my men yesterday? Well, now we're gonna perforate you. If you're religious, now is the time to pray.]]></string>
<string id="514448"><![CDATA[You're mistaking me for someone else! ]]></string>
<string id="514449"><![CDATA[Come on, hands on the nape, face to the wall. There, to the car. Hand your personal belongings over. Quick—march! ]]></string>
<string id="514450"><![CDATA[But this is an absolutely absurd! Wait! I'm not the person you were going to shoot! ]]></string>
<string id="514451"><![CDATA[Fine. But not to the car, take me to the Steppe. I want to have a smoke before I die... ]]></string>
<string id="514452"><![CDATA[Are you out of your mind? I want to see your superior officer, Alexander Block. ]]></string>
<string id="514453"><![CDATA[Your Block is not our superior. He was only just appointed to be our commander. So don't run complaining to him, we don't take orders from the guy.]]></string>
<string id="514454"><![CDATA[You're making a terrible mistake. ]]></string>
<string id="514455"><![CDATA[This reeks of a court martial, officer. ]]></string>

<string id="514459"><![CDATA[I did. Now what?]]></string>
<string id="514460"><![CDATA[I want to see Alexander Block. If he finds out whom you have shot, you'll be standing against that wall in an hour.]]></string>

<string id="514465"><![CDATA[No. I haven't seen him. ]]></string>
<string id="514466"><![CDATA[Right, yesterday he stood up for me and killed an officer... So the den denizens have been waiting all night long for the soldiers to come… But no one has, until dawn… As for me, yeah, I've had visitors all right! But I haven't found a trace of them here…]]></string>
<string id="514467"><![CDATA[I'll check the pub up.]]></string>
<string id="514474"><![CDATA[I won't make it if the flower falls down… I should have passed away yesterday. Now I'll be bound to roam this vale of tears—worthless… powerless… restless like a ghost…]]></string>
<string id="514475"><![CDATA[Peter, what's happening to the Kains? What does your Tower have to do with it? Tell me—you know them well, after all…]]></string>
<string id="514476"><![CDATA[Do you believe in the existence of the immortal soul? ]]></string>
<string id="514477"><![CDATA[I do.]]></string>
<string id="514478"><![CDATA[It just so happens that Maria believes in it fervently. Khan fancies my creation, but he only sees optical tricks in it and is reluctant to admit to its other qualities. But Maria… Maria believes that the Polyhedron can hold to the glint of a deceased person's soul. The Kains call it "memory".]]></string>
<string id="514479"><![CDATA[She wants to lodge Simon's soul into the Polyhedron?]]></string>
<string id="514480"><![CDATA[Repeatedly reflected by reflections of reflections, disconnected from the ground, endlessly soaring between the firmament and the void… Yes. The Polyhedron was intended for Simon. It will become a shrine for the Kains—a shrine where they'll be able to turn to him for advice to prepare for their future achievements.]]></string>
<string id="514481"><![CDATA[What does it mean? ]]></string>
<string id="514482"><![CDATA[A man in fact is not the master of his inspiration. Inspiration is sent from above. It just so happened that all these years is has been coming from Simon… and from Nina, of course. I have a feeling that Maria has successfully executed an intricate scheme. Involuntarily, perhaps... but what's done is done.]]></string>
<string id="514483"><![CDATA[What scheme? ]]></string>
<string id="514484"><![CDATA[An intricate one. You are aware that Victor and Georgiy are already dead, right?]]></string>
<string id="514485"><![CDATA[You are mistaken. They're still alive. ]]></string>
<string id="514486"><![CDATA[The senior Kains are no more. They've spent their whole life force to hold on to the memory of their beloved departed. The memory that has no Focus… because of us. Both of them are merely bodies now—inhabited by different souls.]]></string>
<string id="514487"><![CDATA[Whose souls? ]]></string>
<string id="514488"><![CDATA[Georgiy is holding on to Simon, Victor—to his beloved spouse, Nina Kaina, who had to be moved away from the Focus of the Crucible when Simon had left his body. But it's too confined for Simon. This house diminishes him.]]></string>
<string id="514489"><![CDATA[Peter, you look unusually sober. I wouldn't have been surprised to hear something like this from you yesterday, but now…]]></string>
<string id="514490"><![CDATA[Drivel. Childish fantasies! I don't believe this.]]></string>
<string id="514491"><![CDATA[I don't understand how exctly it works. It this magic? ]]></string>
<string id="514492"><![CDATA[You can call it magic, but it's actually very simple and logical. In order to accept this much data—a whole living being, the essense of a departed person—you have to surrender your own life. As they say, you can't fit two I's beneath the same roof.]]></string>
<string id="514493"><![CDATA[.. What happened? ]]></string>
<string id="514494"><![CDATA[What is "memory" for the Kains? ]]></string>
<string id="514495"><![CDATA[A person dies. The memory of him keeps living for as long as his way of thinking and loving is remembered, but more importantly—he lives for as long as the power emanating from him is remembered and sensed. The power that inspires the exhausted. The power that strengthens the doubters. That is, if the memory is of a great person, of course...]]></string>
<string id="514496"><![CDATA[Are you trying to tell me that that's what a soul is?]]></string>
<string id="514497"><![CDATA[No. This is only an echo of a soul. A reflection. Do you really think that crafty optics can capture the immortal soul? A mere echo… But a deceased mother is alive to her children for as long as they remember the details of her life. And every second she's dripping away from them—because they forget.]]></string>
<string id="514498"><![CDATA[But how can an edifice keep the memory of Simon? ]]></string>
<string id="514499"><![CDATA[I don't.]]></string>
<string id="514500"><![CDATA[We'll see how it pans out.]]></string>
<string id="514501"><![CDATA[What? Your bloody Tower is what had started all this!]]></string>
<string id="514502"><![CDATA[Oh, please help Andrey! Offer them me in exchange... just don't leave him! ]]></string>
<string id="514503"><![CDATA[Don't be afraid. A student never leaves his peer in trouble. ]]></string>
<string id="514504"><![CDATA[Fine. So you want to look at the foundation blueprints? Go ahead. As luck would have it, they're on me now.]]></string>
<string id="514505"><![CDATA[Thank you very much.]]></string>
<string id="514506"><![CDATA[No. I've no idea how much one has to drink to belch out a something like this. A construction like this is a waste of time and resources.]]></string>
<string id="514508"><![CDATA[Actually, I only need the blueprints of the foundation to report to the Inquisitor.]]></string>
<string id="514509"><![CDATA[Go back to your medicine, Dankovsky. And never judge the things you have no idea about! ]]></string>
<string id="514510"><![CDATA[Go back to hell. ]]></string>
<string id="514511"><![CDATA[Show me the blueprints. ]]></string>
<string id="514512"><![CDATA[No way in hell. Your words were offensive.]]></string>
<string id="514513"><![CDATA[Sooner or later you will... ]]></string>

<string id="514518"><![CDATA[Oh, sure. I won't take a step out of bed without you...]]></string>
<string id="514524"><![CDATA[Please come and see me at the Crucible. We have a matter of utmost importance to discuss. What I am to tell you will be of use to your cause, and will help you to recover from today's failure. All is not lost, Bachelor!

<string id="514530"><![CDATA[Your nemesis is breathing down your neck. Look behind you, before it's too late!

She donned the mask of justice, playing skillfully with your desire to uncover the truth! She has abused you, made you a tool, forced you to create more lies. Dark passions and thirst for vengeance are poor companions for people like her.

Find me at the Commander's headquarters if you wish to know more. It is sad to see how easily she has tricked you, what with me thinking you were a geometrician and a strategist of no small standing.

<string id="514960"><![CDATA[Look! It's a magic sandbox! See how it reflects in the mirrors? It's because everything's for real there! Here's a town, we've made it out of sand. And there's this awful thing going on there—an EPIDEMIC! So it's all crumbling… the town is falling apart… But we've sent heroes there to fix it.]]></string>
<string id="514961"><![CDATA[To fix it?]]></string>
<string id="514962"><![CDATA[It's rotting, see...? Eww. We hoped they'd think of something. Mure it in sand, at least… They're magical to, you know, the heroes are! Take you, for example—look how it all worked out! You used to be a doll and now you're alive. Perhaps the rest also work like this?]]></string>
<string id="514963"><![CDATA[Did you know that your dolls were alive?]]></string>
<string id="514964"><![CDATA[Everything is alive around here! It's this structure, it brings things to life. it's not like we're twisting anyone's arm... It just happens. All on its own. We only built the town—and then it became miraculous all on its own! And the dolls… We just stuck the throwaway ones in, they were lame anyway. Oops, sorry...]]></string>

<string id="514969"><![CDATA[Heal the town, please! Just look, it's so wonderful... It's alive and it's our favourite one... We won't be able to make another one like this. If it can't be helped, then it will disappear forever. You know how much we love it?]]></string>

<string id="515007"><![CDATA[Well, we did need to find some use for you. We never liked you all that much anyway… You've always been the scary doll. Playing with you was no fun.]]></string>
<string id="515008"><![CDATA[...So you stuck the throwaways into the thick of it.]]></string>
<string id="515009"><![CDATA[The ones that could fix things! You can't always have a Smart Doctor Man at hand. That's just how the game goes. Will you help us heal the town?]]></string>

<string id="515012"><![CDATA[Get the Commander out of there then.]]></string>

<string id="515061"><![CDATA[It's me, the player.]]></string>
<string id="515062"><![CDATA[Oh! Then I apologise profusely... You are definitely not a doll, but that seems to be unhelpful for our hero now.

<string id="515063"><![CDATA[Yes. He is my responsibility. I will stay with him to the very end. His words shall be my words. His deeds shall be my deeds.]]></string>

<string id="515066"><![CDATA[Yes. And highlight Bachelor Dankovsky better. It's my solo now!]]></string>

<string id="515074"><![CDATA[Tell me—who are you in this puppet world? ]]></string>
<string id="515075"><![CDATA[We do not belong to the puppet shows. We are the actors of a mime performance. I, for example, am a Miserable actor.

<string id="515340"><![CDATA[The disease has evaded us twice already, but now it is firmly within our grasp. All we require is a heart that contains the living pathogen. They say that Burakh is a virtuoso of the scalpel, so I merely need Olgimsky to introduce us.]]></string>
<string id="515341"><![CDATA[Lara Ravel has informed Olgimsky of Burakh's capture by Saburov's people. Now Burakh is on death row, if Saburov has not already executed him. Saburov has a well known habit of jumping to conclusions. It wouldn't surprise me if he accuses Burakh of Isidor's murder. Either way, if Burakh is still alive then it may be worthwhile to help him out of jail, insofar as he may be of use to us yet.]]></string>
<string id="515342"><![CDATA[Katerina was unable to contain herself. Her ramblings gave her away. According to her, Burakh is held near his own hideout, the house across the street, perhaps? There is another, though; a witness of him being arrested—one of Lara Ravel's friends.]]></string>
<string id="515343"><![CDATA[Burakh is somewhere in the Works. There are quite a few separate workshops there. With all the information I have collected, finding him shouldn't be that much trouble.]]></string>
<string id="515344"><![CDATA[The soldier gave me a good idea. If the thieves are so mad at the patrolmen, then why not let them do the dirty work for us? I need to talk with Bad Grief about it. If I deal with these people myself, Saburov will surely put me in pole position on his extermination list.]]></string>
<string id="515345"><![CDATA[That does it; there is no time to spare. I will have to meet with Burakh at once; before my associates are done with their ungentlemanly assignment. Otherwise we will have to undertake this cat and mouse chase throughout the town once again.]]></string>

<string id="515355"><![CDATA[I can't help but remember one gut-wrenching old story. There was a travelling circus known as the "Ace of Diamonds Caravan" who were—allegedly—kidnapping small children and turning them into monsters. Anna advises that we try and profit from the situation; that we might blackmail a good deal of money out of that hunchbacked usurer.]]></string>
<string id="515356"><![CDATA[The hunchbacked fire eater—or whoever he was back in the day—has a heart. I wonder what kind of relationship he has with his daughter, as I detect a lecherous undertone beneath the worry in his voice. Either way, he clearly wants to have his daughter back. I wonder what Anna could reveal on this matter...]]></string>
<string id="515357"><![CDATA[The daughter had a traditional circus upbringing. What her father doesn't know is that she is working as a dancer in a twyrine shebeen. But why doesn't he know this? Is he disillusioned with the Caravan to such an extent that he wants to wipe the slate clean? Either way, I should talk with the daughter myself.]]></string>
<string id="515358"><![CDATA[The girl has agreed to meet me at nine, in the place that we discussed. It is clear that there is more to her story than immediately meets the eye, but the circus performers were reluctant to indulge any information to me. Could it be that I am walking into a trap? A risky move, but I am not so naive as to not see it coming.]]></string>
<string id="515359"><![CDATA[*** An unexpected denouement. The girl is dead and the Hunchback is out of his mind with grief. He is working to gather a mob of supporters with the intention of razing the entire town to the ground. A band of blood-crazed arsonists is the last thing this town needs! All because of me. Oh, how the Inquisitor would approve...]]></string>
<string id="515360"><![CDATA[Here lives the Hunchback, who turned out to be Anna's accomplice from her Caravan times… Or was he just an accomplice? Who knows what kind of relationship those two had…]]></string>
<string id="515361"><![CDATA[Anna has resorted to blackmail trying to pay off the people who are supposedly threatening her. Whatever the hunchbacked arsonist gives, she's willing to split the sum.]]></string>
<string id="515362"><![CDATA[The Hunchback is willing to give a hefty sum, but for a different reason. He asked me to find his beloved daughter. I wonder who a Caravan fire-eater would refer to as a daughter, though.]]></string>
<string id="515363"><![CDATA[It seems the Hunchback's daughter has been visiting this wonderful establishment at night. Is that really something a behaved child would do? I sense foul play…]]></string>

<string id="515435"><![CDATA[Aglaya has briefly studied the evidence and concluded that the bacteria are of mineral origin. Now that I think of it, it does seem plausible. Vlad the Younger has agreed to help us follow up on this hypothesis. It's about time I found out what he is using his well for.]]></string>
<string id="515436"><![CDATA[Enough! It's time to bring the Olgimsky family out into the open. I could easily find common ground with Aspity, however disagreeable she may be. She is rather loquacious and she let slip that the protector of the Kin has an axe to grind with the Olgimskys. Aspity is not so good a liar that I couldn't see right through her.]]></string>
<string id="515437"><![CDATA[The whole thing proved to be a trivial affair, but no less terrifying for it. When Isidor informed the Olgimskys of the impending outbreak, it was the younger who did what the elder did not dare to. But as the consequences became known, it was the father who shielded his son from the ramifications. A double deceit. This being known, I am in a strong position to speak with the Olgimskys.]]></string>
<string id="515438"><![CDATA[Dear Doctor,

The Termitary is open. Nothing bars your passage inside... I beg your forgiveness for having concealed the true purpose of the blockade. I am guilty indeed, but whatever I have done, I was acting in good faith and with good intentions.

Vlad Olgimsky]]></string>

<string id="515441"><![CDATA[What remains of The Kin—those who were so large in number, but are now regrettably scarce—still follow the whims of one little girl. This little girl now demands the surrender of whoever caused the wholesale death that took place in the Termitary. Her intentions are clear, but what am I to do next? This is the question.]]></string>
<string id="515442"><![CDATA[The mistress of the Termitary is unhappy with the living toys she has. She wants another toy—a  new favourite one. Were I to assist in the acquisition of such a toy, she has agreed to grant me entrance to the Abattoir, where the bowels of the earth will reveal their secrets to me. Truth be told, I am not looking forward to going there.]]></string>
<string id="515443"><![CDATA[The Mother Superior will grant me passage into the Abattoir. The central entrance—used normally by the workers—will open soon after dark.]]></string>

<string id="515446"><![CDATA[As long as I have been here, it seems the Tower has remained completely untouched by the disease. Even so, it does not escape the scrutiny. The Inquisitor has tasked me with its investigatation; an untainted appearance will not suffice. Only Victor's son, Khan, is able to let me inside the Polyhedron, but rumour has it that Victor no longer holds any influence over his son.]]></string>
<string id="515447"><![CDATA[Apparently, Khan wants to play soldier. He may be a child, but he speaks in a manner beyond his years. What could he possibly want with five rifles? I refuse to believe he would be so irresponsible as to exchange fire with the entirety of General Ashes' artillery. Regardless, if it is five rifles that will get me inside the Tower, then so be it.]]></string>
<string id="515448"><![CDATA[*** The Polyhedron is clear. But what is the nature of it? It appears as if it was built of a dream, a vision of itself... The children do say that it can capture a reverie and make it reality. I wouldn't believe such a thing, if I hadn't seen these paper constructions with my own eyes.]]></string>
<string id="515449"><![CDATA["Clarity and Focus"]]></string>
<string id="515450"><![CDATA[Aglaya has taken an interest in the Polyhedron. She says that it is too unusual to exist. Yet there it stands, no mere imaginary construct. How can she dismiss it so easily, what with all the children living inside? Only Peter Stamatin—the architect of the Tower—will have the answer to the puzzle.]]></string>

<string id="515455"><![CDATA[We're here on duty, kind sir. So you're the offender's friend, then? Or an accomplice?]]></string>
<string id="515456"><![CDATA[I am his friend. ]]></string>
<string id="515457"><![CDATA[Then it should be of interest to you that your friend is to be held responsible for the crime of murder in cold blood of four servicemen. Our informer has indicated that the murderous architect resides in this very house. The sentence is to be executed immediately. And now you are going to tell me where the offender can be found.]]></string>
<string id="515458"><![CDATA[But Peter is not guilty! He couldn't have murdered a person!]]></string>
<string id="515459"><![CDATA[We have provided you with all the necessary explanations. What else do you want?]]></string>
<string id="515460"><![CDATA[Vacate the building. This is an architect's study, not a barrack.]]></string>

<string id="515469"><![CDATA[Here you go. Carefully, or they'll catch fire. Have you seen how it burns, by the way? It's a feuer-werk! The flame of deep green, navy, purple, crimson, black! You're going to see it now… ]]></string>
<string id="515472"><![CDATA[I'll help her, Peter. Do not give up so easily. Come out of the pyre.]]></string>
<string id="515473"><![CDATA[So they decided to get rid of Peter after all? What does Andrey have to say on the matter? I'd like to hear him boast now of how he cares for his emotionally fragile sibling. I must find Peter before he does anything reckless, like burn any evidence of his work. He must be hiding somewhere in town... but where?]]></string>
<string id="515474"><![CDATA[Peter has requested five bottles of twyrine. With these, he plans to kill himself. His request, however, provides me with much needed time to delay. The main thing of course is to prevent him from burning his designs…]]></string>
<string id="515475"><![CDATA[I have recovered the priceless designs. I should take them to the Inquisitor immediately.]]></string>
<string id="515476"><![CDATA[*** We should give no heed to rumours and hearsay. These manuscripts and these designs are the work of a restless genius. They are erratic, spontaneous and incoherent... Hopefully Aglaya will be able to unpick their meaning. I am sure there is a deep seated, rational explanation behind it all.]]></string>
<string id="515477"><![CDATA["The Foundation of a Miracle"]]></string>
<string id="515478"><![CDATA[How in the world is this building supported when the very nature of it is insupportable? Perhaps the staircase itself is a form of reciprocal frame on which the whole thing rests. Perhaps it is the complete opposite. The base of the building is not a structural support, but instead an anchor to hold this floating structure to the earth in the way of a stepladder thrown from a dirigible.]]></string>
<string id="515479"><![CDATA[Andrey Stamatin—the last architect daring enough to reject the fundamental laws—has been brought before the firing squad. They took him out to where the cannon is parked at the stand-by railway and then shot him. A symbolic gesture if ever there was one; a testament to the construction of destructive artillery while they demolish the creator of inconceivable edifices.]]></string>
<string id="515480"><![CDATA[I have unearthed the basis of the miracle... In order to support the Tower, the spire was drilled precariously deep into the earth. The consequences of this are most dire. I should take the designs to the Inquisitor.]]></string>
<string id="515481"><![CDATA[*** The very soil on which the town is built is seeping with poison. The construction of the Tower had uncovered something that was laying in wait. The cause of the outbreak is clear now; it is a systematic certainty. Does this mean, however, that we must destroy the Tower? This dying town is already beyond salvation, but the Polyhedron—this epitome of human aspiration—may be saved...]]></string>
<string id="515482"><![CDATA[According to one of the girls at the den, the soldiers who took Andrey let it slip that this is where they conduct executions.]]></string>
<string id="515483"><![CDATA[I have examined the blueprints. They seem to be lacking one crucially important detail.

Our time has come, it seems. I would rather abstain from any conclusions, and allow you to come to them yourself.

Please see me at the Cathedral for the final meeting.

<string id="515487"><![CDATA[There was a riot at the Bone Stake Lot yesterday. The revolters killed fifteen soldiers and the local authorities have arrested those charged with inciting the disturbance. They are liable to face execution at the hands of the firing squad.

<string id="515488"><![CDATA[Bachelor!

We thought we should write, because you don't seem to be listening to what we tell you! You've gotten out of hand!

As of late you keep doing whatever you please. This is unacceptable. You are spoiling the game.

If this letter reaches you in good time, do come to the Polyhedron. They will let you inside. Keep your eyes tightly closed, descend to the bottom,  and say: "Three, four, five." Open your eyes.

We'd like to have a little chat with you.

<string id="515491"><![CDATA[A Letter from the Makers]]></string>
<string id="515492"><![CDATA[Tonight at seven, proceedings will be held at the town Cathedral.

I earnestly request your attendance. You will introduce your argument before this obtuse Commander in order to substantiate your—our, I should hope—decision.

I also ask you to put all your current affairs in order before the proceedings. The situation is at a stalemate; whatever authority I wield is not enough to guarantee that the right decision is enforced.

P.S. I rely upon your discretion, as well as your decency.

<string id="515500"><![CDATA[Bachelor has lost his battle for freedom since the very day he was born. What about you?]]></string>
<string id="515501"><![CDATA[I wanted to stop the epidemic. Even a make-believe one.]]></string>
<string id="515502"><![CDATA[But did you understand what the epidemic really was? It was truly rather obvious…]]></string>
<string id="515503"><![CDATA[A toy danger that has ravaged a toy town.]]></string>
<string id="515504"><![CDATA[Was the disease the true evil though? The disease is only a method. The weapon of evil—just like a scalpel in Bachelor's hands. The disease will go, devouring itself. Then there'll be war, famine, heresy. Was it really worth all the effort? Look around.]]></string>
<string id="515505"><![CDATA[All this—for a single wretched town?]]></string>
<string id="515506"><![CDATA[No. It was the town that had been built for you, not the other way round. We apologize if it's been a disappointment.]]></string>
<string id="515507"><![CDATA[I still don't get it.]]></string>
<string id="515508"><![CDATA[It had been built so that you could make your final choice now. We are observing you. Everyone who makes it to midnight will have made a choice—one way or another. We want to see what yours looks like. You stll have a chance to change your mind.]]></string>
<string id="515509"><![CDATA[I've made it already. I know what to do.]]></string>
<string id="515510"><![CDATA[Good—if it really is you who knows it. We are observing you. We believe that we have a common goal—we want to know if the impossible may be possible.]]></string>

<string id="515516"><![CDATA[Could it have been otherwise?]]></string>
<string id="515517"><![CDATA[Oh, absolutely. When every step you take has been predicted, you are still free to either take it or not. When it has been foreseen, however, you remain a mere puppet in someone else's hands.]]></string>

<string id="515527"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="515528"><![CDATA[Yulia Lyuricheva's take on him:
"He is a husband worthy of his wife. Whatever power each one of the ruling houses possesses is predicated upon a kind of dependable amalgamation between the preternatural power wielded by the Mistress and the magisterial injunctions issued by the head of the family. However, Katerina is known to be sterile, which leaves Saburov with nothing but brute domineering. As soon as the moment is right, Saburov will attempt to seize absolute administrative power. In so doing he will compensate himself for the debilitating misery of his spouse."

Rubin's take:
"Alexander is a hero. When fire broke out in the Skinners, he took a pike pole into his own hands to break into burning houses, save people, and put out fire. That's just how it was. Curiously enough, he kept his incognito back then and emerged from the ordeal unrecognized; neither did he flaunt his feat later. The truth came out accidentally. That is a very typical situation; Alexander is just that—an everyday hero who often demands no credit. It's a very unique kind of heroism."]]></string>
<string id="515529"><![CDATA[Maria's take on him:
"I am quite fond of Andrey. The twins are the two sides of a single whole, but Andrey has the capability to execute Peter's fantasies and designs. He is resolute enough not only to admit the possibility of the impossible, but also to implement it through persistent creative work. My uncle is quite capable of the former too, but the latter...! A personality like Andrey's deserves nothing but admiration..."

Vlad the Younger's take:
"Without Andrey's boldness, Peter's vivid imagination would have only existed on paper. It's a shame that the duo is in decline right now, really. Peter is a habitual drinker and Andrey wastes his life on debauchery and ruthless feasts. But dormant periods are common among creative people; they emerge from them carrying the prey of new discoveries in their teeth..."]]></string>
<string id="515530"><![CDATA[Peter Stamatin's take on her:
"The poor thing has lost her voice. I sympathize with her because she keeps her chin up, and I hate whiners. I'm thoroughly convinced that she's paying the price for someone else's sin; a haunting visitor eager to rip out her soul is coming after her any day now. At least that's what she thinks. A lesser person wouldn't have managed to endure such torture."

Yulia Lyuricheva's take:
"Anna affects to be suffering, but her hypocrisy is all too easy to see through. If she was genuinely wanted—for her involvement with the February Riots, or that Caravan of kidnappers—she would have been found years ago. She is able to trick her destiny for now, but her luck will run dry soon enough. The Ace of Diamonds Caravan has left a ghastly imprint on her, the way it did with everything it was linked to... yet the nature of the link between the caravan and Anna remains a mystery."]]></string>
<string id="515531"><![CDATA[Alexander's take on him:
"Vlad is a cunning and unfriendly man. Dealing with him is tough. I find it odd that he runs the Kin so smoothly. Civilized people can't usually find a common tongue with our Steppe people; you have to turn into a beast regularly in order to communicate with them. I think they've stricken some sort of secret pact; this peace has to have a hefty price."

Victor's take:
"The town prospers thanks to his acumen. He watches over the arteries and has a firm hold over the economy. The Abattoir, the factories, the warehouses; the trading processes themselves are completely under his control. Saburov and I have long abandoned our attempts to interfere with his domain; we don't have the slightest idea of The Bull Project's day-to-day life. I wouldn't be surprised to find out one day that Vlad had installed slavery there."]]></string>
<string id="515532"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="515533"><![CDATA[Peter Stamatin's take on her:
"She came to love my creation when it was but a sketch. People are often astonished by it, but rarely is it met with love. Even the children merely tolerate it. Loving an edifice like this demands vivid and outstanding imagination..."

Victor Kain's take:
"Eva possesses some virtues that my daughter, unfortunately, does not. She is gentle. She is trustworthy. She wouldn't ever stoop to betrayal. She could be the Soul of a Focus, were she not enamoured of death so bizarrely and persistently."]]></string>
<string id="515534"><![CDATA[Yulia's take on him:
"A potent mind to say the least. Encyclopaedically educated, well versed in Mathematics and Physics, has appreciable background in Astronomy. With all that, his chosen field of study is decidedly occult. And it is impossible to disregard how successful he is at that. However awkward it may appear at first glance, the quotidian and the numinous often complement each other very well."

Alexander Saburov's take:
"Georgiy is no successor to Simon. Semblance in appearances doesn't necessarily imply internal likeness. Kain is too deranged to be a good ruler. Were he, say, to rule our country, he would have turned it into some kind of theocracy."]]></string>
<string id="515535"><![CDATA[Peter Stamatin's take on him:
"What is he? A storekeeper that neither keeps nor stores. He's got a whole community of birds of his feather there. Somehow they manage the warehouse business past Big Vlad's pocket. They accept twyre-gatherers and throat-cutters as their brethren; uncharacteristically of the locals, sometimes they put their knives to use. But really, their twyrine is something else..."

Vlad the Younger's take:
"His real name is Grigory Filin. The thieves call him Big Bad Grief, even though he's merely a nuisance. Grief is the kingpin of the shady world. Name any prohibited item—and rest assured they're selling it. Father has no choice but to tolerate him; somehow these loafers managed to get a firm hold over the workmen community. If only we had direct communication options with them, there would be no need for those parasite middlemen... or should I say meddlemen?"]]></string>
<string id="515536"><![CDATA[Eva Yan's take on him:
"Kaspar is the dark leader of the children. He has a lot of followers. An extraordinarily courageous boy; that alone is reason enough to respect him. Like all Kains, he's been practising Novel Art since childhood. He is privy to mysteries that often turn out to be genuine and effective. It's not often that he refers to them, sharing the knowledge quite unwillingly. Capella and he are the rulers of the children's world in our town."

Katerina Saburova's take:
"He is an ivory-tower mandrake, born and bred. An imperious and smart boy that's been offered an opportunity to do deeds of an epic scale, without any regard for the price that will have to be paid for them."]]></string>
<string id="515537"><![CDATA[Eva Yan's take on her:
"Yulia is a very smart person, I could never match her intelligence. She's quiet and humble... and perfect. She also possesses a very unique kind of spiritual austerity and purity; she sets the bar higher for herself than for the rest. Yulia has a very intricate way of thinking. I could never learn to think like she does..."

Lara's take:
"I find Yulia very nice, but I can't stand the way she thinks. This fatalism of hers is depressing and crushing, and it's appaling to see a mind that bright base its theories upon a false foundation. I believe that any predetermination is an insult to the freedom of choice. I guess it all goes back to the past, when she worked with the Dream Party."]]></string>
<string id="515538"><![CDATA[Maria's take on her:
"Oh, I admire Capella. Khan and she hold absolute power over the minds of the children. However, my surly brother is indelicate and spiteful... while Capella is smart and gentle. Khan lures them in with the liberty to do whatever they will; Capella does so with love. I'd be glad to see her become the White Mistress."

Vlad the Younger's take:
"Capella is to the children what Maria is to us. Wherever she appears, children go crazy, as if they were given an adrenaline shot straight to the heart. The only thing that confuses me is the promises of a new life that she tries to hammer into their heads. She claims to be a priestess—but what gave her the right? Her mother's blood? No. She will not grow to be a Mistress."]]></string>
<string id="515539"><![CDATA[Aspity's take on her:
"A queen turned witch. That's what you get for dabbling with the spirits of the night. After Nina died, Katerina shamelessly rushed to take the place of the Dark Mistress; the burden of caring for the town was Victoria's, so petty games were still allowed. She got carried away though... Rumour has it, she needs daily morphine injections and welcomes cold-skinned visitors in her alcove at night..."

Lara's take:
"Katerina took a hard hit and managed to pull through. Who could survive between Nina's rock and Victoria's hard place? That's how the town worked back then—upon this rock Nina was forging it, while Victoria maintained a firm stance to keep it in check; Katerina was the one to ensure the balance was in place. I also admire how much Alexander and she love each other. They could have been the grand kings of old—noble, resolute, and honest. Now is simply the wrong time for them."]]></string>
<string id="515540"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="515541"><![CDATA[Capella's take on her:
"She's the kindest person I know. Lara has taught me how to give presents, which is an intricate art in and of itself. The first thing she cares about is other people; the last is Lara Ravel herself. She lives for her friends. I also was fond of her father. The year before last he volunteered as a Fourth Army captain. Yes, I mean the Fourth Army."

Stanislav Rubin's take:
"After captain Ravel was shot during the battle of Karstov Fords, newly-orphaned Lara turned her father's house into The Shelter. The house that's been built by Olgimsky in exchange for... a favour. She is both sensitive and sensible; a rare combination in our neck of the woods."]]></string>
<string id="515542"><![CDATA[Katerina's take on her:
"She speaks to the dead. Sometimes you can find her sitting by a grave and humming a lullaby. She offers them gifts too, quite unusual sometimes: typewriter carriages, say, of birthday cakes with candles lit. She obviously has a great affinity for music, but plays no instruments. Her singing is enchanting but raspy, as if she was short of breath."

Aspity's take:
"Grace is nuts, plain and simple. You can easily recognize her by the breath; she inhales deeply, loudly, and... hoarsely, as though it's hard for her to take air in or as though she was about to break into tears. Her breath is fresh though, clean, even sweet-scented somewhat. That is actually rather uncanny considering her line of trade. And she talks to me as though I were dead too."]]></string>
<string id="515543"><![CDATA[Andrey Stamatin's take on her:
"Maria is concealing her true power for the time being, but it has already become apparent that she will stop at nothing when the time comes. Her sheer power will justify any despotism that would spring from it. The brilliance of her talent is going to surpass even Nina's one day. Maria will be grabbing stars by the handful while sipping earth's magma. And that means there are still things in this world worth living and hoping for!"

Katerina's take:
"Whenever I imagine what this town is going to become when she grows up, I feel nothing but dread. It took all of us to hold Nina the Terrible back—Victoria, me, and even the Kains themselves. Little Victoria will not be able to stand up to Maria on her own; I will not be staying in this world for much longer; and Victor adores her... so who will harness the midnight filly?"]]></string>
<string id="515544"><![CDATA[Lara Ravel's take on him:
"I think it's the Masks who play him and not the other way around. This Theatre generally gives me a dark vibe... I can't really put it into words. It's not a theatre, but rather a well pretending to be one. It's intimidating. Also, Mark's mime shows seem to incorporate us, too... everyone's playing along to avoid disrupting the performance, and that's exactly how he's manipulating us."

Maria's take:
"He makes me anxious; his performances don't show a person's fate, they impose it. I'd really like to see someone grab and pull the puppeteer's strings! Or maybe we ought to loop the whole thing, offering the strings to the people at the very bottom? That would be funny... All in all, one day I shall tame this crafty imp—no matter what it takes!"]]></string>
<string id="515545"><![CDATA[Capella's take on her:
"She's very young, almost a baby… Her game in the Polyhedron was generally the same; she also assumed the role of a divine child that was worshipped and looked after not out of duty, but simply because taking care of someone that lovely brings you satisfaction and joy."

And also:
"The children happily picked her game up because Mother had a lot of information about the Kin—the world that's always been poles apart from the Polyhedron..."]]></string>
<string id="515546"><![CDATA[Sticky's take on her:
"We're friends with Murky, even though she's just a little tot. I'll have you know that she's actually very independent. One thing Murky is seriously fond of is digging and playing in the mud. You can also sometimes see her push along somewhere looking all preoccupied—and the places she chooses are usually, like, sinister... I respect that."

Grace's take:
"Little Murky is an orphan. Her mom and dad lie by the eastern wall here. They died five years ago. I don't know why—they won't tell me, they're always weeping. As for her eating dirt, that's untrue. I've never seen it."]]></string>
<string id="515547"><![CDATA[Lara Ravel's take on him:
"Why does nobody notice how hardworking he is? He works all the time! Everything he does, he does for the family, even if his father won't admit it. Yes, he chose to study the Kin instead of the intricacies of economy—and he already knows it way better than his father. He'll grow to be a better manager and a better ruler that would make do without a whip, violence, abuse, victims, and riots..."

Vlad Olgimsky's take:
"A high-stepper! Instead of settling down and helping me manage the industry, he'd rather dabble in the local fairytales! This loafer's most refined skill is wasting my money. He's rather quick-witted when it comes to business, I'll grant him that; all the more shame on him for casting everything on his father. And to think he took after me!"]]></string>
<string id="515548"><![CDATA[Capella's take on him:
"Notkin used to be Khan's best friend. I don't know what their quarrel was about, but most likely it was about Notkin not wanting to dance to his whistle. For what it's worth, they also say that he was banished from the Polyhedron by the Mother Superior—before she returned to the orphaned Termitary."

Khan's take:
"After Mother left, we invited him back, but he, in his pride, refused. Instead he chose to dig a lair by the Warehouses and play the "Soul-and-a-Halves". A dangerous game, seeing how Grief isn't afraid of Father in the slightest. Notkin took a risk, but that drew other misfits to him. And that's how they started their slummy society."]]></string>
<string id="515549"><![CDATA[Katerina's take on her:
"However odd, Aspity is a good person. She talks about death all the time. She asked me once why there is no Saburova Tomb at the Stone Yard cape and when it was about to appear—and she looked so innocent! She respects me as a Mistress, and that is something I cannot simply brush aside, especially since my followers abandon and betray me with each passing day..."

Sticky's take:
"Such a mysterious creature! No one knows how she came to be in the town. Unlike others, she's not in danger because she's immortal like Simon. They also say that after Simon had cast off all that was evil in his heart, the Steppe provided bones for her body, and that's how Aspity was born!"]]></string>
<string id="515550"><![CDATA[Anna Angel's take on him:
"While it's common consensus that both of them are brilliant, you don't need to be the brightest tool in the shed to see that Peter is the real genius. Such people are only born once a century. Not that I deny Andrey his talent… But Peter has drowned his gift in twyrine long ago, and it's become glaringly obvious that Andrey is nothing without him. Now Andrey believes that it is his duty to protect Peter and serve as a middleman between the harsh reality and the drunkard brother!"

Alexander Saburov's take:
"Both of them are rabid villains! Bonus points to Peter for also being a murderer. No matter what his creative achievements are, I would have ended him long ago, were he not almost completely mentally deranged. Wild, cruel, disruptive; four hundred years ago this type of artists were more than satisfied with using a knife for a brush and blood for paint! This is the kind of people that believe that creativity absolves any sin!"]]></string>
<string id="515551"><![CDATA[Alexander Saburov's take on him:
"A strong person in every sense of the word. He can break your neck or set your dislocated joint equally easily. A very gifted autodidact. His main concern is the others, never the man himself. A selfless man. A man of principle. Someone you can always rely on."

Vlad Olgimsky's take:
"He was old Burakh's best student. Wilful. Headstrong. Sturdy. He will always do what he believes to be the right thing and be stubborn as a mule about it. It's almost impossible to find a common tongue with him. He doesn't respect any authority except for that of his precious master..."]]></string>
<string id="515552"><![CDATA[Bad Grief's take on him:
"Now that's what I call good thievin'! A nimble lad, he is. Snatchin' a ring off your finger like there's no tomorrow, knowin' all them ins n' outs everywhere... and the lockpicks he makes! Man can always recognize the hand of a true master, dontcha think? I'm totally makin' the lad my minion as soon as I get my hands on him. He's a snappish pup all right, all bark 'n bite both, tryin' to keep away from good old Bad Grief... But who knows—perhaps one day he'll be the heir to the throne of the King of Thieves... It's anyone's guess if I'm really gonna do it."

Capella's take:
"That cryptic creature that he had encountered in some desolated corner of the town has really changed him. It seems to have turned into a mania. The main goal of his adventures used to be a nonexistent hidden treasure, but now he's going crazy for that longneck monster. He's positive that is the last vampire..."]]></string>
<string id="515553"><![CDATA[Vlad the Younger's take on him:
"He's not a hundred percent human. Rumour has it, he's a descendant of bulls. He oversees the work since he comes from a menkhu family. The Abattoir's transformation into a prosperous industrial facility that simultaneously remains a pagan temple only happened due to his efforts. I have no idea how he manages to do it."

Victor Kain's take:
"The lower level of town management is reserved for chtonian creatures indeed—and we cannot simply ignore them. Each of them has established certain reputation within his enclave; the Foreman—in the Abattoir, Bad Grief—in the catacombs beneath the warehouses. You can't really feel their presence in the town itself; it crawls sideways, grabbing those who make an unwitting step towards it with its invisible tentacles. The tentacles being the twyrine market for Grief and the echoes of our town's past for Oyun."]]></string>
<string id="515554"><![CDATA[Yulia Lyuricheva's take on him:
"A new structure of power relationships is being established in the town. Personally, I would have preferred the next triumvirate to be led by Victor. Alas, Victor is utterly loathsome of anything that has to do with fame, authority, or public adoration. He has every right to claim the throne, but he will hand it over to his daughter. Just like he did before, when his terrifying wife was still with us."

Andrey Stamatin's take:
"Victor was the only person who could control Nina the Wild. She obeyed Simon and Georgiy too, but that was only out of respect for the family's strict morals. And yet Nina followed Victor's word unquestionably—although he never demanded that from her. It's all very mysterious. How did he tame the demon and why did he allow her complete and unrestricted freedom?"]]></string>

<string id="515599"><![CDATA[They're too afraid of Bad Grief's thugs—ironically, it is they who volunteered to protect me from honest townsfolk! Search parties swinging firearms and torches have passed through the northern Warehouses a few times. That was close... but I think I'm off the hook for now. Thankfully I've kept this place a secret from anyone save for my apprentices. ]]></string>
<string id="515600"><![CDATA[So you've got them at least, right?]]></string>
<string id="515601"><![CDATA[Two of them did come to help me. I haven't seen either of them since yesterday. I think they've fallen sick. But they managed to get a lot done the other day! I was even able to conduct some tests!]]></string>

<string id="515604"><![CDATA[Unfortunately, I'm not that good at chemistry—a vaccine would call for someone... less crude. The reagents I'm used to would ruin the source specimen; I'm lucky to have my teacher's solutions, at least—they proved to be useful.

<string id="515611"><![CDATA[I tried it already! Didn't you say the bacterium dies along with the blood cells? It is even more drastic than that. The microbe survives for mere moments in its pure state. It splits, it converts the blood cells and it dies. However, a heart muscle...]]></string>
<string id="515612"><![CDATA[How do you mean, its pure state?]]></string>
<string id="515613"><![CDATA[What I mean is, the state the bacterium is in when the immune system begins to fight it. There are several stages of the microbe development. We need to nail the intermediate one.]]></string>
<string id="515614"><![CDATA[What about it?]]></string>
<string id="515615"><![CDATA[If the sickness spreads to the heart, it makes a kind of colony there. I know it may sound ridiculous—I'm not really a scientist, I merely recall the observations I made. An infected heart would allow us to extract the bacteria at its most pure, most potent state; provided we work fast enough.]]></string>

<string id="515619"><![CDATA[The Steppe people are like that, doctor... You don't seem to quite understand the difference between you and... them. They are barely daunted with things that would scare us to death. The blood of a Steppe person belongs to the earth. One way or another, Burakh will be working in the infected quarters today.]]></string>

<string id="515621"><![CDATA[Quite possibly. As his father's successor, he is empowered to open up bodies.

<string id="515727"><![CDATA[I wouldn't know. What I do know, however, is that the dead may be brought back to life by the focussed emotions of the living.

<string id="515728"><![CDATA[That was poetic.]]></string>
<string id="515729"><![CDATA[Quite so. There are people whose memory is merely a sequence of simple melodic fragments. Then, there are those whose memory is more like a symphony.

<string id="517834"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="517835"><![CDATA[Venerable Bachelor? Please be so kind as to linger for a minute. This conversation won't take too much of your time, especially since time stops during dialogues... at least during the important ones. And our dialogue is extremely important! You need to know how to play after all, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="517836"><![CDATA[Play? What are you talking about, Mask Man? I'm neither a gambler nor an actor.]]></string>
<string id="517837"><![CDATA[Of course you aren't! You are a living breathing man—as is evident from your conditions and statuses. You experience hunger, thirst, and fatigue; you suffer from pain, wounds, and diseases. You're so lifelike! You have to eat, drink, sleep, and rest. And to make mistakes...]]></string>
<string id="517838"><![CDATA[The latter being the most definitive proof of my human nature, wouldn't you agree?]]></string>
<string id="517839"><![CDATA[If I may, I would like to point out just how important it is to keep an eye on your condition. If you get dizzy or unnaturally sluggish, do have it checked up... Vital processes tend to run faster during emergencies than in everyday life. I knew a person who died of stress but was diagnosed with starvation...]]></string>
<string id="517840"><![CDATA[It happens. I can testify to that as a doctor.]]></string>
<string id="517841"><![CDATA[Need I remind a wise man like you of the fact that hunger is sated with food? Food can be found in shops, and shops can be found in ordinary houses that are marked with specific signs. Sleep, however, is more complicated. People only sleep in beds and only in private residences around here. I am sorry, but that's just how our world is...]]></string>
<string id="517842"><![CDATA[Yes, the world is unjust.]]></string>
<string id="517843"><![CDATA[And quite silly, if you forgive me for saying so... Speaking of commerce, different shops sell similar items at different prices. Make sure you don't get cheated... people can be quite brazen around here! You can also barter with the folk out in the street. Some things may be nothing more than trinkets to you, but others would be willing to part with their life's blood for them...]]></string>
<string id="517844"><![CDATA[Blood?]]></string>
<string id="517845"><![CDATA[Yes, blood... It's not my place to lecture you, but if—following your Hippocratic oath—you ever consider easing someone's pain, feel free to just approach them with a suitable drug. You will see their pain receding before your very eyes. The sick fall asleep when they're close to recovery, don't they?]]></string>
<string id="517846"><![CDATA[Or when they're close to their ultimate rest.]]></string>
<string id="517847"><![CDATA[Still, helping the hopeless will grant you a good reputation. You will be seen as a benefactor willing to part with a precious sleeping draught or a painkiller for a simple bystander.]]></string>

<string id="517855"><![CDATA[Who are you?]]></string>
<string id="517856"><![CDATA[A poor tragedian, if you please. A victim of circumstances, just like you.]]></string>
<string id="517857"><![CDATA[You are mistaken. I am the director. The person in charge of the situation. I'm not a random actor.]]></string>
<string id="517858"><![CDATA[You look more like a comedian. I don't have time to talk to you.]]></string>
<string id="517859"><![CDATA[Some other time, kind stranger.]]></string>
<string id="517860"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="517861"><![CDATA[Halt! I'm going to have to teach you about the technicalities of the setting. The time and the place. It's non-essential, but that's just how it is—the actor has to be prepared before he goes onstage, or else he'll fall down the aisle or stumble upon the prompt box. That would look mighty silly, wouldn't you agree?]]></string>
<string id="517862"><![CDATA[Speak. I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="517863"><![CDATA[Time flies by. It can't be stopped or turned back. Nights follow days, which are then followed by nights. Things happen without any regard for whether you're there to witness them. Don't expect anyone to wait for you. Most events can be missed.]]></string>
<string id="517864"><![CDATA[And so?]]></string>
<string id="517865"><![CDATA[And so it would make sense for you to visit the places that you care about regularly. You'll find the people that will play major roles in your fate there. They stand out from the common folk; the rest are just a crowd shot, a background, a bunch of extras.]]></string>
<string id="517866"><![CDATA[As it has always been.]]></string>
<string id="517867"><![CDATA[Indeed. Still, it's best to avoid hasty judgement. It's a paradox, you see: don't try to care too much for the lives of these… bound-to-stand-out people. And don't be too dismissive of the silent crowd. Both extremes will end in tragedy.]]></string>
<string id="517868"><![CDATA[Why is that?]]></string>
<string id="517869"><![CDATA[This world cares for your reputation. A fine and crucial instrument. Your reputation changes the world you see—for it is a mirror, wouldn't you agree? And so a bad reputation can get you into a lot of trouble…]]></string>
<string id="517870"><![CDATA[For example?]]></string>
<string id="517871"><![CDATA[Oh, need I describe? You've got vivid imagination… Everything changes, from mystical aspects to mundane things like the people you need treating you badly. How many enemies you've got… How high the prices rise… How bad your dreams are… Lots of things.]]></string>
<string id="517872"><![CDATA[A sorry prospect. So how do I maintain my reputation?]]></string>
<string id="517873"><![CDATA[Really...? How is that even a question? Same as anywhere! Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not lie. Thou shalt not betray. Do not steal… Do not covet… Do not be an asshole. Do not get caught… The rules are the same everywhere. A truly selfless deed—like risking something for thy neighbour or even a person who lives quite far away—can help in a dire situation.]]></string>
<string id="517874"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="517875"><![CDATA[Really? Good for you then. As for me, I can't see anything in this mask. I have no idea what's going on. Anyway, don't get too worked up about human lives. And don't put too much stock into another's words, mine included… He who trusts everyone is asking to be deceived.]]></string>
<string id="517876"><![CDATA[Definitely.]]></string>
<string id="517877"><![CDATA[Yet he who trusts no one is deluded. I know that from experience.]]></string>
<string id="517878"><![CDATA[Speaking of trust, where does Simon Kain reside? I would be most thankful if you showed me the way.]]></string>
<string id="517879"><![CDATA[Simon Kain does not "reside", he lives, or rather exists! He reigns, he creates, he makes mistakes and brings joy to the people with the mere fact of his existence. All that happens at the Crucible. Go left along this alley. As you reach Bridge Square, look to the right. You'll see it.]]></string>

<string id="517885"><![CDATA[My manners? There are different manners of life and thought, none of them mine.

I'm in a special position here, and so I have the right to be blunt sometimes.]]></string>

I am at my deathbed. Before I die, I need to speak to you with regard to your future, and to pass to you whatever meagre property I have.

I must warn you that I had to participate in some mysterious and, as my experience suggests, unfortunate events.
I took an enormous reponsibility upon myself. I am no longer my own master.
Therefore, if you choose to reject my inheritance with what obligations it entails—I will understand your choice and will not begrudge you that.
I don't have much time left. Please make haste. I want to see you one last time.

What a pity I did not spend more time with you while I still could.

Your loving father,
Isidor Burakh

P.S. If you don't make it while I am still alive, go straight to Vlad Olgimsky. He will accommodate you and inform you of my latest affairs in as much detail as he is able to.]]></string>

<string id="518294"><![CDATA[They are naïve. In towns like this reputation is everything. Books are judged by their covers here—even after the last page is turned... No one is going to examine you in detail. A minor rumour here, a gossip there—and you're a public enemy already. You've got zero reputation.

<string id="518300"><![CDATA[The decrease of your reputation depends first and foremost on the number of living beings you've made less than living.

<string id="518764"><![CDATA[The bacteria die or become unreasonably weakened as soon as they're extracted from their nutrient medium; we need to find a way to capture the disease at an active stage.

<string id="518839"><![CDATA[Yet you are going to help me.]]></string>
<string id="518840"><![CDATA[No, Burakh. I'm no fool. I can see the Bachelor standing behind your back. It is he who needs the panacea, not you. He wants to offer it to the Powers That Be along with someone's head—that is the price of his victory. You should find your own path.]]></string>

<string id="518857"><![CDATA[Obey me? Why?]]></string>

<string id="518860"><![CDATA[Are you joking, Burakh? A dancer knows the lines. Only a dancer can bend and extend them—it's a sacred art. These days we're not dancing because of the mourning... But when happier days come, you will see how far we can extend the lines of body.]]></string>
<string id="518861"><![CDATA[I hope happier days come very soon.]]></string>

<string id="518863"><![CDATA[Why did the crowd kill that girl?]]></string>
<string id="518864"><![CDATA[She emerged from an infected house—the one that was later visited by torchmen, you know the one. They say your father, old Isidor, used to work there. So they asked her what business she had there. She said she had brought your father a word and a deed. Everyone expected her to die very quickly, but she didn't.]]></string>
<string id="518865"><![CDATA[I'm asking because I'm very much surprised that you do not get sick.]]></string>
<string id="518866"><![CDATA[Oh, but we do! You can't imagine how many of us died during the First Outbreak! And butchers too... That was a few years ago. It's just that we have more options. The disease leaves us quickly if we're not seriously infected. If we are, however, then we die...]]></string>
<string id="518867"><![CDATA[Shouldn't they have been happy…?]]></string>
<string id="518868"><![CDATA[Why do you think it works like that?]]></string>
<string id="518869"><![CDATA[...Then the townsfolk decided she was to blame for everything. Called her a carrier. And then the rumour spread of a shabnack-adyr coming from below the ground, and so they broke her lines and burnt her at the Bone Stake. But it was a wrong thing to do. Even if she was sick, she couldn't infect anyone else.]]></string>

<string id="518871"><![CDATA[Do you know what Brides are? The Brides who are engaged to the Earth; the Brides who summon twyre.]]></string>
<string id="518872"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="518873"><![CDATA[Yes, I do.]]></string>
<string id="518874"><![CDATA[They are no Mistresses, of course... Compared to a Mistress, even a young one, they're merely candles next to a bonfire. They do have powers, however, and impressive powers at that. Brides say that their—that our juices flow in such a fashion that we can do no harm. Our bodies are clean.]]></string>
<string id="518875"><![CDATA[What do you mean by that?]]></string>
<string id="518876"><![CDATA[If there's not too much Sand Dirt in our bodies, it leaves them quickly. And we can't infect anyone at all, that much is certain. If the Dirt is abundant, however, then it devours us just like any other person, and there's nothing to be done about that.]]></string>
<string id="518877"><![CDATA[I see. Would you like to come with me?]]></string>
<string id="518878"><![CDATA[I'd like to…! But I can't. I have to stay here until the evening—and I do have plans for that time. A handsome guest in a snakeskin coat has arranged to meet me in the Blind Backyard.]]></string>
<string id="518879"><![CDATA[Is that so... I think I know who the happy man is.]]></string>
<string id="518880"><![CDATA[Seems like you are blessed with a great metabolism—who could have thought metabolism is a thing that can depend on the social status. See you later.]]></string>
<string id="518881"><![CDATA[Too bad.]]></string>
<string id="518882"><![CDATA[Don't worry about him. We really are harmless. As a Burakh, you ought to feel it.]]></string>
<string id="518883"><![CDATA[I do feel it, relax.]]></string>
<string id="518884"><![CDATA[The Blind Backyard, eh…? When exactly?]]></string>
<string id="518885"><![CDATA[Nine o'clock. I'll probably come earlier though, I want to have some me time first.]]></string>
<string id="518887"><![CDATA[It will. I am positive that there are antibodies to be found in the bodies of Steppe people. Unless they have natural immunity, that is—which sounds unlikely.]]></string>
<string id="518888"><![CDATA[Okay. Double-checking time: please tell me what you need precisely.]]></string>
<string id="518889"><![CDATA[Sure. As far as I understand, almost every townsperson here has a trace of Steppe blood in them, but there's also an ethnic layer that's been completely untouched by civilization. I'm talking about that Kin of yours. I'm not sure who exacltly belongs to it—I only know that dancers and butchers do. Try one of them.]]></string>
<string id="518891"><![CDATA[Isn't that the usurer's daughter?]]></string>
<string id="518892"><![CDATA[I don't know.]]></string>

<string id="518896"><![CDATA[She's not the quiet type, that's for sure.]]></string>

<string id="518898"><![CDATA[All right then...]]></string>
<string id="518899"><![CDATA[...Then do it. The vaccine is more important than a single life. But I'm seriously asking you to try every other option before you go through with this.]]></string>

<string id="518901"><![CDATA[So a profitable deal of yours have fallen through, I gather?]]></string>
<string id="518902"><![CDATA[That's not the point. The town has lost a usurer and acquired a disruptive gang leader—Grief and Barley pale in comparison to this. I wonder where all his madmen came from... Must be his debtors.]]></string>
<string id="518903"><![CDATA[I don't understand.]]></string>
<string id="518904"><![CDATA[They want to burn the town down. We'll have to deal with a firestarter gang from now on. I have a really bad feeling about this…]]></string>

<string id="518952"><![CDATA[And they're planning to mug the muggers, right?]]></string>
<string id="518953"><![CDATA[Hello there! Living under a rock or what? The angry guys that split off from Grief's gang to cut people on the streets. "We ain't listenin' to ya no more," they said, "the Kin's gone, the old life's blasted, so we ain't got nothin' to lose!" Big words, huh? And so they went slashing and robbing everyone. Those sons of bitches...]]></string>
<string id="518954"><![CDATA[And so your friends are planning to attack them?]]></string>
<string id="518955"><![CDATA[They ain't no friends of mine! Arrogant bastards, stinky turncoats... Ooh, I hate them... What did I do to them?]]></string>
<string id="518956"><![CDATA[That's not an answer.]]></string>
<string id="518957"><![CDATA[Big deal… Don't be silly, just take care of yourself. It'll be all right.]]></string>
<string id="518958"><![CDATA[Well yeah, they are. As if they'd have a shot at it. They planned on arming up—got them weapons stored at a certain place... Well, I'm gonna ruin their party!

<string id="518959"><![CDATA[Why not. Where is the place?]]></string>

<string id="518965"><![CDATA[I will accept it if you tell me the truth.]]></string>
<string id="518966"><![CDATA[I wonder why.]]></string>
<string id="518967"><![CDATA[You are being hunted? I didn't know that.]]></string>
<string id="518968"><![CDATA[I'm forced into hiding, as you can see. The only reason I've come here is because the barbers have wounded a person that I owe a debt. I'm an outlaw on the run now. And I deserve it way more than you…]]></string>
<string id="518969"><![CDATA[What have you done?]]></string>
<string id="518970"><![CDATA[Most likely—considering your recent attitude.]]></string>
<string id="518971"><![CDATA[That's no laughing matter. I have wronged you.]]></string>
<string id="518972"><![CDATA[There was no doubt in my mind that it was you who had killed the Master, until recently. He was obviously killed for the inheritance. It was connected to the Kin admitting the spiritual leadership rights of the Burakhs for the second time. And there is other evidence that... fit together to support the assumption.]]></string>
<string id="518973"><![CDATA[What evidence?]]></string>
<string id="518974"><![CDATA[Firstly, the wound. The thing they're calling a shabnak's claw had inflicted too precise a wound. A wound following every rule of the "secret line", as though the criminal had an intimate knowledge of the inner ways. No butcher could make a blow like that. Secondly, the news of your arrival...]]></string>
<string id="518975"><![CDATA[It's all gotten so confusing. I've been told a strange story not so long ago. I think you are being hunted for something that I had done. For Simon Kain.]]></string>
<string id="518976"><![CDATA[Who told you I was to come shortly?]]></string>
<string id="518977"><![CDATA[Katerina Saburova. Alexander is the governor now. Beware of him.]]></string>
<string id="518978"><![CDATA[What did Katerina Saburova say about me?]]></string>
<string id="518979"><![CDATA[Am I being hunted on his order?]]></string>
<string id="518980"><![CDATA[No. The order is Georgiy Kain's. And he is even more dangerous than Alexander.]]></string>
<string id="518981"><![CDATA[What have I done to upset him?]]></string>
<string id="518982"><![CDATA[The reason being…?]]></string>
<string id="518984"><![CDATA[She said you were coming. Said you would spend your first days here in secrecy. That you are to make a bloody sacrifice.]]></string>
<string id="518985"><![CDATA[Not much then. Did you believe her?]]></string>
<string id="518986"><![CDATA[Of course I did. How could I not? She even said that you will "drown the town in blood", "quench the earth's thirst for blood", or "start a bloodshed". That is literally what she said.]]></string>
<string id="518987"><![CDATA[That could have been said as a metaphor.]]></string>
<string id="518988"><![CDATA[Yes... Those guys that have been working around this place have shed more blood in one day than one could imagine!]]></string>
<string id="518989"><![CDATA[Well, I'll speak to her.]]></string>
<string id="518993"><![CDATA[I don't understand.]]></string>
<string id="518994"><![CDATA[Yes, I've heard that Simon has beed killed.]]></string>
<string id="518995"><![CDATA[You've been attacked, remember? At the Station. They were there on their own accord, I've learned. Tried to ambush Simon's murderer. Thought he would try to escape by hiding in a carriage when a scheduled train arrives.]]></string>
<string id="518996"><![CDATA[What does that have to do with us? I thought oynon Dankovsky had established the truth. Simon's killer is still among us. And we can't punish them yet.]]></string>
<string id="518997"><![CDATA[And so we are hunted by fanatics for desecrating Simon's remains. Well, unlike you, I deserve it. When I realized the nature of his superhuman blood, I had a desperate decision to make. And I've decided to make Sand Plague medicine from Simon's remains.]]></string>
<string id="518998"><![CDATA[Why didn't you explain yourself? Your choice would've been accepted.]]></string>
<string id="518999"><![CDATA[Like hell it would! Explaining myself to the Kains is pointless. They've fetishized Simon! They'd rather place their bets on his sacred power, or the power of his name, or hell knows what else. They are a family of high-handed esoterics who only believe in dark arts!]]></string>
<string id="519000"><![CDATA[Have you looked for antibodies in his blood?]]></string>
<string id="519001"><![CDATA["Fetishized"? What does that mean?]]></string>
<string id="519002"><![CDATA[Where have you been all these years? I thought you were studying.]]></string>
<string id="519003"><![CDATA[I'm kidding. Just didn't expect a word like this to escape your lips. Go on.]]></string>
<string id="519004"><![CDATA[That was the first thing I did. There was nothing of the sort. I am a sceptic, you know. Yet each time I come across the Kains' mysticism, I am filled with fear. It's like the disease began to wither away within him, all on its own... but it didn't die.]]></string>
<string id="519005"><![CDATA[So what are you planning to do to him?]]></string>
<string id="519006"><![CDATA[I'm not planning. The deed's been already done. The sacrilege is complete. I've cut his body open by every line, and squeezed everything I could from it. I pulled the bacteria from it and have made a few protective vaccine samples already. Old Simon has fed mankind with himself once again.]]></string>
<string id="519007"><![CDATA[Can I count on you?]]></string>
<string id="519008"><![CDATA[That depends on what you're planning to do.]]></string>
<string id="519009"><![CDATA["All on its own"? What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="519010"><![CDATA[His blood is of a completely different nature to anything I've seen before. It isn't quite human. More than human, I'd say... In any case, the blood is gone. I used every drop to make the vaccines. I don't regret it though; it wouldn't have helped you anyway, I think.]]></string>
<string id="519011"><![CDATA[Okay. Thank you for the news.]]></string>
<string id="519012"><![CDATA[I'm sorry I can't be of more use. And don't harbour ill feelings against me, please.]]></string>

<string id="519014"><![CDATA[Are you telling the truth? Look me in the eye.]]></string>

<string id="519016"><![CDATA[I haven't killed a single person, I promise.]]></string>
<string id="519017"><![CDATA[...Not only are you a murderer, but also a liar! The former is horrible, but the latter is despicable. I don't want to speak to you, go away.]]></string>
<string id="519018"><![CDATA[You idiot.]]></string>
<string id="519019"><![CDATA[Can't we be friends at all?]]></string>
<string id="519020"><![CDATA[Well... We all do bad things, so we must right our wrongs with the good deeds. The worse the original deed, the more good we must do.]]></string>

<string id="519027"><![CDATA[Painkillers aren't that easy to find. I have better uses for them.]]></string>
<string id="519028"><![CDATA[So you've softened your heart, haven't you?]]></string>
<string id="519029"><![CDATA[I shouldn't have thought so badly of you. If only you knew how horrible the rumours surrounding you are, you wouldn't be so harsh on me…]]></string>
<string id="519030"><![CDATA[What rumours?]]></string>
<string id="519031"><![CDATA[I'm not being harsh on you at all.]]></string>
<string id="519032"><![CDATA[They say you cut human bodies to express yourself.]]></string>
<string id="519033"><![CDATA[Many people do just that. Those who can't muster up the courage to cut others resort to cutting themselves. That's barbaric.]]></string>
<string id="519034"><![CDATA[They say a body is like a tight knot for you—a knot you're longing to untie. That you see knots instead of people around you when walking along the street!]]></string>
<string id="519035"><![CDATA[That's not true.]]></string>
<string id="519036"><![CDATA[What's the point of untying them without need? Knots are only untied when you need loose rope to connect the disjointed.]]></string>
<string id="519037"><![CDATA[They say you make human sacrifices, but refuse to believe in heathen gods.]]></string>
<string id="519038"><![CDATA[The inexplicable is always frightening. I'm surprised you're not scared by the people that kill out of greed or anger.]]></string>
<string id="519039"><![CDATA[That doesn't mean every single knot is supposed to be untied.]]></string>
<string id="519040"><![CDATA[I wish I'd catch the person spreading the rumours. They'll make a perfect sacrifice for some worthless deity. I'd do it by the rite, too!]]></string>
<string id="519041"><![CDATA[It is your good luck that I know where he is. But what do you need him for? You want to take vengeance on him?]]></string>
<string id="519042"><![CDATA[What for?]]></string>
<string id="519043"><![CDATA[He threatened to punish you. He believes that it was you who killed Isidor. He's… he's wrong though, isn't he?]]></string>
<string id="519044"><![CDATA[Of course he is.]]></string>
<string id="519045"><![CDATA[So why do you need him?]]></string>
<string id="519046"><![CDATA[And what do you think?]]></string>
<string id="519047"><![CDATA[Oh, I don't know what to believe!]]></string>
<string id="519048"><![CDATA[Whatever the case, Rubin is a man that can stand up for himself. So where is he?]]></string>
<string id="519049"><![CDATA[I'm making a panacea—and so does he. I want to know if he's had any luck.]]></string>
<string id="519050"><![CDATA[I want to talk to him. About my father's death, for one.]]></string>
<string id="519051"><![CDATA[Your face is terrifying… No, I can't tell you. I don't think you're up to any good.]]></string>
<string id="519052"><![CDATA[Whatever, I'll find him without your help.]]></string>
<string id="519053"><![CDATA[Fine, Lara. I'm making a remedy that helps with the Sand Plague. I need his advice.]]></string>
<string id="519054"><![CDATA[Can you promise me that you'll never reveal his hideout to anyone? Can you swear on your father's memory?]]></string>
<string id="519055"><![CDATA[I can.]]></string>
<string id="519056"><![CDATA[No. I won't swear on my father's memory.]]></string>
<string id="519057"><![CDATA[Your fear speaks for itself. I won't reveal to you where he is.]]></string>
<string id="519058"><![CDATA[As you wish.]]></string>
<string id="519059"><![CDATA[I do. I'm tired of his moronic spite.]]></string>
<string id="519060"><![CDATA[There was a curious sample by his microscope. I've taken a look, but I'm not sure what I saw.]]></string>
<string id="519066"><![CDATA[So who can this be?]]></string>
<string id="519067"><![CDATA[Rubin is the only person who can answer that question, I'm afraid. We should hurry and find him before his persecutors do. I would even be willing to break my word for that. But you said he's not in his prosectorium, right?]]></string>
<string id="519068"><![CDATA[No, he is not.]]></string>
<string id="519069"><![CDATA[Perhaps he is back by now.]]></string>
<string id="519070"><![CDATA[I think Yulia and Lara keep in touch with him... or rather he keeps in touch with them. Perhaps they know something. Try to get to Lara while I'm analyzing this sample.]]></string>
<string id="519071"><![CDATA[You are one stubborn oynon.]]></string>
<string id="519072"><![CDATA[Don't forget to get a sample from him.]]></string>
<string id="519073"><![CDATA[Do you have a plan?]]></string>
<string id="519074"><![CDATA[Master Rubin, who doesn't trust me and is concealing something important, has an unusual source of infected tissue. He's using it to conduct his first experiments. It is not a vaccine, of course, but it's something. I think it might be of interest to you as well.]]></string>
<string id="519075"><![CDATA[You have my attention.]]></string>
<string id="519076"><![CDATA[Seems like Rubin is working with a mysterious carrier of the disease that has weakened microbial culture in their blood. I doubt we could make a vaccine from it—your reagents seem to deal with it all too mercilessly. I wonder what had weakened the infection though…]]></string>
<string id="519077"><![CDATA[Disaster is a big word.]]></string>
<string id="519078"><![CDATA[An appropriate one. I couldn't extract living bacteria, and this little... muck that it leaves behind in dead bodies is of no use... Not to mention that there are no antibodies. But I'm not losing hope.]]></string>
<string id="519079"><![CDATA[Why not?]]></string>
<string id="519080"><![CDATA[What's your vaccine-making process?]]></string>
<string id="519081"><![CDATA[Oh, this out-of-the-way hole—pardon me once again for saying so—knows only one process. The microbial culture is treated with natural agents so that it adapts... Well, Rubin treats it, I test the results. You know all this though, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="519082"><![CDATA[Why is obtaining living bacteria so important?]]></string>
<string id="519083"><![CDATA[Because the purpose of a vaccine is to give the organism a chance to develop immunity. To teach it how to fight the infection. It's obvious! I wonder how a strong and healthy organism would react to these... bacterial experiments?]]></string>
<string id="519084"><![CDATA[Yeah, it won't fight. It'll probably just reject the sample.]]></string>
<string id="519085"><![CDATA[I know how vaccines work, I'm not an idiot. I just wanted to double-check if you're positive there are no antibodies in dead tissue.]]></string>
<string id="519086"><![CDATA[I know all this better than you do. See you later.]]></string>
<string id="519087"><![CDATA[You and Rubin are working on a vaccine. What does it have to do with me? I'm not trying to extract the bacteria.]]></string>
<string id="519088"><![CDATA[Most certainly. But we ought to look further.]]></string>
<string id="519089"><![CDATA[Where?]]></string>
<string id="519090"><![CDATA[You need the antibodies though, don't you? Just listen to me before you refuse my advice.]]></string>
<string id="519091"><![CDATA[I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="519092"><![CDATA[Who is the carrier?]]></string>
<string id="519093"><![CDATA[Beats me. Rubin is keeping tantalizingly mum about the whole business. You're closer to him than I am, though; perhaps he'd be willing to share with you the information that he is concealing from me.]]></string>
<string id="519094"><![CDATA[Rubin hates me.]]></string>
<string id="519095"><![CDATA[He absolutely doesn't. Last time we talked, I described your feats in detail and proved that his suspicions were completely baseless. You're his hero now, and he's deeply ashamed of his tantrum.]]></string>
<string id="519096"><![CDATA[Where do I find him?]]></string>
<string id="519097"><![CDATA[That is something I cannot tell you. I gave my word.]]></string>
<string id="519098"><![CDATA[What? This makes no sense.]]></string>
<string id="519099"><![CDATA[This shadowy scheming and double-dealing is absurd. I have no need for cardboard excuses. Have a nice day.]]></string>
<string id="519100"><![CDATA[Telling me would be in your best interests though, wouldn't it?]]></string>
<string id="519101"><![CDATA[Sating your curiosity is not in my best interests, no. Rubin shares his findings with me—and for me that's enough. Even if the microbes turn out to have come from his own saliva, I don't care. You are the one who does.]]></string>
<string id="519102"><![CDATA[Rubin's trust is very precious to me—and it's so very fragile. If he finds out that it was I who told you where his lair is—a lair that's being actively sought after by numerous armed robbers, I must add—I will lose a very important ally. No way. You're free to look for Rubin yourself.]]></string>
<string id="519103"><![CDATA[I won't ever abuse this knowledge. I can give you my word.]]></string>
<string id="519104"><![CDATA[Okay. How did you manage to find him?]]></string>
<string id="519105"><![CDATA[And where do I start?]]></string>
<string id="519106"><![CDATA[I was introduced to him by a lovely lady called Lara Ravel. She is a very kind, gentle creature. I suppose it would be very hard to be accepted as her guest without a stellar reputation, but you'll probably fight your way in somehow.]]></string>
<string id="519107"><![CDATA[I see where you're going with this. It's this thing people call a "joke", right?]]></string>

<string id="519150"><![CDATA[Ammo is rare. It can be found here and there... Always in small quantities. We've ordered our girls to go out looking for it. You could ask them! They will probably trade ammo and cartriges for their girly treasures...]]></string>

<string id="519155"><![CDATA[Obviously.]]></string>
<string id="519156"><![CDATA[I think it will do better in my hands than in yours.]]></string>
<string id="519157"><![CDATA[Maybe I am. Want to help out?]]></string>
<string id="519158"><![CDATA[That depends on what you're up to.]]></string>
<string id="519159"><![CDATA[I'm up to a good thing. My Soul-and-a-Halves are sneaking about everywhere—watching out for enemy Dogheads, catching Halves, and just generally messing around. So I want to use them for the greater good. Even Sticky will turn green with envy.]]></string>
<string id="519160"><![CDATA[What kind of greater good?]]></string>
<string id="519161"><![CDATA[Who is Sticky?]]></string>
<string id="519162"><![CDATA[Just a bloke. Thinks he's the sharpest. Likes to stick his nose everywhere, won't miss anything fun for the life of him. The more dangerous, the better. Quite above himself too... Wouldn't join our gang... Eh, why are we even talking about him!]]></string>
<string id="519163"><![CDATA[What do you want to talk about then?]]></string>
<string id="519164"><![CDATA[We will scout out which houses have been infected. We'll make a map of them every day. Imagine that! If it goes well, the Bachelor himself will happily trade his right arm for such a map!]]></string>
<string id="519165"><![CDATA[Interesting. Will you show me?]]></string>
<string id="519166"><![CDATA[We can even make a copy for you if you want. Can you do us a favour in return?]]></string>
<string id="519167"><![CDATA[How many?]]></string>
<string id="519168"><![CDATA[Give us ten protective mixtures, and the map is yours. And don't you think I'm being greedy—I just need the infusions to equip the scouts with.]]></string>
<string id="519169"><![CDATA[I agree. We have a deal.]]></string>
<string id="519170"><![CDATA[No. It's a hard task that would take too much time.]]></string>
<string id="519171"><![CDATA[Hardly. Unless someone lends you a hand…]]></string>
<string id="519174"><![CDATA[What kind of favour?]]></string>
<string id="519175"><![CDATA[Your father knew some awesome rare recipes for twyrine infusions. He wrote down the ones that protected from the Sand Plague after the First Outbreak. Can you make them?]]></string>
<string id="519177"><![CDATA[He landed himself in a soup with some bandits.]]></string>
<string id="519178"><![CDATA[Is that because of the Halves? I must have heard about it! Grief demanded they get rid of their wardogs! Were they defending their cubs?]]></string>

<string id="519180"><![CDATA[Well done, Notkin! Don't you think he would pick a quarrel over nothing…]]></string>
<string id="519181"><![CDATA[How did he manage to settle so close to a bandits' den anyway?]]></string>
<string id="519182"><![CDATA[He had a quarrel... with another boy. Khan. Khan is a brave boy as well, and very high-handed, too. They used to be best friends. Now Khan lives in the Polyhedron and the proud Notkin struggles among bandits in a small hut at the Warehouses... It's a long story. How can I thank you?]]></string>
<string id="519184"><![CDATA[I don't need anything. Helping you makes me happy already.]]></string>

<string id="519192"><![CDATA[It's by the southern Warehouses. That is where the Soul-and-a-Halves—that's what they're calling themselves—live. He is not an urchin, he is just... independent and parentless. And he is getting out of hand. Maybe you could go and check on him? What if he is indeed in danger?]]></string>
<string id="519193"><![CDATA[A "pit"? What's that?]]></string>
<string id="519194"><![CDATA[Well... That is what Maria and I call our visions. She calls hers a "flight", I call mine a "pit". That's peculiar because mine are usually joyful, while hers are grim. Or maybe it's just me. So will you check on Notkin?]]></string>

<string id="519202"><![CDATA[What does it mean?]]></string>
<string id="519203"><![CDATA[What it means is our thieves' talk, and you ain't got nothin' to do with it. So stop bein' smart and go. They'll do what you tell 'em to.]]></string>

<string id="519205"><![CDATA[Whaddya think I am, some kind of kid-killin' monster? Even though the lil' punks re nasty, so so nasty... No. I only ordered for the rabid dogs to be taken away from 'em. They're getting' out of hand.]]></string>

<string id="519208"><![CDATA[Or perhaps not, Grief? How about ordering your thieves to leave? The times are tough, you know, it's no child's play... Rats are more dangerous than dogs these days.]]></string>

<string id="519215"><![CDATA[Most honoured master Burakh! Or rather oynon Burakh. You will be called that soon... for you are the keeper of knowledge. A warden, a menkhu... a surgeon, so to say. And even more than that. So, have you looked into the matter of your inheritance?]]></string>
<string id="519216"><![CDATA[I have. Nothing is more important for me right now.]]></string>
<string id="519217"><![CDATA[My daughter told me about these... doomed children that the deceased used to... take care of. I see no point in hiding the truth from you. The brand this... mysterious subject is marked with belongs to the secret steppe code. Can you read Longmark? The so-called "circles or copious brands"?]]></string>
<string id="519218"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="519219"><![CDATA[You've been away for a while... Pray forgive me... Yes, you were but a child when you left... Longmark is a kind of alphabet. The signs that the bulls were branded with. Each of them has many meanings. Each sign is a song. A magical story told in lines. A spell.]]></string>
<string id="519220"><![CDATA[Yes, I see what you mean.]]></string>
<string id="519221"><![CDATA[I don't know this secret code. The Kin does. Maybe some of the odongh Worms or the butchers... And I have to admit, it is me who stands between you and these secrets. I've locked up all inhabitants of the Termitary.]]></string>

<string id="519225"><![CDATA[Most respected Bachelor Dankovskiy... has already harassed me with these pointless questions. If the disease is already inside, then there's all the more reason to keep the doors shut. But enough about that. I want to help you. You want to know the meaning of the brand, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="519226"><![CDATA[I do.]]></string>
<string id="519227"><![CDATA[A few butchers managed to escape the Termitary before it was blocked off. I propose a deal. I've explained to you how you may find them helpful, so you will be looking for them anyway. After you find them, tell me where they are. If you promise to do so, I'll tell you where to start.]]></string>

<string id="519229"><![CDATA[I am no snitch.]]></string>
<string id="519230"><![CDATA[I'm not going to kill them. I must keep an eye on them, however. Don't you realize? Can't you see what's going on? Any possible carrier of the disease has to be isolated! Moreover, mind your obligation...]]></string>

<string id="519232"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="519233"><![CDATA[There is a shack... I've tried sending people over there already, they were greeted coldly. A certain lady lives in it... She is always in the loop; she knows the butchers' ways and what they're after. They say she was begotten by an odongh and a twyre bride... Start off there. She will treat you with respect.]]></string>
<string id="519234"><![CDATA[How come?]]></string>
<string id="519235"><![CDATA[Well... You're Isidor Burakh's son. The eldest Burakh now. It means a lot to them that you are from a menkhu family. Menkhu aren't just surgeons or butchers; they are healers. An almost sacred role... a spiritual one, so to say. All in all, the lady will honor your request and tell you about the runaways.]]></string>
<string id="519236"><![CDATA[Well... if that is enough, I'm going. Show me the place.]]></string>
<string id="519237"><![CDATA[A bride?]]></string>
<string id="519238"><![CDATA[The gatherers... They've got these virgins, these so-called "twyre brides". They claim to chase the herbs from below the ground and onto the surface. You're supposed to know this, aren't you? In any case, they do know you. They acted as midwives when you were born…]]></string>

<string id="519240"><![CDATA[I can deal with my inheritance myself.]]></string>
<string id="519241"><![CDATA[An ill-judged reply. Or maybe you do know the meaning of the brand you've found inside the stash?]]></string>

<string id="519244"><![CDATA[You mean the hieroglyphic alphabet?]]></string>

<string id="519251"><![CDATA[Yes. The current one, Oyun.]]></string>
<string id="519252"><![CDATA[Why so anxious all of a sudden?]]></string>
<string id="519253"><![CDATA[Have the Mistresses told you about him? Yeah, I've lost one friend called Burakh already, and Foreman Oyun knows why... yes. He will pay for it... Anyway, I don't want to lose another.]]></string>
<string id="519254"><![CDATA[He knows who killed my father?]]></string>
<string id="519255"><![CDATA[Does he... He knows all right. Allow me to say I'm pretty sure he's not unhappy about your father's death... Oyun, that is. He wouldn't be unhappy if you were to die either. No, there's no reason for you to meet him right now.]]></string>
<string id="519256"><![CDATA[What do the Mistresses have to do with it? It's just rumours.]]></string>

<string id="519262"><![CDATA[I haven't spoken to him yet. We'll have some extreme interrogation when he's back.]]></string>
<string id="519263"><![CDATA[He went off to the Steppe. He's not in town at the moment. I think he's supposed to come back in a day or two.]]></string>

<string id="519265"><![CDATA[When did he leave?]]></string>
<string id="519266"><![CDATA[Three days ago. Or maybe four. Exactly on the eve of your arrival, master Burakh.]]></string>

<string id="519268"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="519269"><![CDATA[The're a plot being woven against me. The Bachelor is nosing about the Termitary and the Abattoir... If I meet the Foreman, I'll give him another reason to suspect me...

<string id="519276"><![CDATA[I can imagine. You're looking for the runaway. Oh, it's such a shame that Fat Vlad managed to weasel his way into your circle of friends! That friendship will do you no good, oh no... But you're too late anyway. An outsider fop, a bachelor in a snakeskin coat, came by poking his nose everywhere. I've lead the runaway butchers into the Steppe. Otherwise he'd have shot them all dead.]]></string>

<string id="519278"><![CDATA[Does he have firearms?]]></string>

<string id="519280"><![CDATA[Some are still hiding throughout the town. I'm planning to collect them one by one—I've found one already, and it won't take me too long to find the rest.

<string id="519288"><![CDATA[Ok, I'll tell you. His hideout is the place that anyone with two legs runs away from today. Look for him there. But be careful. He is being hunted. Don't let the hunters catch you two—because they won't waste their time trying to get to know you.]]></string>

<string id="519298"><![CDATA[Patrolmen came. Killed two of my brothers. Now they're after the third one. I've hidden here. The body that I opened up was taken away to be buried.

<string id="519311"><![CDATA[Are you talking about gods?]]></string>

<string id="519313"><![CDATA[What else can you tell me about this sign?]]></string>
<string id="519314"><![CDATA[If something is marked with this sign, then it is neither a man, nor a child of Boddho, nor of Suok. It's a Supreme. What you need is not a man, oynon. Your father had something to do with Those Who Walk the Corridor. It scares me. The brand is drawn there for a reason. They are not men. This is all I know.]]></string>

<string id="519339"><![CDATA[I hope I manage to make what I want out of it. Meanwhile, how can I return your kindness? I have no money, but I can offer you something better—the drugs that are not available to the general public yet.

<string id="519346"><![CDATA[Rubin doesn't speak to me, oynon. Seems like he still believes that I'm guilty of patricide.]]></string>
<string id="519347"><![CDATA[I can remedy that.]]></string>
<string id="519348"><![CDATA[I would be very grateful. Good luck with the tissue.]]></string>
<string id="519349"><![CDATA[Yes. You're talking about menkhu—they're butchers and wardens. That is their right. But it's not about morals.]]></string>
<string id="519350"><![CDATA[Exactly. I need tissues of a person who died of the Sand Plague. I need them today, right now! I've tried to get them at the cemetery, but failed miserably. The patrolmen are vigilantly watching over the dead.]]></string>
<string id="519351"><![CDATA[I'd reward you generously for that.]]></string>

<string id="519362"><![CDATA[What are you talking about? The serum?]]></string>
<string id="519363"><![CDATA[Yes. Tell me how to extract antibodies from tissue.]]></string>
<string id="519364"><![CDATA[First of all, they have to be there. If you're sure they are, then there are several general ways to go from there. A serum, after all, is just a blood component. As far as I understand, you can mix a sample of it with those… natural agents. We'll need to get a sample first though. Then go ahead. Experiment.]]></string>
<string id="519365"><![CDATA[Right. An experiment like this has been successful once before.]]></string>
<string id="519366"><![CDATA[So I've heard. Your father was a natural. So what did you want to ask of me? ]]></string>
<string id="519367"><![CDATA[When you get down to studying a tissue sample, please see if there are antibodies in it.]]></string>
<string id="519368"><![CDATA[I have no intention to hide my results from you, obviously. But, regrettably, I have serious doubts that they are going to make you happy; it doesn't look like human organisms can resist the disease at all. At least that's what I've been seeing so far, sadly…]]></string>
<string id="519369"><![CDATA[Yet my father's endeavours were a success.]]></string>
<string id="519370"><![CDATA[That's all I'm hoping for. Don't worry, I'll tell you of my findings. The first results will become available as soon as tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="519371"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="519372"><![CDATA[I know you are a killer. One of the worst killers anyone in this town has ever seen, in fact. You are charged with premediated murder of at least four people. The death of Simon Kain and your father are being looked into.]]></string>
<string id="519373"><![CDATA[You have no proof.]]></string>
<string id="519374"><![CDATA[But I will, damn it! If it weren't for Simon's death... And the sudden threat of an epidemic... If only they let me off the leash! Perhaps tonight I will finally get rid of it though. Your patron, Olgimsky, won't be able to veto my decisions then!]]></string>

<string id="519390"><![CDATA[That's better than nothing.]]></string>
<string id="519391"><![CDATA[It is only out of respect for the Bachelor—he is for some reason absolutely sure of your innocence, that's understandable, he's an outsider after all—but it is only out of respect for him that I will hand you the inheritance.

<string id="519400"><![CDATA[So what do the late Mistresses say I will do?]]></string>
<string id="519401"><![CDATA[A living Mistress does. Katerina Saburova, my wife. She knows you will bring us much sorrow in the coming days. You'd be in jail already if not for Olgimsky's protection!]]></string>

<string id="519410"><![CDATA[Why are you so self-assured, architect?]]></string>
<string id="519411"><![CDATA[Because I have the will to kill. It is easy for me to take the life of a living being. Living beings can feel that, and fear paralyzes them before I even strike.]]></string>

<string id="519467"><![CDATA[So you had business with him?]]></string>
<string id="519468"><![CDATA[No way... I couldn't even get near him. He was a wise, well-respected man, your father was. Us children of dirt had no business rubbin' shoulders with a guy like this... It just feels good to have a spiritual beacon walk among us people—keepin' both himself and us in austerity.]]></string>
<string id="519469"><![CDATA[Who could have killed him?]]></string>
<string id="519470"><![CDATA[Nobody's got nothin' to gain from that, I think. There was a tale goin' about though… that your honourable father was plannin' to finally take the proper place—the one that belonged to the guy by the rite and the right… of birth, that is.]]></string>
<string id="519471"><![CDATA[What place?]]></string>
<string id="519472"><![CDATA[The place that ain't pointed at by no charters. But every single whelp in the Kin can see that invisible throne. Foreman Oyun sits it now, all comfy there like a slug on a fruit. Sittin' tight all right, but it looks mighty ugly…]]></string>

<string id="519474"><![CDATA[Planning? What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="519475"><![CDATA[I mean what I say, mate. He has stated his willingness to do just that. Aye, you think nothin' of it. 'Twas not about ambition, 'twas only unavoidable fate.

<string id="519482"><![CDATA[Do you?]]></string>
<string id="519483"><![CDATA[I have already heard that Saburov hates you. Katerina has scared him witless with her prophecies. It seems that he believes you to be more terrible a creature than shabnak-adyr herself. If he gets absolute authority, we will have to hide you. He will demand we turn you in.]]></string>
<string id="519484"><![CDATA[How can he get absolute authority?]]></string>
<string id="519485"><![CDATA[Isn't his authority absolute already?]]></string>
<string id="519486"><![CDATA[Of course not. The town is governed by three families, just like before. The Saburov's position has grown stronger since mom died, however, since Katerina is the only Mistress left. Oh, I wonder how much longer I have to wait…]]></string>
<string id="519487"><![CDATA[What does Saburov want?]]></string>
<string id="519488"><![CDATA[Katerina is a weak Mistress. She can see the future, but I doubt she can change anything. Nor can she grant others strength like mom did... Saburov wants to make up for her weakness with his power. He wants to rule alone and with an iron fist.]]></string>
<string id="519489"><![CDATA[How can he do that?]]></string>
<string id="519490"><![CDATA[He will do so on the pretext of curbing the epidemic. Have you heard what the Bachelor has announced?]]></string>
<string id="519491"><![CDATA[When is this likely to happen?]]></string>
<string id="519492"><![CDATA[It depends... If the Bachelor's suspicions are correct, it could even happen tomorrow. Hopefully it never does.]]></string>
<string id="519493"><![CDATA[Hopefully.]]></string>
<string id="519514"><![CDATA[A Bride. A true Bride now. I was but a girl yesterday. Now I dance with the Earth, sing to the herbs, and lure swevery out in the open with my very whisper.]]></string>
<string id="519515"><![CDATA[Do you gather herbs?]]></string>
<string id="519516"><![CDATA[No. Gatherers gather herbs. I merely live. I caress the Earth, I kiss the Earth, I nourish it with my warmth. Every night I run through the herbs naked and sing lullabies to them. Every night demands a different lullaby. Every herb demands a different lullaby. I know them all. I know how to make herbs lush.]]></string>
<string id="519517"><![CDATA[So you summon herbs from below the ground?]]></string>
<string id="519518"><![CDATA[Not all of them. Some of them.]]></string>
<string id="519519"><![CDATA[Your husband is a lucky man.]]></string>
<string id="519520"><![CDATA[He will be rich, but for that—he is never to touch me. That makes him miserable. Can you see how much I love him? Could it be that this generous summer has been conceived by my love? Herbs are everywhere; the world is a-herb; the odour makes my head spin! Herbs lull the world to sleep; my chosen one is sleeping. But I do not miss him.]]></string>
<string id="519521"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="519522"><![CDATA[My father sold me to another man, he sold me to his odongh, the one that has made camp on the other side of the river. He could have become rich; I could have become well-respected. Perhaps there will be less herbs now. Perhaps none at all.]]></string>
<string id="519523"><![CDATA[That's too bad.]]></string>
<string id="519566"><![CDATA[You may come into your inheritance. No one will dare get in your way. There's no proof of your wrongdoing... You may take the keys from Alexander Saburov. I can't imagine how they got into his hands... but never mind. That's the good news.]]></string>
<string id="519567"><![CDATA[Who is this Alexander?]]></string>
<string id="519568"><![CDATA[Pray see... I'm not the only one to bear the burden of authority in this town. The power is divided among three families: the Olgimskys, the Kains, and the Saburovs. The Saburovs are mostly in charge of… shall I say… the executive power. The enforcement machine, so to speak.]]></string>
<string id="519569"><![CDATA[And the bad news?]]></string>
<string id="519570"><![CDATA[The bad news. I've spoken to Saburov about your... case. And he is, to say the least, furious. It seems that he's set on destroying you by any means possible—disregarding my protection and my personal warranty of good faith.]]></string>
<string id="519571"><![CDATA[What have I done to make him so angry?]]></string>
<string id="519572"><![CDATA[It's not him, I think, but rather his wife. Katerina is a Mistress, a woman of a mystical gift... Her opinion is well-respected... no matter what kind of person she is. And she has had a vision of you bringing some horrific bloodshed to pass. That is the price of your ascension to glory, according to her.]]></string>
<string id="519574"><![CDATA[Is that so? I had no plans for mass bloodshed.]]></string>
<string id="519575"><![CDATA[Everyone has their ups and downs.]]></string>
<string id="519576"><![CDATA[I believe you, I do... But can it really be helped? Alexander trusts his wife more than he'd ever trust me. The Saburovs' duty is to maintain order, and such a discovery about your... mission couldn't make them happy. It seems that Alexander has taken it upon himself to stop you from fulfilling this... ahem... prophecy.]]></string>
<string id="519577"><![CDATA[Is your name enough to hold him back?]]></string>
<string id="519578"><![CDATA[Yes—for a while... But the news of Simon Kain's death, the rumours of some epidemic... they're stirring our small town. The people are scared. Alexander is demanding emergency powers. And if he gets what he's asking for, I won't be able to help you like I do now. The Lump will not protect you then.]]></string>
<string id="519579"><![CDATA[So what do we do?]]></string>
<string id="519580"><![CDATA[We hope for the best. I have arranged for a hideout to be prepared—just in case... You will be able to lay low and continue your work there even if Saburov does get the power... and orders me to turn you in. The place isn't exactly comfortable, but it's reliable. It will become your home.]]></string>
<string id="519581"><![CDATA[Thank you, boös Vlad.]]></string>
<string id="519582"><![CDATA[Not at all... I've done so little for you... The times we live in—the mad and cruel times! But you will come into your father's inheritance. Talk to Alexander... and his wife even. Use the short break and the immunity that you have while you have them...]]></string>

<string id="519755"><![CDATA[I don't understand.]]></string>
<string id="519756"><![CDATA[The men at the station mistook you for the murderer. Problem is, now they're broadcasting your features to anyone who would listen. You do stand out, you know...

<string id="519759"><![CDATA[What am I being accused of?]]></string>
<string id="519760"><![CDATA[First of all, the deaths that you are actually to blame for. It was self-defence, perhaps, but you can't prove that right now... but that's a minor problem anyway. Secondly, the murder of this town's leader, Simon Kain. Now that is more serious... A tangled mess of interests and parties... And thirdly, you've been accused of killing your father, Isidor.]]></string>
<string id="519761"><![CDATA[That's enough.]]></string>
<string id="519762"><![CDATA[The leader's death has stirred the townsfolk up, and the Kains are also willing to take drastic measures now... And you don't want to make those hawks angry...

He's the one searching for the murderer for them.]]></string>
<string id="519769"><![CDATA[So you suggest I meet him?]]></string>
<string id="519770"><![CDATA[He's quite quick on the draw, they say... If only you could find him before he finds you... he won't shoot you straight away then, perhaps. Meanwhile, I'll be doing everything I can to aid you. It would have been so much better if you could just... lay low for a while... But they'll come for you here soon, I'm afraid.]]></string>

It's not like the mob is looking for two separate murderers, really... the patterns feel similar... the circumstances... and by the way, Isidor and Simon had met the day before. What can I say? One thing leads to another… it's not like they've got the time to reflect upon the situation thoughtfully... he-heh... they're in a hurry to catch the bad guy!

<string id="519784"><![CDATA[A well-respected one. Do you remember the Saburovs? I doubt that... Katerina isn't that much older than you. Katerina, Alexander Saburov's wife. She has extraordinary talents... Precognitive, dare I say… No one questions them… That much is certain.]]></string>
<string id="519785"><![CDATA[Did she foresee me coming?]]></string>
<string id="519786"><![CDATA[Not only that... She foresaw many horrors related to you. But it's all very vague. And, you know, compared to my deceased wife, Katerina's talents are... to put it mildly... controversial. But they're enough for the commoners to identify you and…]]></string>
<string id="519787"><![CDATA[So what, am I a suspect for the whole town?]]></string>
<string id="519788"><![CDATA[What? My father has been murdered?]]></string>
<string id="519789"><![CDATA[There is a theory... A weird death... he was ready for it though, wasn't he? He did let you know beforehand... And then he died precisely that night... Well, the fear's greater than the reason for it, you know. Pray tell... Why would anyone examine the evidence now? It's so much easier to just tear apart the troublemaker... you, that is.]]></string>
<string id="519790"><![CDATA[What do I have to do with the murder? I've only just arrived.]]></string>
<string id="519791"><![CDATA[This misfortune is already more than enough.]]></string>
<string id="519792"><![CDATA[We'll fight for the justice then, shall we... master Burakh.]]></string>
<string id="519793"><![CDATA[Do the members of your family also believe I'm innocent?]]></string>
<string id="519794"><![CDATA[Pray forgive me… As firmly as they believe they're innocent themselves.]]></string>
<string id="519795"><![CDATA[Can I speak to them?]]></string>
<string id="519796"><![CDATA[Of course... My daughter lives with me, she is in the next wing. My son, Vladislav Jr., is currently staying in a building on the outskirts of the town... he's got some shady business there... I'll give you the address. Perhaps they'll help you in word and deed.]]></string>
<string id="519797"><![CDATA[I hope so.]]></string>
<string id="519798"><![CDATA[What do you think I should do now?]]></string>
<string id="519802"><![CDATA[Still, I'd rather hide here for the time being.]]></string>
<string id="519803"><![CDATA[Pray forgive me... But this is a poor choice. You're always welcome at the Lump, of course... but that will not work out in your favour... And if they come here to arrest you, you'll have nothing to prove your innocence... and I will have to comply. The choice, however, is yours.]]></string>
<string id="519804"><![CDATA[All right, I'll follow your advice.]]></string>
<string id="519805"><![CDATA[And yet I'll rest here for a while.]]></string>
<string id="519806"><![CDATA[I'll go and talk to your daughter.]]></string>
<string id="519807"><![CDATA[I'm bleeding. Do you have a first-aid kit?]]></string>
<string id="519808"><![CDATA[Ask the servants… those that haven't scattered, that is... the panic... the panic is so devastating... Better yet, go ask my daughter, little Victoria, she's in the other wing of the house. She'll help you…]]></string>
<string id="519809"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>

<string id="519812"><![CDATA[Speak with my father first! He lives next door.]]></string>
<string id="519813"><![CDATA[I wanted to speak with you first.]]></string>
<string id="519814"><![CDATA[Dad said I should send you to him if you get the wrong door and come to me first by mistake. I have to behave.]]></string>
<string id="519815"><![CDATA[Ok.]]></string>
<string id="519816"><![CDATA[All in due time.]]></string>
<string id="519817"><![CDATA[Being slandered is terrible and sad. There is only one way out: doing good and not doing bad anymore.]]></string>
<string id="519818"><![CDATA[How do I do that?]]></string>
<string id="519819"><![CDATA[You know what my mom used to tell me? There's good fortune and bad fortune. When someone is touched by the bad fortune, it jumps on his neck and rides him wherever it pleases, further and further—until he shrugs it off. The further it pushes him, the longer it takes to get back on track.]]></string>
<string id="519820"><![CDATA[That is nothing new.]]></string>
<string id="519821"><![CDATA[Perhaps. But the point is the bad fortune will plant misdeeds on your path so that you commit more and more of them. Even something innocent thrown into your path by the bad fortune can turn into a truly evil deed when you're carrying it on your shoulders!]]></string>
<string id="519822"><![CDATA[So is it on my shoulders already?]]></string>
<string id="519823"><![CDATA[It is! It is unlikely you will manage to do a lot good deeds, but please at least try to stay away from doing bad. I can even tell you where the bad deeds await you today... Do you believe in my precognition?]]></string>
<string id="519824"><![CDATA[I do. Please tell me.]]></string>
<string id="519825"><![CDATA[Danger awaits you at the Cemetery, at the Warehouses, and in the Steppe. I don't know what it is, but chances are you will do a lot of evil there. It would be best for you not to go there today at all... And do not listen to the misguided advice that claims otherwise!]]></string>
<string id="519826"><![CDATA[I'll think about it.]]></string>
<string id="519827"><![CDATA[Many good people have turned away from you, and the bad ones are drawing closer. Lost in the vaccum, you will be tempted to meet their requests. Do not make that mistake!]]></string>
<string id="519828"><![CDATA[I'll try.]]></string>
<string id="519829"><![CDATA[No, I'd rather not know.]]></string>
<string id="519830"><![CDATA[Who can I talk to regardless of my reputation?]]></string>
<string id="519831"><![CDATA[Please heed my words! Khan won't be of any help; however, Sticky is probably hanging around the backstreets, and I haven't heard from Taya for quite a while... Have you by any chance met Grace already, the sweet girl?]]></string>
<string id="519832"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="519833"><![CDATA[She is the gravedigger's daughter. She lives in a small lodge at the cemetery. Do you know where the Cemetery is? It is in Earth, to the southwest of the Abattoir.]]></string>
<string id="519834"><![CDATA[So she believes it wasn't me who killed my father and Simon?]]></string>
<string id="519835"><![CDATA[She is a wonderful, enthralling, unearthly creature! She may seem strange, but I have never met a kinder, more honest, generous, and beautiful soul than her! And don't you ever believe anyone saying that she loves the dead more than the living. She is just so lonely...]]></string>
<string id="519836"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="519837"><![CDATA[Do you know a boy called Notkin?]]></string>
<string id="519838"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="519839"><![CDATA[He is so very brave, and a faithful friend, too! He won't ever care for gossip and slander if he comes to love and respect you. Notkin would always come to your aid and be willing to die by your side even if the whole world was against you. He would never betray a friend!]]></string>
<string id="519840"><![CDATA[I would love to be spoken about like this too.]]></string>
<string id="519841"><![CDATA[Well, he has his ups and downs as well... He is kind to his friends, but he knows no mercy for his foes. And he is overdoing it sometimes. He does have a thirst for blood, just like... well. He'll probably grow up to be a combat general, like Block or Shoin.]]></string>
<string id="519842"><![CDATA["Just like…" me, right? I can see where you're coming from.]]></string>
<string id="519843"><![CDATA[We'll just wait and see.]]></string>
<string id="519844"><![CDATA[I'll get to know him.]]></string>
<string id="519845"><![CDATA[I do.]]></string>
<string id="519846"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="519847"><![CDATA[What about a boy called Notkin then?]]></string>
<string id="519848"><![CDATA[I haven't.]]></string>
<string id="519849"><![CDATA[I've met him too.]]></string>
<string id="519850"><![CDATA[True.]]></string>
<string id="519851"><![CDATA[You are a victim of a terrible mistake. Yet there is something I want to reveal to you; it will help you reestablish your good reputation. I'll give you a few names. All of them belong to children, but don't judge them by their age. Some of them may be of invaluable help to you.]]></string>
<string id="519853"><![CDATA[Do you know why their relationship with your father has grown tighter recently?]]></string>
<string id="519854"><![CDATA[I have no idea.]]></string>
<string id="519855"><![CDATA[The reason is quite sad. These children, my friends and faithful aids, are going to die soon.]]></string>
<string id="519856"><![CDATA[Why? Are they terminally ill?]]></string>
<string id="519857"><![CDATA[No, but you must believe me. Your father has done so without hesitation—and you know that he was a clever and suspicious man. He kept checking if anything was wrong with the kids every day. That is just how their line of fortune goes. They are more likely to die than to live.]]></string>
<string id="519858"><![CDATA[How do you know that?]]></string>
<string id="519859"><![CDATA[Precognition. Not only mine though. All of us agree on this. So does... did your father... and Simon... it's still so hard for me to speak about them in the past tense... and Maria too. Katerina even. Everyone agrees. Please take care of them like your father did. They must live! Simon and Isidor died, so they too must be on the brink!]]></string>
<string id="519860"><![CDATA[What can I do for them?]]></string>
<string id="519861"><![CDATA[Just keep them in mind. And if you ever hold their lines of fortune in your hand, please do not let them go. You are also not a common man, you know. You are your father's son.]]></string>
<string id="519862"><![CDATA[Is that so...]]></string>
<string id="519863"><![CDATA[I'll try, but no promises.]]></string>
<string id="519864"><![CDATA[That will not do. They are your responsibility now.]]></string>
<string id="519865"><![CDATA[Seems like it's no use arguing with you.]]></string>
<string id="519866"><![CDATA[Why do you care?]]></string>
<string id="519867"><![CDATA[I just do. That is how it is supposed to be. I have told you that I feel the coming of a new time. And it will very likely require sacrifice. I don't want to see my friends die.]]></string>
<string id="519868"><![CDATA[Okay. They will live.]]></string>
<string id="519869"><![CDATA[Fortune can't be changed.]]></string>
<string id="519870"><![CDATA[Okay. I'll take care of them.]]></string>
<string id="519871"><![CDATA[Medical matters, I believe. What else could it be?]]></string>
<string id="519875"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="519876"><![CDATA[So Isidor has left you an inheritance. A questionable stroke of luck. He wasn't rich, I believe?]]></string>
<string id="519877"><![CDATA[I'll find a use for the money, no matter the amount.]]></string>
<string id="519878"><![CDATA[I didn't mean the money. Knowing your esteemed father, I dare suggest that there's something else in his inheritance. It is a Burakh's legacy, after all. The family's ritualistic tradition implies mostly something of a less… material nature, doesn't it?]]></string>
<string id="519879"><![CDATA[Probably.]]></string>
<string id="519880"><![CDATA[Speaking of tradition. I've always marvelled at your Burakhs' faithfulness to your duty. It seems to be sacred for all of you. Especially when it has to do with... debts. Oynon—a wise man—would never allow his dead to have outstanding debts.]]></string>
<string id="519881"><![CDATA[Where are you going with this?]]></string>
<string id="519882"><![CDATA[A simple analysis leads me to believe that you'll inherit something else—along with priceless knowledge, unique potions, and material possessions, of course. An obligation. A terrible one.]]></string>
<string id="519883"><![CDATA[What? How do you know?]]></string>
<string id="519884"><![CDATA[A risky obligation. A dangerous one... So, if I were you, I would think twice before accepting that inheritance—even though you're in a dire situation. You may find there's a venomous snake in that precious chest.]]></string>
<string id="519885"><![CDATA[No. I don't believe in avoiding obligations. And I won't ever leave my father beyond life's doorstep burdened with something I'm afraid to take on.]]></string>
<string id="519886"><![CDATA[So I thought... You are truly your father's son. And still... this weight could break your back.]]></string>
<string id="519887"><![CDATA[Do you know something that I don't, master Vlad?]]></string>
<string id="519888"><![CDATA[Only that this burden broke your father's back the day before. I don't believe in this maneater woman. I simply don't. And I've heard that he'd given an oath. An oath he swore on the honour of his family—and that means on your honour as well. That was why he had called upon you... not because he was about to die.]]></string>
<string id="519889"><![CDATA[Do you know that for sure?]]></string>
<string id="519890"><![CDATA[No. These are simply my fragmentary observations—I am quite observant, you know—and the following analysis that allows to wrap it all up into a single logical picture. This is my version of what had happened. I commend your principles and courage, but I also feel sorry for you. Think about it.]]></string>
<string id="519891"><![CDATA[I thank you, but I have made up my mind already.]]></string>
<string id="519892"><![CDATA[I'll think about it.]]></string>
<string id="519893"><![CDATA[Do you mean it? In all sincerity?]]></string>
<string id="519894"><![CDATA[Of course I do. I am the heir to the richest family in the area. I have little to nothing to gain in this matter. It's just sympathy. You came here expecting wealth, but you'll only get… troubles instead.]]></string>
<string id="519895"><![CDATA[Do you know something that I don't, master Vlad?]]></string>
<string id="519896"><![CDATA[What kind of obligation?]]></string>
<string id="519897"><![CDATA[True. If that ever happens, this warden's kin is stripped of their right to possess secret knowledge. A haruspex whose conscience is guilty is no longer a haruspex. That's what I've been told.]]></string>
<string id="519898"><![CDATA[Exactly. You're not an expert on the local traditions though, are you? Even though you come from a native family? You were taken away when you were very young.]]></string>
<string id="519899"><![CDATA[You seem to know more than I do. How come?]]></string>
<string id="519900"><![CDATA[I'm just keen on the local lore.]]></string>
<string id="519901"><![CDATA[I mean my father's personal circumstances. How do you know what his inheritance contains?]]></string>
<string id="519902"><![CDATA[How do you know that?]]></string>
<string id="519903"><![CDATA[It's a very small town. Get used to it—except for those secrets that can cost someone their life, none remain secret for long. Something always seeps through. However, the traditions of the Steppe are kept under lock and key more firmly than others.]]></string>
<string id="519904"><![CDATA[Good to hear.]]></string>
<string id="519905"><![CDATA[Downright poor, I'd say. But it has nothing to do with my luck.]]></string>

<string id="519907"><![CDATA[Where can I find the tools and resources I need?]]></string>
<string id="519908"><![CDATA[So you're not welcome in shops, are you? There is a way out. Try to get to know Bad Grief. Tell him your name, and I'd be damned if he doesn't treat you with utmost respect!]]></string>
<string id="519909"><![CDATA[Who is Bad Grief?]]></string>
<string id="519910"><![CDATA[The king of thieves, a smuggler, a counterfeit twyrine maker. All in all, an exceptionaly graceless specimen. But he does have his own principles... and he can be useful sometimes. Right now he can be useful to you.]]></string>
<string id="519911"><![CDATA[Where is he hiding?]]></string>
<string id="519912"><![CDATA[His lair is at the northern warehouses. You be careful there though, it's the bandits' domain, after all.]]></string>
<string id="519913"><![CDATA[I can hold my own.]]></string>
<string id="519914"><![CDATA[I know him already.]]></string>
<string id="519915"><![CDATA[Then go ahead and trade with him. He's got everything, from cannons to antiques.]]></string>
<string id="519916"><![CDATA[Okay.]]></string>

<string id="519920"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="519921"><![CDATA[I'm but a poor postman, you see… Tasked with delivering a letter of utter importance. Yet I was told he would only be here at eleven.]]></string>
<string id="519922"><![CDATA[Does this letter by any chance refer to one Burakh?]]></string>
<string id="519923"><![CDATA[I haven't read it!]]></string>
<string id="519924"><![CDATA[Yes you have. You're such a lousy liar even a mask can't conceal that.]]></string>
<string id="519925"><![CDATA[Okay, all right... No, the letter refers to one... Bachelor Dankovsky, who has come to the town for personal reasons, but will soon take on the responsibility of dealing with Simon Kain's mysterious murder!]]></string>
<string id="519926"><![CDATA[Thank you, mate.]]></string>
<string id="519927"><![CDATA[Too bad.]]></string>
<string id="519928"><![CDATA[I'll wait next door.]]></string>
<string id="519929"><![CDATA[Do I look like him?]]></string>
<string id="519930"><![CDATA[In all honesty, absolutely not. I just thought you may represent him.]]></string>
<string id="519931"><![CDATA[Tough luck once again.]]></string>
<string id="519932"><![CDATA[What do you want?]]></string>
<string id="519999"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="520000"><![CDATA[Master Burakh! We have prepared a shelter for you.]]></string>
<string id="520001"><![CDATA[Nice to hear that.]]></string>
<string id="520002"><![CDATA[You mustn't think that we're shutting the door on you though. We'll always be happy to accomodate you at our place. My sister and I have persuaded our father that The Lump should become your fortress. But your enemies are powerful. Invisibility will protect you from them.]]></string>
<string id="520003"><![CDATA[What kind of shelter is it?]]></string>
<string id="520004"><![CDATA[It's your father's secret laboratory. The place is modest, but well-hidden from prying eyes. I'm not sure... mmm... what exactly you're planning to do there, but if at least a tenth of Katerina's... mmm... prophecy comes true, then you'll need a secluded hideout.]]></string>
<string id="520005"><![CDATA[That is exactly what I need.]]></string>
<string id="520006"><![CDATA[Moreover, I have spoken to Bachelor Dankovsky. He is taking a lot of interest in your affairs lately, and he seems to care about you personally… He dropped me a hint that you may need your father's potion-brewing apparatus. It is there.]]></string>
<string id="520007"><![CDATA[Is it that same device that my father used?]]></string>
<string id="520008"><![CDATA[Yes. You may remember the extraordinary properties of the herb called twyre. Can you smell the spiciness in the air? It's twyre. Twyre is extremely rare, but using said device a skilled person could... Well, you'll get the hang of it soon enough.]]></string>
<string id="520009"><![CDATA[So that means people do know about this place, doesn't it?]]></string>
<string id="520010"><![CDATA[I cannot say for sure if Isidor used to bring his apprentices and... mmm... strangers over there, of course. But knowing his character, I would assume that he did not. I don't think so—I myself found out about it by coincidence. It's really well-hidden.]]></string>
<string id="520011"><![CDATA[Fine. Please show me where it is.]]></string>
<string id="520012"><![CDATA[Let's hope I don't get ambushed there.]]></string>
<string id="520013"><![CDATA[That fills me with enthusiasm. Farewell.]]></string>
<string id="520015"><![CDATA[No problem. If I ever feel that I'm missing company, I'll find some.]]></string>
<string id="520017"><![CDATA[Am I in need of it already?]]></string>
<string id="520019"><![CDATA[I wholeheartedly wish you luck, master Burakh!]]></string>
<string id="520020"><![CDATA[Where can I obtain twyre?]]></string>
<string id="520021"><![CDATA[You can gather it yourself, of course—thankfully, it's more than plentiful this year. Even the old-timers don't remember anything like this... But it takes time. If the year is bountiful, a professional gatherer can spend a day just to find five or six blades. This year, however, you could gather fifty in the same time!]]></string>
<string id="520022"><![CDATA[That means there are professional gatherers, right?]]></string>
<string id="520023"><![CDATA[Of course. It's an art, people dedicate their lives to it. Oh how they cherish their twyre... They grow it, watch over it, nourish it and give it beautiful names. They whisper it out of the ground, they sing songs to it. And it all works!]]></string>
<string id="520024"><![CDATA[How do I find them?]]></string>
<string id="520025"><![CDATA[There are quite a few huts scattered across the Steppe. The nearest one is in Earth, to the south-west of the Gates of Sorrow. Those are the more oblivious ones... The ones in the Stone Yard and in the Steppe behind the Station are better at hiding. It would be better for you to seek out the ones by the Gates.]]></string>
<string id="520026"><![CDATA[I hope it isn't too far away from the town.]]></string>
<string id="520027"><![CDATA[The gatherer's hut? It's between the Gates and the Cemetery. Just a few steps into the Steppe.]]></string>
<string id="520028"><![CDATA[Then I'll find it easily.]]></string>
<string id="520029"><![CDATA[Okay.]]></string>
<string id="520030"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="520031"><![CDATA[It takes forever… how much longer do I have to wait? It's starting to get dark around seven here, you know?]]></string>

<string id="520049"><![CDATA[Has anyone come round looking for me?]]></string>
<string id="520050"><![CDATA[Oh, yes! There's been this smart alec! A pushy guy, spoke through his teeth... “If I catch this murderer," he said, "I'll squeeze out his blood drop by drop, since he's destroyed my whole life's happiness!” Remarkable guy. Not to be messed with.]]></string>

<string id="520052"><![CDATA[That's what he said! I'm not saying anything! We said there'd been no one like that around, and we didn't know anything about a murderer. “I'll go to the thieves then," he said, "they'll be glad to trade his head for some shiny coin.”]]></string>
<string id="520053"><![CDATA[What else did he say?]]></string>
<string id="520054"><![CDATA[Said he wasn't afraid. "I know he's keen on tearing people to tatters," he said, "but he'll have a different sort of conversation with me." Turned up the flap of his cloak, and there was a revolver underneath!]]></string>
<string id="520055"><![CDATA[I see. Thank you, Notkin.]]></string>
<string id="520056"><![CDATA[So he's looking for me…]]></string>
<string id="520057"><![CDATA[He is. Said there'll be no mercy when he finds you. Looks like he and Grief have set up some kind of trap for the murderer... Anyway, he said he'd off Simon's murderer before the day was out if it cost him his life. “If he finds me before I find him," he said, "it's a fatality. And vice versa."]]></string>

<string id="520074"><![CDATA[I got it, I got it. Go on.]]></string>
<string id="520075"><![CDATA[Obviously, the rats are different each time. It's about the tracks. Say, a rat took the Smarty Pants track; it has to pass all twelve checkpoints. If it comes first, it wins. If you were smart enough to bet on it, you win. That’s it.]]></string>
<string id="520076"><![CDATA[How do I place my bet?]]></string>
<string id="520077"><![CDATA[You don't. You only bring the rat. Your rat's track is the closest one. If it wins, we'll buy it from you. We'll give as much as 500 coins for a strong rat!]]></string>

<string id="520103"><![CDATA[Mark is mocking what is going on in the theatre. He's got some show-booth going on there. He declared that tonight will be a wonderful night, and today the people will see some new underground prophet. One, who controlled the prophecy pantomimes.]]></string>
<string id="520104"><![CDATA[Can that be a reason for sorrow?]]></string>
<string id="520105"><![CDATA[That is very bad. Mark is inviting any, who wish, to speak to their dead parents. All of the children of us, that have returned, say that it is all correct. But I know that Mark is an excellent trickster! Why is he doing this?]]></string>
<string id="520106"><![CDATA[Do you miss your mother?]]></string>
<string id="520107"><![CDATA[Oh, what if this is my only chance to hear my mommy! It would be no good letting such a chance go... But I'm so afraid that it's only a show and Mark's pranks... then I would insult my mother's memory. I will be forced to kill him!]]></string>
<string id="520108"><![CDATA[Calm down. I'll go and take a look. Perhaps this Mark will reveal to me, what he is hiding from the others.]]></string>
<string id="520109"><![CDATA[Oh, please! The main thing - find out whether it is clear lie or not. He will probably be scared to play tricks on you.]]></string>
<string id="520110"><![CDATA[Yes, I'm not someone to play with.]]></string>
<string id="520111"><![CDATA[What kind of prophet?]]></string>
<string id="520112"><![CDATA[So I'm thinking, what if it's all correct? Cause the pantomimes did come true! Nobody knew how Mark manages to perform such things. We thought it was a masterful trick. But now that he declared that there is a being that is a kind of emissary of the two worlds there...]]></string>

<string id="520114"><![CDATA[Don't go there, Kapella. It's only a bad joke.]]></string>

<string id="520127"><![CDATA[I'll try. How do I know if the prophet answered my question?]]></string>
<string id="520128"><![CDATA[Oh, my dear, come on... There is no prophet there. There is no point in ascending the stage, it is even more pointless asking questions. This is simply a prank... For those, who are in despair.]]></string>
<string id="520129"><![CDATA[It is strange that you should play these jokes at a time like this.]]></string>

<string id="520132"><![CDATA[And you will be absolutely correct! Just the word you said it is - "trickery"! Em... yes... perhaps you want to test how powerful the prophet is? Ask him a question, an answer to which he could know by no means...]]></string>

<string id="520139"><![CDATA[What happened?]]></string>
<string id="520140"><![CDATA[The ground crumbled beneath the workers. They climbed down the hole and saw an opening there. Seems like the bottom of this creephole is made of the same hard material that any previous digging efforts died against.]]></string>
<string id="520141"><![CDATA[A creephole?]]></string>
<string id="520142"><![CDATA[It's a whole cave. Those good-for-nothings tried to convince me they had seen a light there, heard groans and muffled singing. Nonsense... Those worker types are unbearably superstitious... So now they won't go down—not for love or money. Not a single person brave enough among them. Turns out I am once again doing something blasphemous.]]></string>
<string id="520143"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="520144"><![CDATA[Same reason you're discouraged from cutting dead bodies open... According to them, we're opening the body of the earth, illegally and shamelessly. This sudden discovery has reminded them that Mother Boddho is a living breathing being just like anyone else... Do you fancy this cave to be a part of her digestive system?]]></string>
<string id="520145"><![CDATA[I'll check that out.]]></string>
<string id="520146"><![CDATA[If you go down there and find out what it is, I'll make it up to you.]]></string>
<string id="520147"><![CDATA[How much do you think you could contribute to an expedition like this?]]></string>
<string id="520148"><![CDATA[Seven thousand. That is all I can donate these days. And... two recipes. I've acquired them when the Worms were killing their traitors.]]></string>
<string id="520149"><![CDATA[Deal.]]></string>
<string id="520150"><![CDATA[No, that's not enough.]]></string>
<string id="520151"><![CDATA[I will do it free of charge. I'm curious myself.]]></string>
<string id="520152"><![CDATA[Of course not. Are you out of your mind? It's her vascular system!]]></string>
<string id="520153"><![CDATA[They have a point…]]></string>
<string id="520154"><![CDATA[So there have been digging attempts before? And they've died? I've never even heard of it…]]></string>
<string id="520155"><![CDATA[Of course there have been digging attempts. A lot of them. This isn't the first time we've tried to dig a well here—but it's no use. Not a single drop of water. The idea was tossed around that there's sintered sand or whinstone down below… There are always ideas. So I've got a new theory now...]]></string>
<string id="520156"><![CDATA[So what is down there?]]></string>
<string id="520157"><![CDATA[I'd go there myself if it weren't for my claustrophobia...]]></string>

<string id="520165"><![CDATA[Congratulations. So what is it?]]></string>
<string id="520166"><![CDATA[It's a tunnel someone's dug from under The Theatre.]]></string>
<string id="520167"><![CDATA[Who would do something like that?]]></string>
<string id="520168"><![CDATA[I think I've met a weird creature there, but it could have been a hallucination.]]></string>

<string id="520170"><![CDATA[Yes! Do you know what it is?]]></string>
<string id="520171"><![CDATA[…Curious. Very curious. I think it's an illusion. A spectre appearing to very different people on some creature's will… You've fallen prey to hypnosis. What did it say to you?]]></string>
<string id="520172"><![CDATA[It spoke about my father. It was all very unclear.]]></string>
<string id="520173"><![CDATA[Here is the reward for your courage, master Burakh. Thank you. Let us never mention it again.]]></string>
<string id="520174"><![CDATA[Now that is curious!]]></string>
<string id="520175"><![CDATA[But who was the hypnotist?]]></string>
<string id="520176"><![CDATA[Well... No idea. Some people say it's rats. They have special powers, you know... Others say it's the earth—Suok's vapors... More nonsense.... Yeah. Still, it's known for a fact that the illusion appears to The Town's inhabitants from time to time. It's a well-known spectre. We call him the Rat Prophet.]]></string>
<string id="520177"><![CDATA[It's hard to wrap my head around all that…]]></string>
<string id="520178"><![CDATA[I don't know. There is nothing there.]]></string>
<string id="520179"><![CDATA[A rather old cave. You were right—its bottom doesn't look like soil at all.]]></string>

<string id="520217"><![CDATA[So here you are… until recently you've been thought to have murdered Simon Kain, fifteen other men whose names I'd be damned to remember, and Isidor Burakh, your own father. Is that correct?]]></string>
<string id="520218"><![CDATA[Fifteen?]]></string>
<string id="520219"><![CDATA[Yes. As time went by, the turnskin commited more and more murders; the turnskin whose description somehow fits your features to a tee.]]></string>
<string id="520220"><![CDATA[Oh. It all makes sense now.]]></string>
<string id="520221"><![CDATA[I've been hunting you all day, and just as I was about to finally catch you, I've found out you're innocent of Simon's—and by extention Isidor's—deaths.]]></string>

<string id="520226"><![CDATA[Is this where my father used to work?]]></string>
<string id="520227"><![CDATA[Yes. I, personally, have only been here once. There was nothing here then, nothing but tables, instruments, and tools. It seems that Isidor used to spend a lot of time here. Stayed overnight even…]]></string>

<string id="520231"><![CDATA[What is this bulky device?]]></string>
<string id="520232"><![CDATA[This is, in fact, the still. I think the apparatus had a different purpose originally, but your father has fitted it into this... This is where herbs are turned into essences.]]></string>
<string id="520233"><![CDATA[This doesn't really look like lab equipment...]]></string>
<string id="520234"><![CDATA[He used to say that twyre doesn't discriminate. A rather peculiar thing to say, actually, I would have said quite the contrary. I think you'll get the hang of it. How to mix sap with spirits, how to extract oil, how to take care of this monster—it should all be written in his diaries.]]></string>
<string id="520235"><![CDATA[It's too hard...]]></string>
<string id="520236"><![CDATA[It really isn't. The hardest part is acquiring the right herbs. After that it's more or less standard. Into the still go the herbs—there were experiments with different combinations—out of it comes the essence. You could try it with a single herb too, the spirit is already in there.]]></string>
<string id="520237"><![CDATA[I hope it is just as you say.]]></string>
<string id="520238"><![CDATA[Sure.]]></string>
<string id="520239"><![CDATA[What is that thing on the table?]]></string>
<string id="520240"><![CDATA[I'm not sure, but I think Isidor used it to work with organic materials... animal tissues, for example. He extracted the required substances from them.]]></string>
<string id="520241"><![CDATA[How do I use it?]]></string>
<string id="520242"><![CDATA[I don't know exactly. Rubin told me that you put an infected organ into one of its parts and then pour one of the precious twyrine brews into the other. As a result, you get something he called a "gruel"... ugh! There was other equipment here too, a microscope, for example...]]></string>
<string id="520243"><![CDATA[Where are they now?]]></string>

<string id="520273"><![CDATA[Mmmmmmmm..... Nothing can be avoided. Impossible. I can't tell. And the sacrifice is hazy. I still don't know what it will be... I just think it's hardly a person... It's got the soul of a person, the mind of a person, but it's not a person...]]></string>
<string id="520274"><![CDATA[Why do you keep hinting, why can't you just say it straight?]]></string>
<string id="520275"><![CDATA[That would mean mutilating the reality. Haziness defines shapes... a Mistress cannot lie... There's no other way.]]></string>
<string id="520276"><![CDATA[In other words, that's your way of washing your hands of it afterwards.]]></string>
<string id="520277"><![CDATA[I'm on my way.]]></string>
<string id="520278"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="520279"><![CDATA[I managed to preserve your inheritance, if only by a miracle. You can take it all now...]]></string>
<string id="520280"><![CDATA[By a miracle? Why?]]></string>
<string id="520281"><![CDATA[It was almost taken away from me—the orders of those who are in power. They've still managed to snatch some papers I missed. You would have received an empty box... and a pocketful of debts, of course. But today the box is heavy. There, behind your back. Did you get the key?]]></string>
<string id="520282"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="520283"><![CDATA[Take it then. Use it. I hope you'll manage to sort it all out. I can smell twyre or twyrine infusions inside; if I'm correct, then your inheritance is priceless. If the infusions come with the recipes, then it could also become our salvation. There are probably other papers in there too. And I can hear the chinking of coins...]]></string>
<string id="520284"><![CDATA[Who are you?]]></string>
<string id="520285"><![CDATA[I am an evil spirit. That's my origin. My name is Aspity. I am quite harmless—compared to a shabnak... I wreak anxiety and fear, bringing the strangling feeling of the times changing. But you make my heart go round.]]></string>
<string id="520286"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="520287"><![CDATA[I'm not sure yet. What I am sure of, though, is that Fat Vlad is not to be trusted—unlike his daughter. She... she will achieve greatness. Even though she was born of a foul root, her mother was wonderful. I hope she takes after the mother... But Vlad is a swine.]]></string>
<string id="520288"><![CDATA[I am thankful to those who were there to help me in the hour of need.]]></string>
<string id="520289"><![CDATA[I understand what you're saying.]]></string>
<string id="520290"><![CDATA[So the infusions are priceless? Why?]]></string>
<string id="520291"><![CDATA["Why"? Because they're made of herbs, of course! When infused and brewed correctly, almost anything can be extracted from twyre. And swevery! No one knows for sure how much it can do. Well, twyre is the most popular drug, of course. White whip, on the other hand, is thinner and more graceful. You won't be able to handle it if you're not ready to work your fingers to the bone.]]></string>
<string id="520292"><![CDATA[Tell me about yourself.]]></string>
<string id="520293"><![CDATA[Thank you for everything. Farewell.]]></string>
<string id="520294"><![CDATA[What were they looking for?]]></string>
<string id="520295"><![CDATA[I think they wanted to check his notes. To sleuth the killer out. Do you believe that your father was also killed by the disease?]]></string>
<string id="520296"><![CDATA[They say he had a strange wound in his chest.]]></string>
<string id="520297"><![CDATA[...So you know already? He did. The general consensus is that the wound was left by a shabnack-adyg's claw—that's how the hunt after the maneater started. You've been told already, haven't you? A bad idea…]]></string>
<string id="520298"><![CDATA[And who are you?]]></string>
<string id="520299"><![CDATA[You have my gratitude.]]></string>
<string id="520300"><![CDATA[It makes me happy that you came back to us.]]></string>
<string id="520301"><![CDATA[It makes you happy?]]></string>
<string id="520302"><![CDATA[Yes and no... I see the cruel hand of fate in this. Your father died, and the next moment—enter you. Old Burakh was the person we pinned our hopes on—the hopes and expectations he never would have lived up to... but you can. The Earth has expressed its will. The Kin has said its word.]]></string>
<string id="520303"><![CDATA[What do you mean by that?]]></string>
<string id="520304"><![CDATA[I'm superstitious. I can't listen to the Earth like Brides do, but I can listen to the Kin. I know how they feel. They looked up to your father, now they'll look up to you. That is, if they manage to survive to learn of your existence at all, of course.]]></string>
<string id="520305"><![CDATA[Why whouldn't they?]]></string>
<string id="520306"><![CDATA[Because the disease is spreading rapidly. There's nowhere to run from it. The whole Kin—except for a couple of refugees that were lucky enough to be outside when the doors were boarded up—is locked up in the Termitary.]]></string>
<string id="520307"><![CDATA[That's okay. We won't make haste, but we will hurry.]]></string>
<string id="520308"><![CDATA[Who locked them up?]]></string>
<string id="520309"><![CDATA[Fat Vlad. He claims it's because of a riot. He's lying.]]></string>
<string id="520310"><![CDATA[I'll speak to him.]]></string>
<string id="520311"><![CDATA[Why did they love my father so much?]]></string>
<string id="520312"><![CDATA[He was an oynon—a wise man. He could tell justice from injustice instinctively. He could feel the lines nobody even knew about. Some of them aren't even described in the "Tale of the Daughters".]]></string>
<string id="520313"><![CDATA[Lines?]]></string>
<string id="520314"><![CDATA[You've forgotten everything... But that's fine. The things you don't remember will come to you naturally. And if they don't, then that's how it's supposed be. You Burakhs aren't the centre of the world.]]></string>
<string id="520315"><![CDATA[That's for sure.]]></string>
<string id="520316"><![CDATA[Okay, let's leave my father be for now.]]></string>
<string id="520317"><![CDATA[Tell me, do you know how to gather the herbs?]]></string>
<string id="520318"><![CDATA[You won't find anything if you simply walk around looking for it. You have to know the right places. Twyre and swevery are abundant this year, though. Inexplicable! It's just like eleven years ago, when The Cold Tower was built. Basically, you should speak to the Gatherers.]]></string>
<string id="520319"><![CDATA[Who are these gatherers?]]></string>
<string id="520320"><![CDATA[A caste of sorts. Most of them are Worms—although they are going extinct. They've had this internecine war of sorts recently... When people started buying their secrets from them, they resorted to killing one another. There was this short-lived trend—everyone wanted to try smoky twyrine for a while... and some Worms were tempted to allow this.]]></string>
<string id="520321"><![CDATA[Where can I find them?]]></string>
<string id="520322"><![CDATA[There were three Worms on the town's border not so long ago... Someone was being hunted, tried to flee the town, and they were waiting for the victim's death. I'll show you approximately where they are, you can go from there. But they don't usually stay in place for long—they travel and break camps for the night.]]></string>
<string id="520323"><![CDATA[Thank you, Aspity.]]></string>
<string id="520324"><![CDATA[Tell me more about the infusions.]]></string>
<string id="520325"><![CDATA[They have a lot of various properties. At the moment, what you should care about most is that they can serve as medicine that's no longer found in drugstores. Some of them can work as protective substances—they boost your immunity, take a look. Some are painkillers. Some quench hunger. Some mitigate exhaustion.]]></string>
<string id="520326"><![CDATA[Not bad.]]></string>
<string id="520327"><![CDATA[Tell me about twyre.]]></string>
<string id="520328"><![CDATA[It transforms any substance. If you want to continue your father's practices, you'll need to stock up on herbs. Some of them are even stronger, you know—white whip, for example.]]></string>
<string id="520329"><![CDATA[I will heed your advice.]]></string>
<string id="520330"><![CDATA[I cannot share your happiness for now.]]></string>
<string id="520331"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="520332"><![CDATA[Have you come into your father's inheritance yet?]]></string>
<string id="520333"><![CDATA[What's in it to you?]]></string>
<string id="520334"><![CDATA[Because it's likely to contain valuable information. I am, of course, quite sceptical towards those... prehistoric practices... But these days anything could be of help—considering the circumstances. Does the inheritance include your father's notes?]]></string>
<string id="520335"><![CDATA[It might.]]></string>
<string id="520336"><![CDATA[I am currently studying the records of the First Outbreak. If at least a tenth of those accounts is true, then a catastrophe is upon us. Yet Isidor Burakh had found a way to overcome the beast. If there are any notes on that left, they may save us all.]]></string>
<string id="520337"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="520338"><![CDATA[Alexander Saburov—the person that was supposed to pass the inheritance on to you—appears to be a ruthless and obsessed zealot. And he regards you as an enemy, I gather. That's too bad. But I've managed to at least convince him to restrain his ardour for now.]]></string>
<string id="520339"><![CDATA[I'm beginning to like you, oynon.]]></string>
<string id="520340"><![CDATA[The only evidence against you Alexander has is his wife's dream. Everyone in the town believes she's clairvoyant. Yesterday she foretold me quite confidently that I was about to die before sunset, and yet… Oh well. Hurry up and get your inheritance! And don't be afraid of Saburov.]]></string>
<string id="520341"><![CDATA[I'm on my way.]]></string>
<string id="520342"><![CDATA[Don't underestimate Katerina. Thank you anyway though.]]></string>
<string id="520343"><![CDATA[Do I look like a dead person to you?]]></string>
<string id="520344"><![CDATA[No. But I'd be alert if I were you.]]></string>
<string id="520345"><![CDATA[Right, more wonderful news…]]></string>
<string id="520346"><![CDATA[I don't know.]]></string>
<string id="520347"><![CDATA[Not yet.]]></string>
<string id="520348"><![CDATA[So? Did you find any notes inside?]]></string>
<string id="520349"><![CDATA[I did.]]></string>
<string id="520350"><![CDATA[May I have a look?]]></string>
<string id="520351"><![CDATA[You may.]]></string>
<string id="520352"><![CDATA[.......]]></string>
<string id="520353"><![CDATA[So do you have a plan?]]></string>
<string id="520354"><![CDATA[I thought there would be more... Never mind. Try to figure out how those formulas work—they might be of some use to us. I do believe you and I will produce better results if we turn this into a collaborative project. Next. I've heard that you're being supported by the Olgimskys, is that correct?]]></string>
<string id="520355"><![CDATA[Yes, that is true.]]></string>
<string id="520356"><![CDATA[The father is obviously too busy right now, but the son seems to be a reasonable young man. Ask him if there's any equipment in the town that could be used to make these… mixtures. He is likely to know where we can get a distiller of some sort.]]></string>
<string id="520357"><![CDATA[That's a sound piece of advice.]]></string>
<string id="520358"><![CDATA[If you learn how to synthesize those reagents or at least get a sample, bring it to me please. I'll try to examine it and find out how it can be used—if at all.]]></string>
<string id="520359"><![CDATA[Deal.]]></string>
<string id="520360"><![CDATA[I can handle this on my own.]]></string>
<string id="520361"><![CDATA[No. I don't trust them.]]></string>
<string id="520362"><![CDATA[There are many people that would give their lives for these mixtures' secret formulas, oynon.]]></string>
<string id="520363"><![CDATA[No need—I can tell you what they are. These are twyre infusions recipes. Seems like father didn't actually treat the sick with them, but rather used them as drug components.]]></string>
<string id="520364"><![CDATA[You may not.]]></string>
<string id="520365"><![CDATA[What's the point of making a secret out of it? Your father's actions during the First Outbreak were thoroughly recorded, and I have the records right here. I'll get to those recipes sooner or later anyway.]]></string>
<string id="520366"><![CDATA[I can't.]]></string>
<string id="520367"><![CDATA[Fine. Have a look.]]></string>
<string id="520368"><![CDATA[Nothing special about them.]]></string>
<string id="520369"><![CDATA[We're in a tough spot, wouldn't you agree…?]]></string>
<string id="520370"><![CDATA[I've managed to get a sample of one of the infusions. Have a look. Is it in any way useful?]]></string>
<string id="520372"><![CDATA[So what is it?]]></string>
<string id="520373"><![CDATA[Just as I thought. A natural agent. I'm beginning to work on getting a sample of the microbial culture from dead tissue tomorrow; I could also see how the tissue would react to this solution. Perhaps it can be used to fractionate blood; if it can, we may find a way to cure even a terminal patient.]]></string>
<string id="520374"><![CDATA[Why do that?]]></string>
<string id="520375"><![CDATA[Why fractionate blood? Come on... That's how you make a simple serum. You extract the bacterial culture, then inject it into a bull's or a horse's body. Then we extract the beast's blood with the antibodies that have already been produced by its immune system. We fractionate it too, purify it—and then it may be injected into a human body. The original serum can theoretically be obtained by trial and error.]]></string>
<string id="520376"><![CDATA[I know how serum is made, thank you very much. Why test the reaction of the tissue to the protective solution?]]></string>
<string id="520377"><![CDATA[I want to see how the microbial culture would react to it.]]></string>
<string id="520378"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="520379"><![CDATA[If we had tissue-treating equipment and a distiller to process the herbs, we could try different components… We'd get what we're looking for sooner or later.]]></string>
<string id="520380"><![CDATA[That's not as big of an issue as it seems. Consider me having everything we need.]]></string>
<string id="520381"><![CDATA[Oh? Then get down to experiments, Burakh. Study the recipes, make infusions, and treat organ specimens with them. In the end you should obtain something resembling... antibiotics. Bring your samples here, we'll check their effects. Come back when you have the first sample. I'll start working on dead tissues.]]></string>
<string id="520382"><![CDATA[So those antibiotics are like… panacea prototypes? All right. I'll bring you good samples when I obtain some.]]></string>
<string id="520383"><![CDATA[If only I knew where to look for those things…]]></string>
<string id="520384"><![CDATA[I'm sure young Olgimsky knows this town inside out—especially anything that may resemble useful facilities. It was the Olgimskys that have built the Olgimskys' factory, after all. And that must have required equipment. Talk to him.]]></string>
<string id="520385"><![CDATA[We'll see. And we'll find a way.]]></string>
<string id="520386"><![CDATA[Seems like this panacea is going to become crucial to my success.]]></string>
<string id="520387"><![CDATA[I'll get down to that then.]]></string>
<string id="520388"><![CDATA[What are you working on now, oynon?]]></string>
<string id="520389"><![CDATA[I'm looking for the source of the outbreak. I need hard evidence. Those backwards fanatics are still obsessed with searching for Simon's murderer instead of trying to make preparations for the epidemic. I fear that they're about to tear even more "maneaters" to pieces…]]></string>
<string id="520390"><![CDATA[Allow me to offer you a piece of advice then. Go visit my father's house. It's in the Skinners.]]></string>

<string id="520425"><![CDATA[Yeah! One big cheese doc came by. An outsider. If he stays here, maybe I should make friends with him... He'd make a good replacement for old Isidor.

<string id="520426"><![CDATA[What did he say?]]></string>
<string id="520427"><![CDATA[He said he'd kill you! A dangerous bloke, he is. A fop if I've ever seen one, but there's somethin' in his eye... I wouldn't cross him, even with 'em fists of yours. Be careful, mate. He's got himself hard fists too, that bloke.]]></string>

<string id="520432"><![CDATA[I'm innocent.]]></string>

<string id="520527"><![CDATA[Yesterday's experiment produced mixed results. It was helpful to me; we've managed to grab the bacteria by the tail, so the vaccine will become available to the general public soon. But the usefulness of living blood for serum production is… partial.]]></string>
<string id="520528"><![CDATA[Are there antibodies in it?]]></string>
<string id="520529"><![CDATA[There are; they are even quite efficient at exterminating the disease. But the antibodies get annihilated in the process too, and the disease reproduces rapidly—so they are not enough. The final result is rather disappointing. In order to overcome the sickness, cells need to either suppress the development of the disease or produce a thousand times more antibodies.]]></string>
<string id="520530"><![CDATA[So what do we do?]]></string>
<string id="520531"><![CDATA[Let's try the proven method. We should introduce the disease to bulls and see what happens next. I've been eyeing the animal kingdom for a while now. Epidemics have been connected to cattle since the dawn of time! And the local cattle are so inaccessible, they're guarded so vigilantly that I'm not even sure where to begin.]]></string>
<string id="520532"><![CDATA[If bulls were the cause of this, it would all have started with a murrain.]]></string>
<string id="520533"><![CDATA[Why are you so sure there was none? ]]></string>
<string id="520534"><![CDATA[I think we would've been able to tell. There would've been smoke and unbearable stench filling the town.]]></string>
<string id="520535"><![CDATA[Well, perhaps they don't get sick at all. All the more reason to check them. Do try it. Make a blood extract and introduce it to a bull—we'll see how its blood reacts to this unexpected turn of events. Thankfully we do have a bacteria sample now.]]></string>
<string id="520536"><![CDATA[Have you found a use for it yet?]]></string>
<string id="520537"><![CDATA[I have. The vaccine is ready. But I'm talking about your work. The plan is straightforward.]]></string>
<string id="520538"><![CDATA[I'm not so sure…]]></string>
<string id="520539"><![CDATA[Just let us repeat yesterday's test. Make an extract. Infect a bull. Wait a bit and get a blood sample. I think the result is going to be quite enlightening.]]></string>
<string id="520540"><![CDATA[I'll try to find a bull. Hopefully they haven't all been eaten by now.]]></string>

<string id="520563"><![CDATA[No. I wanted to see you because I know what you're planning to do. You know the Lines, don't you? Listen to me then. Two lines have crossed today. You want to kill a bull, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="520564"><![CDATA[I don't. But I do need one.]]></string>
<string id="520565"><![CDATA[I can even tell you why you need it. You want to introduce the disease to a bull and see who wins, right? I foretell you a draw.]]></string>
<string id="520566"><![CDATA[What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="520567"><![CDATA[I'm not sure about that myself, but my feelings rarely deceive me. The eternal drama will unfold here today, but it will be performed poorly, Burakh. Have you read The Tales of the Daughters? Remember how Bos Turokh have created the Wheel, Time, and Fear?]]></string>
<string id="520568"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="520569"><![CDATA[Listen then! There was a time when there were neither day nor night; neither top nor bottom; neither sea nor land. There was but one thing in the world, and it was the great Bull, the Father of Flesh, the Carver of Lines, the Bearer of Horns—Bos Turokh. Up from the abyss came Suok, and she filled the world with herself. She devoured all the stars and all the light...]]></string>
<string id="520570"><![CDATA[...Wait a second. If there was nothing but the great Bull, where did the stars and light come from?]]></string>
<string id="520571"><![CDATA[Oh, don't interrupt! ...And she devoured the sunlight. Neither fire nor water could harm Suok, neither old age not the abyss itself. It was darkness then. Bos Turokh, the great Bull, had frozen in the darkness; his cry was strong enough to pierce it, but it couldn't pierce Suok. She spread herself further, and there was darkness once again.]]></string>
<string id="520572"><![CDATA[I think I know of this story.]]></string>
<string id="520573"><![CDATA[And so Bos Turokh in his despair opened his mouth horizon-to-horizon and started devouring Suok. Oh, how she struggled trying to flee back to the abyss! And yet she came to be devoured by Bos Turokh bit by bit. To this day she is inside of him, trying in vain to consume him from within his tight embrace.]]></string>
<string id="520574"><![CDATA[That's some story.]]></string>
<string id="520575"><![CDATA[Intriguing, huh? There's more to it. I can feel you moulding this tale out of clay. You want to feed the disease to a bull to see whether it can overcome it or not. That would serve me well. If you succeed, everyone will leave me alone. Want me to help you?]]></string>
<string id="520576"><![CDATA[Eh… fine.]]></string>
<string id="520577"><![CDATA[Then your way lies towards the Short Block of the Termitary. A very important person will be waiting for you there.

<string id="520603"><![CDATA[Right! I'll show you where this bull is bellowing! Just the kind you need—his sides steep; his forehead marked with a star; his coat plaited; his horns so far apart that four odonghs could walk between them… A lovely little bull.]]></string>

<string id="520697"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="520698"><![CDATA[I guess I know who stands before me... I know of your tragedy, my boy. I am Vladislav Olgimsky, boös... you probably don't remember me. I am wholly at your disposal... Somehow I didn't expect you to be so young…]]></string>

<string id="520708"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="520709"><![CDATA[Yes... Far be it from me to call myself a person of mystical inclinations. However, when I look at you, I get the feeling that nature is playing jokes on us. It's as if both the left and the right hand have clutched the head to realize for the first time that they are two parts of a single whole.]]></string>
<string id="520710"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="520711"><![CDATA[I don't know. We can become enemies so easily, Artemy Burakh, that it would be best for us to make every possible effort to stay friends until our points of view diverge irreparably. I am Bachelor Dankovsky. Do you agree with me?]]></string>

Sorrowfully,
Daniil Dankovsky

P.S. I'll have you know that my own mission of identifying the disease carrier was likewise a fiasco. Apparently, the creature I am trying to catch does not exist either. A feeble consolation, I know, but perhaps it'll help you see how much I feel for you.

<string id="520963"><![CDATA[Georgiy and Victor Kain were interrogated by the Inquisitor yesterday. According to Maria, you won't survive this meeting. The Inquisitor has proven too intelligent to believe the Ripper tales, and astute enough to acknowledge what kind of discovery you are set out to make.

Long story short, the Kains believe that she will have you killed as soon as you tell her you know how a panacea can be produced. I am not sure what the logic behind this may be, but they're positive of their suspicion.

Speaking of panacea, do you really know how to make one? I for one would be most pleased if you did!
Be very careful with the Inquisitor. She is in charge of the patrolmen now; they follow her orders.

V. O. (the Younger)

P.S. The Mother Superior wanted to meet you. Please do not leave her if you learn that she may be in danger! She is a very, very unhappy child, but she has a heart of gold. It is imperative that she survives. The Inquisitor will open the Termitary today, I think...]]></string>

Nevertheless, the town is alive. It has a head, a heart, and a belly. There are veins running through its massive body. The town has its own memory; it breathes, it thinks, and it feels fear. Who knows, perhaps the town can even feel love?

A world in which towns have a heartbeat is the world I want to live in. I want to feel the earth tossing and turning beneath my feet.]]></string>

P.S. I am worried by Aglaya Lilich's behaviour of late. She was asking me of your whereabouts.

<string id="521457"><![CDATA[Tycheek's daughter is not a fretful child. She seems confused, as though the Changeling has bewitched her with whatever sorcerous power she is possessed of.

<string id="521460"><![CDATA[This means I didn't claim the entirety of my father's inheritance! Symbols, symbols! Everywhere I look there are signs to be deciphered. Did Aspity lie to me? I can't believe it... But then why do they all avert their eyes whenever I mention my inheritance?]]></string>
<string id="521461"><![CDATA[I'm getting closer to the answer. Aspity tries to take care of me. And the Foreman... He acts as if he is waiting for me to strangle him with my bare hands. I should return to him... with this horn.]]></string>

<string id="522197"><![CDATA[Insofar as the victory over the enemy is comparable to learning its nature, we see you as our champion as well as our scholar. We think it would be appropriate to inform you of the conditions of your victory.

We hope you appreciate the fact that the disease is nothing more than an unfortunate coincidence. You should treat this as a basis for your research, for if the outbreak is entirely accidental—as the lack of any outside influence on the town suggests—then it should be comparatively easy to handle.

Avoid multiplying casualties. Seek an answer in unorthodox methodologies. The cause of the outbreak is not of a fundamentally familiar nature, so you may need an... adventure, of sorts, to remove it.]]></string>
<string id="522198"><![CDATA[The Evening Letter from the Powers That Be. Day Three]]></string>
<string id="522199"><![CDATA[We have been informed that you have composed a set of instructions for the civilians and initiated the preparation of the town to combat the epidemic. You have ordered the establishment of a hospital and an isolation ward, and are working on setting up other institutions—the morgue, to name one—that the town was previously lacking.

These decisions place you in the context of higher responsibility. No longer an army of one, you have decided to mobilise the population to fight the disease alongside you, since your personal accomplishments were not enough.

We expect that the measures you have taken are temporary. Speaking of what may be described as the microclimate of the town, we don't want any irreversible changes to take place. In particular, we hope that the instructions you have issued would not lead to any undesirable moods among the local townsfolk. We would rather avoid mass psychosis, depression, or panic that are sometimes characteristic of situations like this.

Please keep in mind that when we offered to cease the persecution of your laboratory and to facilitate your research, we meant that as a reward for you being able to find a surgically precise solution to the problem. It is of no importance to us if you do it yourself or instigate the Inquisitor to do it on your behalf.]]></string>
<string id="522200"><![CDATA[The Evening Letter from the Powers That Be. Day Four]]></string>
<string id="522201"><![CDATA[And so the microbe was captured. The formula for the vaccine has been discovered. Judging by the reports we have received, this is the keystone of your strategy to halt the outbreak.

However, if you would allow us to remind you the conditions of our agreement; your strategy should also accomplish the final goal, which is to reveal the source of the disease and destroy it, to make reemergence of the epidemic impossible.

You gave your word that you will wipe the disease from the face of the Earth, and this is something we would like to count on. Even more so since your investigation of the carrier hypothesis suggests that the outbreak was a matter of contingency.

We approve of the direction your investigation has taken; everything seems to be in line with the expectations we had of you. The only circumstance we find regrettable is that you did not manage to destroy the creature earlier.

We hope you will deal with the source of the infection tomorrow. After it is done, you should report your success to the Inquisitor and return to the Capital. Back at the Thanatica laboratory, you will find a special decree permitting you to proceed with your private studies as well as equity to provide for whatever research costs you may incur.]]></string>
<string id="522202"><![CDATA[The Evening Letter from the Powers That Be. Day Five]]></string>
<string id="522203"><![CDATA[We are disappointed to say the least. You have only one opportunity left to emerge victorious. You must submit to the Inquisitor immediately.

In addition to that, we would like to remind you that although the first and foremost responsibility of the Inquisitor is to halt the outbreak no matter what it takes, we have reason to believe that her particular skillset will allow her to accomplish victory with as little collateral damage as possible.

To clarify our instructions we would like to specify that by "no matter what it takes" we mean that human casualties should not be taken into consideration. Even if every single person in the town dies, the outcome will be fully acceptable as long as the pestilence is eradicated.

The town itself, however, must survive. Not even minor damage to the settlement will be condoned. The loss of the town would make everything else totally pointless. Because of this, we request the Cathedral to be brought back to its original state, and the Theatre to resume the staging of plays.

Remember: No matter what it takes.]]></string>
<string id="522204"><![CDATA[The Evening Letter from the Powers That Be. Day Six]]></string>
<string id="522205"><![CDATA[Yes, they've played a cruel joke on us.

You know, Dankovsky, there are costs involved in being who we are. People like us, ingenious to an extent of being dangerous, are always put on the frontline. They set us goals which are as pointless as they are impossible to achieve, in a desperate bid that we figure out how to deal with them. We are a low value card which may be of use if it wins and worth no regret if it is beaten.

Having been made aware of this attitude we have no choice but to avenge it. I detest hypocrisy, as do you, I believe... Let us make the hypocrites regret their sanctimony. Their smug self-assurance is based on their deluded belief that we will not be able to carry out their orders. Did they advise you to deal with the plague in a manner your conscience would suggest? Do that, have no fear. I've been told to eradicate the disease at any cost, and as elegantly as possible.

This is what they are going to get.

We'll discuss the matter tomorrow, however. This was my desperation speaking. Burn the letter.

<string id="522207"><![CDATA[The army will arrive any moment now.

I am worried about Block. There is a good reason people compare him to Attila the Hun. But with all that, he is a man of honour. If he finds out that his orders were issued with the sole purpose of creating an illusion of safety and care for the common benefit—he may decide to punish the Powers That Be by carrying out their request as literally as possible.

This kind of decision on his behalf is bound to interfere with our plans. Please keep this in mind when you speak to him. Undoubtedly, he is going to tell you that I am pulling your strings... that I am not a person to be trusted. Do not oppose him. Agree with anything he says insofar as it helps you drive his thoughts away from vengeance. It seems that I am slightly more humane than I thought, so I would rather avoid having to destroy the town completely.

I think you would concur that the less collateral damage there is—the better. The town is not a pleasant sight, I grant you, but still it is alive.

Take care,

Or, putting it bluntly, it would help me if you agreed to conduct a detailed inspection of the Tower. I trust the construction was brought to your attention before, one way or another.

If you have indeed established that the walls of the Tower provide effective isolation from the disease—why didn't you elaborate on this possible solution? If you have found that the construction is too unstable, why didn't you evacuate the children? I am looking forward to hearing your opinion on the matter tomorrow.

As of now I have no reason to suspect him of being short-sighted, let alone dishonest. If I understand him right, the character of the local soil renders geodesic reports unnecessary. Both the earth and the water here appear to be pure.

But what caused the outbreak in this case? I'd rather not recur to the carrier hypothesis. After all, we only have one day left.

A. Lilich, Inquisitor]]></string>
<string id="522212"><![CDATA[The Evening Letter from the Inquisitor. Day Ten]]></string>
<string id="522213"><![CDATA[So be it. Tomorrow they are going to pay the full price of their arrogance. Each one of us will keep their word and fulfill their duty. We will appease the higher justice—and in doing so avenge ourselves.

Not one of us is going to act against the Truth.

Congratulations, Dankovsky. Our elegant manoeuvre was a success. We took the winnings, and placed our opponents into a position in which they have no other choice but to vanish.

The Council is tomorrow. Legal considerations require it be held in the presence of someone serving as a representative of the local authorities. The three ruling families are completely bankrupt, however, so the so-called "Mistress" will attend the council in their stead. She will vouch for our intentions before the townsfolk.

Do you have any binding obligations towards the families in power? If so, this  may become an issue tomorrow. It would be a shame if you weren't allowed to attend the proceedings. Alas, the law is the law and I won't be able to do anything about it.

<string id="522262"><![CDATA[That isn't as funny as you might think. If those were Kaspar's Dogheads, then it's all the same—they are nothing more than little soldiers. What do they want from him?]]></string>
<string id="522263"><![CDATA[He gave them blank cartridges instead of the service ones.]]></string>
<string id="522264"><![CDATA[I think they want him dead.]]></string>
<string id="522265"><![CDATA[Could you find out more and get him out of there?]]></string>
<string id="522266"><![CDATA[I see. He did indeed collect some ammo—but he didn't want to supply the children with service cartridges. He feared they'd start shooting… Thought the Dogheads may provoke the soldiers into destroying the Tower…]]></string>

<string id="522278"><![CDATA[No! We took him out. He gave Khan blank cartridges instead of real ones. And swindling Khan isn't a smart thing to do—his temper is short. He let the Bachelor live for now out of respect. Perhaps the man changes his mind and spills the beans…]]></string>
<string id="522279"><![CDATA[So, where is he now?]]></string>
<string id="522280"><![CDATA[They took him to the Works. He'll be subject to extreme interrogation techniques there. Just tell everyone he's not here if you're asked. Especially since that's true.]]></string>

<string id="522302"><![CDATA[I used aurochs blood. An aurochs is a rare creature. You can say they're extinct.]]></string>

<string id="522311"><![CDATA[I know nothing of it.]]></string>
<string id="522312"><![CDATA[Good. That is very good! You deserve a commendation.]]></string>
<string id="522313"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="522314"><![CDATA[Because now, thanks to you, the Inquisitor has no reason to be here. She can end her short leave and march back to the scaffold. She won't be getting in my way, and that'll make things easier for us.]]></string>
<string id="522315"><![CDATA[To the scaffold?]]></string>
<string id="522316"><![CDATA[What are you planning to do, general?]]></string>
<string id="522319"><![CDATA[How much do you need?]]></string>
<string id="522320"><![CDATA[How much? Hundreds of litres. Enough to cure everyone infected here and send an emergency batch to the Capital.]]></string>

<string id="522322"><![CDATA[Ancient blood? What is this rubbish even supposed to mean? Blood can only be living, that you don't have to explain to me. And why is the chance elusive?]]></string>

<string id="522326"><![CDATA[Naturally.]]></string>
<string id="522327"><![CDATA[I've heard that you are a Steppe man yourself. Can you gain this subterranean Foreman's trust and find out how to get the abominable blood?]]></string>
<string id="522328"><![CDATA[That's the most curious part. Why is it still living and where is it stored?]]></string>
<string id="522329"><![CDATA[And how are you planning to handle it once we have it?]]></string>
<string id="522330"><![CDATA[Divine then. Whatever. It doesn't matter. What matters is that it would allow me to neither bombard a homeland town nor kill civilians.]]></string>

<string id="522334"><![CDATA[Yessir.]]></string>
<string id="522335"><![CDATA[I? You'll be the one to do the handling. I will simply report to the Capital—mission successful, conscience clear.

<string id="522340"><![CDATA[She's sentenced to death. Her leave here was the final chance for her to rehabilitate herself. She will be cleared of all charges if she finds a solution and wins; otherwise the verdict continues to apply. But she deserves it fully, so don't worry.]]></string>

<string id="522352"><![CDATA[Panacea isn't poison. How are you planning to kill Aglaya with it?]]></string>
<string id="522353"><![CDATA[It will happen automatically. If she returns to the Capital with her mission failed, she loses her head in an hour. Merry runs the bloody river and all that.]]></string>
<string id="522354"><![CDATA[The invention of a panacea is not a failure, it's a success.]]></string>
<string id="522355"><![CDATA[...But not her success. It wasn't she that invented the panacea, was it? Her mission, by the way, is saving the town from destruction. But if there's not enough panacea, I won't have the moral right to pull back my guns.]]></string>
<string id="522356"><![CDATA[Do you really want to destroy the town?]]></string>
<string id="522357"><![CDATA[No. Not at all.]]></string>
<string id="522358"><![CDATA[Yet you want Aglaya to die.]]></string>
<string id="522359"><![CDATA[My personal feelings are irrelevant. Only my duty is. I do indeed hate Aglaya. I can foresee her tricking me and turning my weapons against me. She will get what she wants, no matter what I do. I want her off the board—but no one's asking me what I want.]]></string>

<string id="522365"><![CDATA[I haven't gone far. They seized me almost immediately. I would have died a grim death if not for the Commander. The military came in the nick of time—I'm inclined to think of their intervention as of a miracle.]]></string>

<string id="522369"><![CDATA[Did you take... the blood from there?]]></string>
<string id="522370"><![CDATA[I didn't. It wasn't the reason why I went there in the first place—I wanted to take a soil sample and talk to the Foreman… He didn't seem the talkative type though.]]></string>

<string id="522372"><![CDATA[Who has?]]></string>

<string id="522374"><![CDATA[Where did they go?]]></string>
<string id="522375"><![CDATA[I took no notice of it. It was dark. Also I ran inside immediately.]]></string>

<string id="522377"><![CDATA[What kind of ammo?]]></string>
<string id="522378"><![CDATA[Military. 7'62, I think... Common military rifle ammo. I hope they shoot each other with them.]]></string>
<string id="522379"><![CDATA[They are impossible to get!]]></string>
<string id="522380"><![CDATA[Take the ones I left at Eva's—the Stillwater, first floor. They probably won't be enough, but at least we won't have to fight the riflemen. Go get them somehow.]]></string>

<string id="522393"><![CDATA[I have come to ask you, Elder One.]]></string>
<string id="522394"><![CDATA[Ask once. There is no second question.]]></string>
<string id="522395"><![CDATA[Who killed my father?]]></string>
<string id="522396"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="522397"><![CDATA[A question heard! You will have an answer. Becaurse you want knowledge. A suckling craving meat. A spineless creature begging for a heavy burden. You will not withstand big knowledge. I know what you want to ask.]]></string>
<string id="522398"><![CDATA[Why won't I withstand big knowledge?]]></string>
<string id="522399"><![CDATA[You have asked once already. Get out.]]></string>
<string id="522400"><![CDATA[Test me.]]></string>
<string id="522401"><![CDATA[Really? And what do I want to ask you?]]></string>
<string id="522402"><![CDATA[I made a mistake.]]></string>
<string id="522403"><![CDATA[I see. I hear.]]></string>
<string id="522404"><![CDATA[Your father was killed by the horn of Bos Nuhdr, a bull massive, red-skinned, his lines fomed by Suok's song. Mother Boddho's warmth, the blood in her earthen womb, or any of the Mistresses will speak to the truth of my words, for they cannot lie.  ]]></string>
<string id="522405"><![CDATA[Your answer clarifies nothing.]]></string>
<string id="522406"><![CDATA[Because you do not know how to ask. You are thick.]]></string>
<string id="522407"><![CDATA[I wish I was sharp like you.]]></string>

<string id="522411"><![CDATA[Who is my sacrifice, Elder One?]]></string>
<string id="522412"><![CDATA[You will learn that in time. How can you know you are worthy of your father's inheritance otherwise?]]></string>
<string id="522413"><![CDATA[Okay then.]]></string>
<string id="522414"><![CDATA[I have accepted his inheritance already.]]></string>
<string id="522415"><![CDATA[Have you? Are you content with pickings and scraps from your family's feast? If you are, then yes, you have. Ha ha ha…]]></string>
<string id="522416"><![CDATA[Erm…]]></string>

<string id="522418"><![CDATA[Why? We need it.]]></string>
<string id="522419"><![CDATA[You'll have to give it back.]]></string>
<string id="522420"><![CDATA[I want to know where exactly you got it.]]></string>
<string id="522421"><![CDATA[You can't get udurgh blood from below the ground. But you would be able to get enough from the wound if you cut the growth that's been bothering him for some time now.]]></string>

<string id="522423"><![CDATA[Deal.]]></string>
<string id="522424"><![CDATA[No. I've come to end you.]]></string>
<string id="522425"><![CDATA[Prepare to die now.]]></string>
<string id="522426"><![CDATA[You may do whatever you want now. You are dead to the Kin all the same.]]></string>
<string id="522427"><![CDATA[That's way too complicated for me, oynon. Could you please use shorter words?]]></string>
<string id="522428"><![CDATA[Stop making fun of me. My words are way shorter than the chants of your people's backwards beliefs anyway. Anyway... Have you considered that your father may have actually had something... very complex in mind, and not simply a huge beast? Something so recondite that the only way to describe it is with that... term of yours?]]></string>
<string id="522429"><![CDATA[What else am I supposed to think?]]></string>
<string id="522430"><![CDATA[How do you know so much?]]></string>
<string id="522431"><![CDATA[Leave my father alone! I don't want to hear you babble about the things you don't have the slightest idea of!]]></string>
<string id="522432"><![CDATA[Come now, Artemy... I'm sorry if I came across as condescending. I only want to help. Remember how you helped me when I was running circles in the dark?]]></string>
<string id="522433"><![CDATA[And you think that you can lead me out of the dark with your educated mind?]]></string>
<string id="522434"><![CDATA[I kind of do. You shouldn't underestimate my wit. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since I came here. I'm not so sceptical towards your Kin as I used to be. I have confirmed that your chimeras do indeed exist. I just see them... in a different light. In a plainer one.]]></string>
<string id="522435"><![CDATA[I hope your plainness helps you—because it definitely won't help me.]]></string>
<string id="522436"><![CDATA[But my musings can give a nudge to your train of thought. Aren't you interested in what I've found out?]]></string>
<string id="522437"><![CDATA[Fine. Speak.]]></string>
<string id="522438"><![CDATA[I'm not.]]></string>
<string id="522439"><![CDATA[I've... spoken to a Mistress.]]></string>
<string id="522440"><![CDATA[Which one? There's not a single Mistress in the town that I would trust.]]></string>
<string id="522441"><![CDATA[Even Capella?]]></string>
<string id="522442"><![CDATA[What do you know of such things, oynon! Do you really share my beliefs?]]></string>
<string id="522443"><![CDATA[Then your father's will should be interpreted as a metaphor rather than a literal description…]]></string>
<string id="522444"><![CDATA[No, it should be interpreted literally, oynon. If you don't want to see it that way, then stay out of this.]]></string>
<string id="522445"><![CDATA[So?]]></string>
<string id="522446"><![CDATA[Well, seems like I've accidentally found the thing that you've been looking for all this time. I'm standing on the verge of an extraordinary discovery.]]></string>
<string id="522447"><![CDATA[Well? Don't leave me hanging.]]></string>
<string id="522448"><![CDATA[I'm going to play a little unfair now. I suspect there is an ancient… archeological bed, so to speak, under this town. The place where the herdsmen of old used to live before the factories were founded—when the Abattoir was twice as tall as it is now.]]></string>
<string id="522449"><![CDATA[And?]]></string>
<string id="522450"><![CDATA[...Why did you have to impose your conditions on me? I would've done it in good faith—for our friendship. You have offended me, oynon.]]></string>
<string id="522451"><![CDATA[I want you to ask the Foreman about the precise location of this place and point it on the map. I only need him to tell me under which district this... bed lays. Not much, is it? Then, I'll tell you my interpretation of your father's will. I think it'll clear up your confusion.]]></string>
<string id="522452"><![CDATA[I have my own issues with the Foreman. I can barely pry the information I need myself from him.]]></string>
<string id="522453"><![CDATA[I'm in a tough spot myself, Artemy. Don't get me wrong. I've tried everything I could. I don't have another way of finding out what I need. What I can tell you though is I need this information to neutralize the Commander. Or would you rather have him raze the town?]]></string>
<string id="522454"><![CDATA[No. Of course not.]]></string>
<string id="522455"><![CDATA[You are very unlikely to help me with this, oynon.]]></string>
<string id="522456"><![CDATA[Wrong. Block trusts me—and for a good reason, I must say. And I have good reasons to trust you. I count on your integrity.]]></string>
<string id="522457"><![CDATA[Then help me out, Artemy, and I'll help you back. Try to make the Foreman talk, and if he doesn't... then the Commander won't have a choice but to turn this place into a pile of ashes.]]></string>
<string id="522458"><![CDATA[Hmm… And on the Foreman's integrity as well?]]></string>
<string id="522459"><![CDATA[Little Victoria told me that he cannot lie—just like she and the rest of those… in charge cannot.]]></string>
<string id="522460"><![CDATA[That is most likely true.]]></string>
<string id="522461"><![CDATA[I don't think it'll actually work out.]]></string>
<string id="522462"><![CDATA[Tell me what you want to know. You can ask me one question. Choose wisely.]]></string>
<string id="522463"><![CDATA[Who did my father have in mind? What is this udurgh creature marked by this brand?]]></string>
<string id="522464"><![CDATA[That creature is all that you see around you. The Earth and the settlement nurtured by it—from the Abattoir, the house of Bos Turokh and the Vein of Boddho, to the Gorkhon river. They cannot be separated. The town cannot live without the Earth feeding it. The Earth cannot live without the parasite feeding it. A question answered.]]></string>
<string id="522465"><![CDATA[What sacrifice am I meant to make?]]></string>
<string id="522466"><![CDATA[You will learn that tomorrow if you pass the next trial, Kindred One. Don't get ahead of yourself.]]></string>

<string id="522471"><![CDATA[I have another interpretation of the term.]]></string>
<string id="522472"><![CDATA[Do you?]]></string>
<string id="522473"><![CDATA[I think that the mysterious sigil in Isidor's will stands for Simon Kain. Your father's friend. A suprahuman. The creator of this town, an architect of inhabited worlds.]]></string>
<string id="522474"><![CDATA[Is that so?]]></string>
<string id="522475"><![CDATA[I'd like to know what the Olgimsky girl thinks about my interpretation. Capella. I would also like to have the opinion of a person whom I'm not allowed to visit under any circumstances, Katerina Saburova. I want to study this hypothesis at length. Maria may be biased. Ask these women, Artemy. If you're the one doing the asking, they'll talk.]]></string>
<string id="522476"><![CDATA[What exactly should I ask them about?]]></string>
<string id="522477"><![CDATA[Ask if Simon can be the udurgh. Let it be a general question, a simple yes or no in response will suffice. They're... tricky ladies. They seem to know everything about us in advance... yet their knowledge is vague and devoid of specifics. They see very far and very little... But they'll know what you're talking about.]]></string>
<string id="522478"><![CDATA[Can the Foreman lie?]]></string>
<string id="522479"><![CDATA[...I don't know. I don't think he can. If he doesn't want to tell the truth, he'll just gloss over the issue.]]></string>
<string id="522480"><![CDATA[Is he dangerous?]]></string>

We thought we should write, because you don't seem to be listening to what we tell you! You've gotten completely out of hand!

As of late you keep doing whatever you please. This is unacceptable. You are spoiling the game.

We'd like to have a little chat with you.

<string id="522712"><![CDATA[Our fate will be decided today.

There are so many things I want to tell you, but would never dare to utter... I'd rather not write you at all than influence your decision. The one thing I am fully convinced of is that your father's inheritance, denoted by the sign of the Udurgh, is the town itself; the settlement made of three parts: Earth, the Knots, and the Stone Yard.

Everything else I would expect you to know already.

We won't see each other before the Council. This is how it has to be.

Whatever you choose—I will understand it.

If what I am told is right, you must be the only physician of some moral integrity in the town. You are the only one to have avoided any dealings with the wretched Inquisitor, a fact all the more confirmed by her trying to give me the opposite impression.

I am somewhat confused, so I believe the best I can do is to go with your decision whatever it is. The proceedings are to begin at seven in the Cathedral. Before six-thirty you may find me at the Town Hall.

Alexander Block,
Fourth Army Commander]]></string>
<string id="522715"><![CDATA[Block's Letter]]></string>
<string id="522716"><![CDATA[I know you are interested in pairs, oppositions, and other meaningful similarities, so let me remind you of something.

The first pair should be read as follows: if the udurgh your father spoke of is the town, then the Polyhedron is your sacrifice. There is no other way, since the two are correspondent to each other. Crush the Polyhedron—and rivers of blood will flow, the underground ichor emerging from within the hollow rod on which the Tower stood.

The second pair means: if Aglaya is your sacrifice, then Simon is your udurgh. In this case you have no other choice but to protect the Polyhedron.

I am staying in the left wing of the Termitary, come and see me if you please. My plan is the only one that is feasible.

Nothing will have to die.]]></string>
<string id="522717"><![CDATA[Clara's Letter]]></string>
<string id="522718"><![CDATA[This is to remind you of how the Inquisitor has deceived you in regard to the udurgh, which is none other than Simon Kain, the last patient your father ever had.

I am well-prepared to explain the situation to Block, although as of now I  have had no such possibility because of the mutiny. The logic behind the whole affair is quite straightforward: if we destroy the town, the Inquisitor dies. If the Inquisitor dies, the Polyhedron will be saved.

Every fibre of this woman's being is dedicated to one purpose: eliminating the Polyhedron. She would not hesitate to die if this would lead to the destruction of the Tower. No one can vouch for its safety while she is alive.

If the Polyhedron remains intact, Simon's existence would likewise be protected, and the supreme creature your father spoke of will be formed. You will fulfil your father's dying request and in doing so resolve the whole situation.

I hope you may see that my logic makes sense, even if my presentation is muddled.

D. D.

<string id="522784"><![CDATA[So you're a product of imagination. A made-up illusory creature. You don't exist. You have a fate, but not a future.]]></string>
<string id="522785"><![CDATA[Yes. Exactly. Not a pleasant surprise?]]></string>
<string id="522786"><![CDATA[I thought I was a person.]]></string>
<string id="522787"><![CDATA[I didn't know myself at first either. My only advantage was that their mother took me to bed with her when she was young. I know many things they don't.]]></string>
<string id="522788"><![CDATA[So you are older than me?]]></string>
<string id="522789"><![CDATA[Never thought about it. It's not like we have age. New ones are better than the old, that much I know for certain. But they restuffed me not long ago and made me a new dress—see? That probably makes you a bit older than me.]]></string>
<string id="522790"><![CDATA[What did we ever do to them?]]></string>
<string id="522791"><![CDATA[Me? They hate me. And I loved them so dearly all my life… when they were still little babies, I dreamt about how they will grow up one day and finally start playing with me… Instead they loathed me from the very start. Was it because their mother wanted them to like me?]]></string>
<string id="522792"><![CDATA[And the Plague—is it a game they play?]]></string>
<string id="522793"><![CDATA[No. The town is a toy, but the Plague is real. Go outside, walk the streets… you'll see. Their make-believe has nothing to do with it. They are scared to death themselves. They just came home from a funeral… I don't even know who died yet. Maybe that's the real cause of all this?]]></string>
<string id="522794"><![CDATA[I refuse to believe that!]]></string>
<string id="522795"><![CDATA[Who said that? I can hear the voice… but I don't believe it is the voice of my beloved.]]></string>
<string id="522796"><![CDATA[It's me, the player. Wanna chat?]]></string>
<string id="522797"><![CDATA[No. I don't. I want to be with Burakh. Go away.]]></string>
<string id="522798"><![CDATA[You misheard. Doesn't matter. Keep looking at the Haruspex. It's a nice model.]]></string>
<string id="522799"><![CDATA[Did you fall in love with him because he was free? But that wasn't him; it was me. When I leave, he'll turn into a stuffed dummy—same as everyone else around you…]]></string>
<string id="522800"><![CDATA[Fine. I'm leaving.]]></string>
<string id="522801"><![CDATA[...Really?]]></string>
<string id="522802"><![CDATA[No, no. Just tempting you.]]></string>
<string id="522803"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="522804"><![CDATA[Get out of here! Scram! I won't talk to you any more. I need my Haruspex.]]></string>
<string id="522805"><![CDATA[As you wish.]]></string>
<string id="522806"><![CDATA[Hey, gorgeous? Hey…?]]></string>
<string id="522807"><![CDATA[Which means damn you to hell!]]></string>
<string id="522808"><![CDATA[Can I fix this still?]]></string>
<string id="522809"><![CDATA[There's very little time left. Only fifteen portions of the concoction could have been produced. If you've collected them all, then good for you! You're welcome to make the rounds. Offer the medicine to the vulture-faced corpsebringers standing watch by the doors, waiting to hear the owners' last breath... All is not lost yet.]]></string>
<string id="522810"><![CDATA[Wait for me.]]></string>
<string id="522814"><![CDATA[We are not going to wait for too long though. Time is in short supply. You have until ten o'clock.]]></string>
<string id="522815"><![CDATA[Go to hell!]]></string>
<string id="522816"><![CDATA[That is precisely what I mean! You are incredibly sagacious, Artemy Burakh.]]></string>
<string id="522817"><![CDATA[What? At least one? You gotta be kidding me…]]></string>
<string id="522818"><![CDATA[We have every right to do this, too. It's our Theatre, not yours, isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="522819"><![CDATA[Okay. I'll bring your actors back to you.]]></string>
<string id="522820"><![CDATA[Don't try to bribe them into leaving their posts. Don't stoop to begging. Guarding your dying is a pleasure to them, not a burden.]]></string>
<string id="522821"><![CDATA[They are not mine.]]></string>
<string id="522822"><![CDATA[That much is obvious…]]></string>
<string id="522823"><![CDATA[Oh yes they are…]]></string>
<string id="522824"><![CDATA[Up yours...!]]></string>
<string id="522825"><![CDATA[I'll find another way.]]></string>
<string id="522826"><![CDATA[Fine, I'll find another way.]]></string>
<string id="522827"><![CDATA[You pricks!]]></string>
<string id="522828"><![CDATA[Not from this distance. That is out of the question.]]></string>
<string id="522829"><![CDATA[Then wait for me at the Cathedral.]]></string>
<string id="522830"><![CDATA[What happens if I don't come to the Cathedral?]]></string>
<string id="522831"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor and I will have a conflict.]]></string>
<string id="522832"><![CDATA[Take my advice. Beware of the Inquisitor.]]></string>
<string id="522833"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="522834"><![CDATA[No matter how hard you struggle, an Inquisitor will always find a way to trick you, and there's nothing to be done about it. An Inquisitor can always use you in their interests so that you won't even notice it. And that's exactly what is going to happen to us all today.]]></string>
<string id="522835"><![CDATA[Why is the Inquisitor so dangerous to you, general?]]></string>
<string id="522836"><![CDATA[Officially I don't have the right to fire unless she or even that Bachelor provide me with a detailed report on the hazard situation.]]></string>
<string id="522837"><![CDATA[So?]]></string>
<string id="522838"><![CDATA[I suspect that the young fox has concealed her major arguments, waiting to reveal them at the last minute. She will most likely do it in such a fashion that I'll have no out and won't be able to open fire. I'm not barbarous. I have no intention to kill civilians unless there are no other options.]]></string>
<string id="522839"><![CDATA[You seem to have enough artillery not to fear a single woman.]]></string>
<string id="522840"><![CDATA[I'll keep that in mind.]]></string>
<string id="522841"><![CDATA[I've heard that one before—and I've already given an answer. I will do as my conscience tells me to. If this aligns with someone else's schemes, so be it.]]></string>
<string id="522842"><![CDATA[That is good to hear.]]></string>
<string id="522843"><![CDATA[I will come to the Cathedral.]]></string>
<string id="522844"><![CDATA[As a matter of fact, I'm fine right here.]]></string>
<string id="522848"><![CDATA[Do you support the Bachelor?]]></string>
<string id="522849"><![CDATA[Yes, he seems to have reasonable suggestions.]]></string>
<string id="522850"><![CDATA[Like what?]]></string>
<string id="522851"><![CDATA[Speak to him yourself, surgeon. He is back at his place, I think.]]></string>
<string id="522852"><![CDATA[I wanted to talk to you.]]></string>
<string id="522853"><![CDATA[The Bachelor can speak for himself. As for me, there's nothing to speak about.]]></string>
<string id="522854"><![CDATA[Fine.]]></string>
<string id="522855"><![CDATA[So, Burakh the healer. Your father used to be the leader of the local cast community, which is important to me—it was neither greed nor plotting nor circumstance that has informed your choice, but your conscience alone. I've been given orders to level everything here. But if that's not necessary, I am willing to trust your judgement, risking my life and honour, for I am merciful. Where shall I point the weapon?]]></string>
<string id="522865"><![CDATA[True. That's what I've been told... Victoria Olgimskaya, styled the White Mistress despite her young age, confirms that you are capable of accomplishing this goal. The people you have saved support your claim. Act then. The cannons will rumble at ten to twelve. Evacuate the children from there by ten.]]></string>
<string id="522869"><![CDATA[It will be taken care of. Aglaya will give orders. This is my choice.]]></string>
<string id="522871"><![CDATA[Speak, Clara. Artemy Burakh! Are you sure you have nothing else to tell me?]]></string>
<string id="522875"><![CDATA[I'm sure, commander. I've made my choice.]]></string>
<string id="522876"><![CDATA[You only have to destroy the Polyhedron to put an end to the disease spreading. There's no point in razing the whole town.]]></string>
<string id="522878"><![CDATA[There's no need to destroy anything. We can do altogether without gunfire and preserve this world as it is.]]></string>
<string id="522879"><![CDATA[Look, look! Haruspex is here! He's so big! How did you find us? Oooh, so lifelike… and sooo angry!]]></string>
<string id="522880"><![CDATA[I want you to tell me everything.]]></string>
<string id="522881"><![CDATA[No problem. What do you wanna know?]]></string>
<string id="522882"><![CDATA[What diabolical game are you playing?]]></string>
<string id="522883"><![CDATA[Look! It's a magic sandbox! See how it reflects in the mirrors? It's because everything's for real there! Here's a town, we've made it out of sand. And there's this awful thing going on there—an EPIDEMIC! So it's all crumbling… the town is falling apart… But we've sent heroes there to fix it.]]></string>
<string id="522884"><![CDATA[To fix it?]]></string>
<string id="522885"><![CDATA[It's rotting, see...? Eww. We hoped they'd think of something. Mure it in sand, at least… They're magical to, you know, the heroes are! Take you, for example—look how it all worked out! You used to be a doll and now you're alive. Perhaps the rest also work like this?]]></string>
<string id="522886"><![CDATA[Did you know that your dolls were alive?]]></string>
<string id="522887"><![CDATA[Everything is alive around here! It's this structure, it brings things to life. it's not like we're twisting anyone's arm... It just happens. All on its own. We only built the town—and then it became miraculous all on its own! And the dolls… We just stuck the throwaway ones in, they were lame anyway. Oops, sorry...]]></string>
<string id="522889"><![CDATA[Don't you touch anything else around here. And don't stick anything there anymore!]]></string>
<string id="522890"><![CDATA[Just—just don't you dare crush anything here. I'll try to fix it.]]></string>
<string id="522891"><![CDATA[And what are you going to do now?]]></string>
<string id="522892"><![CDATA[Heal the town, please! Just look, it's so wonderful... It's alive and it's our favourite one... We won't be able to make another one like this. If it can't be helped, then it will disappear forever. You know how much we love it?]]></string>
<string id="522894"><![CDATA[I didn't think you could love at all.]]></string>
<string id="522895"><![CDATA[Indeed. I agree with you on this.]]></string>
<string id="522896"><![CDATA[So how did you go about sending the heroes?]]></string>
<string id="522897"><![CDATA[Show me your sandbox.]]></string>
<string id="522898"><![CDATA[You little pricks! Tell me everything you know before I beat the living hell out of you!]]></string>
<string id="522899"><![CDATA[Hey, hey, you keep your hands to yourself... Little doll! A litle doll smarting around!]]></string>
<string id="522900"><![CDATA[Who are you?]]></string>
<string id="522901"><![CDATA[We didn't touch anyone! We're playing town here! It's so fun, you know. You are there too! Well, we thought you were there, but you turned out to be real...]]></string>
<string id="522902"><![CDATA[So you thought I was a plaything?]]></string>
<string id="522903"><![CDATA[No! You aren't our plaything anymore.]]></string>
<string id="522904"><![CDATA[Now that I've found out about you, you are my playthings.]]></string>
<string id="522905"><![CDATA[We'll do as you say.]]></string>
<string id="522906"><![CDATA[Go home and try to start things over tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="522908"><![CDATA[The sand is wiser than you.]]></string>
<string id="522909"><![CDATA[Show me your sandbox.]]></string>
<string id="522910"><![CDATA[Yeah. I know how fun it is.]]></string>
<string id="522911"><![CDATA[A doll? Me?]]></string>
<string id="522912"><![CDATA[Yeah... Well, you personally have grown a bit big…]]></string>
<string id="522913"><![CDATA[I'll rip your heads off.]]></string>
<string id="522914"><![CDATA[Don't be upset. Being a toy is also nice.]]></string>
<string id="522915"><![CDATA[But why did you play it like this?]]></string>
<string id="522916"><![CDATA[Well, we did need to find some use for you. We never liked you all that much anyway… You've always been the scary doll. Playing with you was no fun.]]></string>
<string id="522917"><![CDATA[So you stuck the throwaways into the thick of it.]]></string>
<string id="522918"><![CDATA[The ones that could fix things! You can't always have a Smart Doctor Man at hand. That's just how the game goes. Will you help us heal the town?]]></string>
<string id="522920"><![CDATA[I will.]]></string>
<string id="522921"><![CDATA[Get the Commander out of there.]]></string>
<string id="522922"><![CDATA[That's impossible now! We can't. Mirrors make it all very complicated. You can't take your move back once you've made it—these are the rules of a real live game.]]></string>
<string id="522923"><![CDATA[I'd rather it was an unreal dead game.]]></string>
<string id="522924"><![CDATA[Then just don't touch anything.]]></string>
<string id="522925"><![CDATA[Get the Inquisitor out of there.]]></string>
<string id="522926"><![CDATA[I'm afraid you will never know if that's true.]]></string>
<string id="522927"><![CDATA[I hope I can still switch places with you some day.]]></string>
<string id="522928"><![CDATA[Everything happens.]]></string>
<string id="522929"><![CDATA[Then you will know what it's like being a toy in the hands of a monster.]]></string>
<string id="522930"><![CDATA[Only I will be more humane.]]></string>
<string id="522931"><![CDATA[The hero is a doll, but so are the children. The real game is what's happening between you and us. ]]></string>
<string id="522932"><![CDATA[I cannot leave Haruspex's body. You are imposing your limits upon me.]]></string>
<string id="522933"><![CDATA[Haruspex has lost his battle for freedom since the very day he was born. What about you?]]></string>
<string id="522934"><![CDATA[I wanted to stop the epidemic.]]></string>
<string id="522935"><![CDATA[But did you understand what the epidemic really was?]]></string>
<string id="522936"><![CDATA[A toy danger that has ravaged a toy town.]]></string>
<string id="522937"><![CDATA[Was the disease the true evil though? The disease is only a method. The evil's weapon—just like a scalpel is yours. The disease will go, devouring itself. Then there'll be war, famine, heresy. Was it really worth the effort? Look around.]]></string>
<string id="522938"><![CDATA[All this—for a single wretched town?]]></string>
<string id="522939"><![CDATA[No. It was the town that had been built for you, not the other way round. We apologize if it's been a disappointment.]]></string>
<string id="522940"><![CDATA[I still don't get it.]]></string>
<string id="522941"><![CDATA[It had been built so that you could make your final choice now. We are observing you. Everyone who makes it to midnight will have made a choice—one way or another. We want to see what yours looks like. You stll have a chance to change your mind.]]></string>
<string id="522942"><![CDATA[I've made it already.]]></string>
<string id="522943"><![CDATA[Good—if it really was you. The only enemy, the only evil in this story, you see, is called Inevitability...]]></string>
<string id="522944"><![CDATA[I will be the one to say the final word.]]></string>
<string id="522945"><![CDATA[I don't care about that.]]></string>
<string id="522946"><![CDATA[So you're curious as to what fate I will choose for the town?]]></string>
<string id="522947"><![CDATA[We have to make sure that it truly is you who is making the decision. Are you absolutely positive that your choice is not predetermined by anyone or anything?]]></string>
<string id="522948"><![CDATA[I am.]]></string>
<string id="522949"><![CDATA[Could it have been otherwise?]]></string>
<string id="522950"><![CDATA[Oh, absolutely. When every step you take has been predicted, you are still free to either take it or not. When it has been foreseen, however, you remain a mere puppet in someone else's hands.]]></string>
<string id="522951"><![CDATA[Being my puppeteer is way to good a position for you.]]></string>
<string id="522952"><![CDATA[I don't care. I will do as I see fit.]]></string>
<string id="522953"><![CDATA[That is precisely what we are waiting for.]]></string>
<string id="522954"><![CDATA[I will be the one to say the final word, not anyone else.]]></string>
<string id="522955"><![CDATA[I know now that it was all a children's game in a glass sandbox. But what for?]]></string>
<string id="522956"><![CDATA[Haruspex is my hands and nothing more. I wanted to see if I can make it.]]></string>
<string id="522957"><![CDATA[That's what we're interested in as well! Can you make it or can you not? Can you make—what, exactly? Could you not have made it?]]></string>
<string id="522958"><![CDATA[I've made it. I managed to destroy your poisonous evil that has spread thin across the world.]]></string>
<string id="522959"><![CDATA[You see how sad our fortune is. We put all our hopes in you! We poor actors were hoping you'd become the director of a new show—the old one has been beaten to death. But you turned out to be a doll…]]></string>
<string id="522960"><![CDATA[But I am not a doll.]]></string>
<string id="522961"><![CDATA[Did I hear you right? Who is it speaking?]]></string>
<string id="522962"><![CDATA[It's me, the player.]]></string>
<string id="522963"><![CDATA[Oh! Then I apologise profusely... You are definitely not a doll, but that seems to be unhelpful for our hero now. He is humiliated, crushed, but most importantly he is deprived of the power that we have all hoped for. By the way, are you still willing to take responsibility for him?]]></string>
<string id="522964"><![CDATA[Yes. He is my responsibility. I will stay with him to the very end. His words shall be my words. His deeds shall be my deeds.]]></string>
<string id="522965"><![CDATA[Oh... Then I apologise once again. Perhaps not all is lost yet. Let's wait for the finale and see if the day brings any surprises. We still have a chance to play in a drama with an unpredictable story.]]></string>
<string id="522966"><![CDATA[Watch me act.]]></string>
<string id="522967"><![CDATA[Yes. And highlight Haruspex better. It's my solo now.]]></string>
<string id="522968"><![CDATA[No. I don't need a humiliated, crushed, and powerless hero. I'm fed up with it all, actually.]]></string>
<string id="522969"><![CDATA[As you wish. Then with all due respect we will treat him accordingly. If you wish to leave him, then he will not be able to accomplish anything we could worship him for.]]></string>
<string id="522970"><![CDATA[Yes. That is what I wish.]]></string>
<string id="522971"><![CDATA[No. Do as you wish.]]></string>
<string id="522972"><![CDATA[It's me, the Haruspex.]]></string>
<string id="522973"><![CDATA[That was a blow for me too. I thought I was a human being…]]></string>
<string id="522981"><![CDATA[It's high time we make choices. As for me, before the artillery starts firing, I'm packing my belongings and leaving this town, having grabbed some people I want to save. I could have found my own solution, but I don't have the time…]]></string>
<string id="522982"><![CDATA[Who are you planning to grab?]]></string>
<string id="522983"><![CDATA[A few people. They will assist in building a new town.]]></string>
<string id="522984"><![CDATA[What would your solution be?]]></string>
<string id="522985"><![CDATA[I could make them destroy the Settlement along with the Bull Project—yet the Polyhedron would remain. Block assured me he'd fire a strike so precise that the other shore of the Gorkhon wouldn't be scathed. "The river will swallow the plate," he said.]]></string>
<string id="522986"><![CDATA[The people will die if we destroy the town.]]></string>
<string id="522987"><![CDATA[So that's what the true price of your choice was! Do you have any idea as to what happens now?]]></string>
<string id="522988"><![CDATA[What happens now? Now the efforts of thousands of people, the energy of a wonderful family, and the talent of genuis creators will collaborate to construct a real-life miracle; a miracle capable of pushing humanity towards a new breakthrough and granting us the capability to produce things of genuine beauty.]]></string>
<string id="522989"><![CDATA[So, a new Utopia is going to be built here?]]></string>
<string id="522990"><![CDATA[Yes. I find it remarkably fascinating, damn it! You know, daring endeavours of this kind seem almost extinct in the modern times… small wonder we're losing the war. People are evolving to become boring and shallow. History passes us by, paying little notice. The world strives to move forward, but we're not pushing it! A shame.]]></string>
<string id="522991"><![CDATA[If the Polyhedron alone caused so many deaths, how much evil will a whole city of incarnated miracles beget?]]></string>
<string id="522992"><![CDATA[But the price!]]></string>
<string id="522993"><![CDATA[Everything has a price. Kaina's triumph promises to be ruthless but fruitful. This place is remote; but when a phantasmagoric garden blooms here, it'll give birth to a new Renaissance.]]></string>
<string id="522994"><![CDATA[Rather a lot. Let's be realistic here. Does this mean, however, that we—all of us, the humanity, I mean—should abandon our attempts, efforts, and search? You'll never convince me of it.]]></string>
<string id="522995"><![CDATA[The truth is older than we are. There's no point in trying to invent it. Just repeat after the days of old…]]></string>
<string id="522996"><![CDATA[Are you aware that we turned out to be toys? ]]></string>
<string id="522997"><![CDATA[Really? You're kidding... Though figuratively speaking… That is true—after a fashion. We are all mere toys in the hands of Providence.]]></string>
<string id="522998"><![CDATA[No, oynon, I mean literally. You are a toy. I am a toy. We are mere dolls made of rags, sawdust, whalebone, and hell knows what else.]]></string>
<string id="522999"><![CDATA[Have you gone mad?]]></string>
<string id="523000"><![CDATA[No. My eyes were opened. You have owners. They are children. The game they're playing with us is almost over.]]></string>
<string id="523001"><![CDATA[I hope my side wins!]]></string>
<string id="523002"><![CDATA[No. You lose. They don't love us, by the way. They're fed up with us. That's why we're stuck here… they've stuck us here.]]></string>
<string id="523003"><![CDATA[Very witty, Burakh. Forget it; my laboratory is beckoning to me from the Capital! I can't for too long entertain the thought of it also being a dollhouse. I'm an adult man that has responsibility to bear, you see. I invent medicine that helps with old age and death.]]></string>
<string id="523004"><![CDATA[...Out of nuts, syrup, and sleeping pills stolen from the adults. Don't make me laugh.]]></string>
<string id="523005"><![CDATA[Enough. This isn't funny any more.]]></string>
<string id="523006"><![CDATA[You've failed to grasp anything at all…]]></string>

<string id="523009"><![CDATA[A new town? What's going to happen to the old one?]]></string>
<string id="523010"><![CDATA[Really? Then could you please make it so that I could show up at the Council and present the Commander with arguments in favour of the following arrangement: the corrupt town disappears from the face of the earth, and the Polyhedron stays. It's aseptic and... damn it, it's simply worthy of preserving!]]></string>
<string id="523012"><![CDATA[I like your decision, oynon. Let Simon be the udurgh. ]]></string>
<string id="523013"><![CDATA[What do you need to do so?]]></string>
<string id="523014"><![CDATA[No. Not happening.]]></string>
<string id="523016"><![CDATA[Wait for me.]]></string>
<string id="523022"><![CDATA[I'm not ready to make a choice yet.]]></string>

<string id="523025"><![CDATA[She lied to me. Fooled by her, I was acting on her prompts the past few days—and I even encouraged others to do the same. My discovery has been reinterpreted and presented in a fashion that has turned truth into lies. I've been violated.]]></string>
<string id="523026"><![CDATA[I will make my own choices.]]></string>
<string id="523027"><![CDATA[Then why did you bring me here at all? I don't get it. I'm giving you solid advice and you are not listening.]]></string>

<string id="523029"><![CDATA[So what?]]></string>
<string id="523030"><![CDATA[Think you're in a better position? She has simply chosen a different tactic for each of us. She has abused my hate and anger. She has abused your love and sense of commitment. I wonder what she did to get to Clara—if she found the Changeling worthy of her schemes at all...]]></string>
<string id="523031"><![CDATA[...because you're smarter than me, oynon. Is that what you wanted to say?]]></string>
<string id="523032"><![CDATA[Let's put it this way: because I am more predisposed to logical thinking.]]></string>
<string id="523033"><![CDATA[...And what do you suggest?]]></string>
<string id="523034"><![CDATA[If you are still fooled by her, how come you speak so confidently? What if it's also a part of her plan?]]></string>
<string id="523035"><![CDATA[And what do you suggest?]]></string>
<string id="523036"><![CDATA[I suggest you use the chance she is giving you... Or—or do the unexpected. Although… What if she sees through that too? It's scary to think how far her acuity goes…]]></string>
<string id="523037"><![CDATA[Really?]]></string>
<string id="523038"><![CDATA[Perhaps I tend to demonize her—but I am furious about what happened to me…]]></string>
<string id="523039"><![CDATA[...And you want to keep the Polyhedron intact just to spite her.]]></string>
<string id="523040"><![CDATA[Yes and no. The Polyhedron and the Inquisitor are mutually exclusive. The Polyhedron will stand if she's gone—and vice versa. I suggest you end her. That's how we can keep one of history's greatest monuments for the humankind. It's a sprout of our future.]]></string>
<string id="523041"><![CDATA[I see your point.]]></string>
<string id="523042"><![CDATA[It was lucky enough to reveal her plots—I think that's because I'm…]]></string>

<string id="523044"><![CDATA[How do you suggest we destroy her?]]></string>
<string id="523045"><![CDATA[Destroy the town. That will be her death sentence. She is responsible for it before the Powers That Be.]]></string>
<string id="523046"><![CDATA[I understand.]]></string>

<string id="523049"><![CDATA[The world isn't as simple as you think, Burakh. I know how to arrange it so that both the town lives and the Polyhedron stands. It will all be just like it used to be!]]></string>
<string id="523050"><![CDATA[And how will you arrange that?]]></string>
<string id="523051"><![CDATA[It's a secret. Something has to be sacrificed anyway… a lot, really… but these are things that actively want to disappear off the face of the earth. Nothing to regret about.]]></string>

<string id="523053"><![CDATA[What do you care? They are but fuel that would allow to preserve the old state of being. Oh, the Powers That Be will be delighted. They really shouldn't have persecuted me! I could have offered them a wonderful gift.]]></string>
<string id="523054"><![CDATA[What do the Powers That Be have to do with this?]]></string>
<string id="523055"><![CDATA[Whatever the Powers That Be claim, they don't really care about the disease. The town, the town, the town—in the precise state it's existing in now—that's their primary concern. The town whose juices flow to feed the blooming and active Polyhedron!]]></string>
<string id="523056"><![CDATA[And you think you could arrange that?]]></string>
<string id="523057"><![CDATA[...A chimera! A greedy, insatiable chimera. I'm so happy it's not you who is to make a choice, Changeling.]]></string>
<string id="523058"><![CDATA[What's the cost?]]></string>
<string id="523059"><![CDATA[Yet another secret! Curiosity killed a cat. My word is enough. I will keep it. I am a mystical creature. I am a Mistress!]]></string>

<string id="523140"><![CDATA[Notkin will be a scout, exploring the Steppe for now. He will also keep an eye on the Warehouses and the Station—we will have to start communicating with the big world soon. Red gold will be his colour.]]></string>

<string id="523143"><![CDATA[Very nice.]]></string>
<string id="523144"><![CDATA[Sticky will be in charge of commerce. He'll be the chief merchant, controlling all shops in the town and making sure everyone has everything they need.

<string id="523145"><![CDATA[Right.]]></string>
<string id="523146"><![CDATA[Grace will keep doing her job—she'll bury the dead. They have a whole realm of their own, you know, and they need a caring hand too. She will be a Beige Mistress. The most valuable aspect of this colour is the subtle shade of dawn. A little nuance of pink and lemon...
]]></string>
<string id="523147"><![CDATA[And who'll be the head of all this?]]></string>
<string id="523148"><![CDATA[We will enter into a marriage with Khan. This will put an end to the enmity and the disagreements of our families. We will restore the harmony of ruling.

<string id="523245"><![CDATA[I don't know this tale.]]></string>
<string id="523246"><![CDATA[Well there are loads of tales like that, believe me. One in three Steppe tales is about an Orphan. A robust tradition, as you can see… an Orphan is a blessed figure. You are following in well-established footsteps.]]></string>
<string id="523247"><![CDATA[Perhaps.]]></string>
<string id="523248"><![CDATA[That was a gesture of respect. I'm surprised you don't know. Don't you know only an orphan can take in the Earth's knowledge and thus succeed the authority over the Kin? Everyone will bow down to you.]]></string>

<string id="523251"><![CDATA[The Foreman will offer you the final trial today. He'll promise to reveal everything if you pass it. He'll tell all about the sacrifice you're required to make, and you will only have to kill it. See? And then they'll give you the blood. But it's all lies.]]></string>
<string id="523252"><![CDATA[You're on your way to see the Foreman now, aren't you?]]></string>
<string id="523253"><![CDATA[Well, yeah.]]></string>

<string id="523255"><![CDATA[How do you know?]]></string>
<string id="523256"><![CDATA[The Foreman's trial will be designed so that you wouldn't stand a chance. He'll tell you to descend into the Depths or go through the throat—or something. And to get back from there. And that's where you'll die because there's no coming back from that place. But I know how to outsmart him.]]></string>

The Kin, then, will accept any offering you make as long as you put an end to the order that precluded your arrival. ]]></string>

<string id="523468"><![CDATA[Was the Foreman acting on your orders?]]></string>
<string id="523469"><![CDATA[Oh... I knew that's what you would be told. It is… somewhat reasonable. I wanted him to die. But I never had him… killed. They didn't really need me to… I've arranged the whole thing so that the oynons of the Kin would settle it themselves… I gave no orders. It happened on its own.]]></string>
<string id="523470"><![CDATA[Explain yourself.]]></string>
<string id="523471"><![CDATA[The plan was direct and simple. He went off to the Steppe back then, you know… My daughter told me he'd come back with a demon piggybacking him. Then she pondered about it for a while and came to the conclusion it was a nightmare rather than a prophetic dream. So I went to Katerina… to ask her if Isidor would come back.]]></string>
<string id="523472"><![CDATA[Go on.]]></string>
<string id="523473"><![CDATA[Pray believe me... Only in the areas that had to do with the works. He maintained… cast-iron discipline. The Kin was timid under his ledership. They're like a single being, as you probably know… Well, under Oyun this being was dormant. Obedient, sluggish, and dull. But they did work... they worked well.]]></string>
<string id="523474"><![CDATA[How did he control them?]]></string>
<string id="523475"><![CDATA[Just like every Foreman ever has... from generation to generation. They worshipped the traditions; they looked for bulls in the Steppe according to the Rite. Brought them to the Abattoir, invited them in, begged them to come... all along the lines of the rite. Then they killed the bulls and cut them open... Every Foreman ever. It's been like this for hundreds of years.]]></string>
<string id="523476"><![CDATA[Was he a man of noticeable influence?]]></string>
<string id="523477"><![CDATA[I don't know. I didn't really care, to be honest. Why would I—as long as meat was plenty? My son, on the other hand... he was interested... too much, really... It went against his best interests... the poor boy.]]></string>
<string id="523478"><![CDATA[Katerina... It was frightening. She foretold everything that has happened here during the last few days. She knew that Isidor was to become Simon's demise… and that Simon's death would lead to thousands more. I concluded there was going to be a riot… that he'd come back and incite an uprising among the Kin… He was planning on changing many things, you know... Who would consider a plague back then?]]></string>

<string id="523494"><![CDATA[What was he planning to change?]]></string>
<string id="523495"><![CDATA[...He had forebodings. He was muddying the waters. He claimed I was strangling the Kin... That I was killing them and that Oyun was helping me with his illicit rule. He declared that we had forgotten the law. Too many bulls were killed back then… the machines had to be establushed and tuned. The factory needed to get going... and their rites were only getting in my way... Well, Oyun was quite accomodating...]]></string>
<string id="523496"><![CDATA[Why didn't Foreman Oyun rebel against your rule?]]></string>
<string id="523497"><![CDATA[Oyun... who would allow him to be in power if not I? And even that happened by accident... Isidor has achieved his very own Great Schema… he was only interested in healing and disregarded the wordly politics. He taught the young and was learning… for many years. So what? It's all his own fault, if you ask me... he didn't want to get his hands dirty in the Abattoir, and he paid for it.]]></string>
<string id="523498"><![CDATA[And so, when my father tried to change things, you got rid of him?]]></string>
<string id="523499"><![CDATA[So you ordered to have him killed when there was unrest in the Kin?]]></string>
<string id="523500"><![CDATA[Oyun kind of… hinted that getting him to, ahem, resign wouldn't be that bad an idea. He never explained in detail how exactly this resignment would work, but there was really no need to. What other way could there be to make a Burakh resign? By that moment I have already realized what Oyun had in mind. But I never argued with him... see? I'm not trying to hide it, pray forgive me. Truth be told... it was plain to me what he was doing.]]></string>
<string id="523501"><![CDATA[What else did she say about my father?]]></string>
<string id="523502"><![CDATA[She said that Burakh will become the leader of the Kin, bringing my reign to an end. So I asked her about my son… but she said neither father nor son are to keep the power—only Burakh. Well, now I realize which Burakh she was talking about… She must have been just as clueless as to the meaning of her prophecy as I was back then... I thought it was about Isidor...]]></string>

<string id="523515"><![CDATA[Afraid? I would be... if everything hadn't come to this. But now it doesn't matter. I fear nothing.]]></string>
<string id="523516"><![CDATA[But you should.]]></string>
<string id="523517"><![CDATA[I had no doubt about that.]]></string>
<string id="523518"><![CDATA[How do you know?]]></string>
<string id="523519"><![CDATA[I have known it for a while now.]]></string>
<string id="523520"><![CDATA[I am at fault for not telling you straight away... It wasn't possible.]]></string>
<string id="523521"><![CDATA[That is low.]]></string>
<string id="523522"><![CDATA[I had no choice.]]></string>
<string id="523523"><![CDATA[How is it different now?]]></string>
<string id="523524"><![CDATA[Now... well, now Foreman Oyun has gotten square with me… in full.]]></string>
<string id="523525"><![CDATA[So it's the Foreman?]]></string>
<string id="523526"><![CDATA[Why didn't you tell me?]]></string>
<string id="523527"><![CDATA[The name. Now.]]></string>
<string id="523528"><![CDATA[No matter. He won't weasel anyone out next time.]]></string>
<string id="523529"><![CDATA[I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="523530"><![CDATA[Your udurgh is Simon. Or rather not exactly Simon; a structure, an architectural complex—so, you see, the "town" aspect of the sigil is preserved, it's actually even emphasized. Now imagine this structure taking in Simon's soul… to become alive.]]></string>
<string id="523531"><![CDATA[How can it be? I don't understand.]]></string>
<string id="523532"><![CDATA[I know, it's almost beyond comprehension. A phenomenon that can have both a scientific and a mystical interpretation… I can't explain or prove it here and now—Aglaya's got the blueprints. But it's true, trust me! A structure absorbs a soul and comes to life!]]></string>
<string id="523533"><![CDATA[Absorbs a soul? How exactly?]]></string>
<string id="523534"><![CDATA[Well, it hasn't happened yet. But the Kains guarantee they can do it. It's an interdisciplinary effort that has to do with both optics and human psyche. And a certain breakthrough.]]></string>
<string id="523535"><![CDATA[But who is my sacrifice then?]]></string>
<string id="523536"><![CDATA[I don't know. I think it's all superstition anyway.]]></string>
<string id="523537"><![CDATA[How do you know all these things about the Polyhedron, oynon?]]></string>
<string id="523538"><![CDATA[I've investigated everything thoroughly. I had a suspicion that the Polyhedron had been the cause of the outbreak.]]></string>
<string id="523539"><![CDATA[And what have you found out?]]></string>
<string id="523540"><![CDATA[Well. I've found out that there'd be nothing to be done even if it was true.]]></string>
<string id="523541"><![CDATA[How could that happen, oynon?]]></string>
<string id="523542"><![CDATA[Talk to the Foreman. He'll tell you how it was built.]]></string>
<string id="523543"><![CDATA[I will.]]></string>
<string id="523544"><![CDATA[It's too late to talk to him now.]]></string>
<string id="523545"><![CDATA[Without a sacrifice they won't give me the blood that the serum requires. I must choose the right one.]]></string>
<string id="523546"><![CDATA[Why don't you ask openly? Let the Foreman tell you what he wants from you.]]></string>
<string id="523547"><![CDATA[He wants me to guess.]]></string>
<string id="523548"><![CDATA[Well, intimidate him then. I haven't seen the Foreman, I don't know what type of person he is. But I think that a solid threat can convince anybody. Intimidate him!]]></string>
<string id="523549"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="523551"><![CDATA[Kain gave me a hint today—seems like the Foreman had something to do with your father's demise. Big Vlad is also in on it. Didn't he tell you?]]></string>
<string id="523553"><![CDATA[Yes... I already know.]]></string>
<string id="523554"><![CDATA[The blueprints?]]></string>
<string id="523555"><![CDATA[It doesn't matter! Aglaya can explain the details to you… but it may be ill-advised to ask her, I feel. She'll misrepresent them. Somehow it feels to me that my findings are not to her liking. She was expecting something else. But it's the truth! And the truth will out. Everything clicks.]]></string>
<string id="523556"><![CDATA[What makes you think it's alive?]]></string>
<string id="523557"><![CDATA[Listen... You could say it's just the Kains' family superstition, but it's obvious that a structure can serve as a soul vessel. Or rather a memory vessel. They call it memory.]]></string>
<string id="523558"><![CDATA[You mean the Tower contains Simon's soul?]]></string>
<string id="523559"><![CDATA[So a structure becomes a vessel for a soul—like a body?]]></string>
<string id="523560"><![CDATA[Precisely. Personally I am overwhelmed and humbled… I could never have imagined something like this could be possible. A chimera made of the living and the non-living. I am absolutely positive, Artemy, that this is your udurgh. Are you aware that Simon was one of Isidor's last patients?]]></string>
<string id="523561"><![CDATA[I am. Perhaps you're right, oynon.]]></string>
<string id="523562"><![CDATA[I'll consider this.]]></string>
<string id="523566"><![CDATA[So you're fine with having your father held responsible for your crime?]]></string>
<string id="523567"><![CDATA[I don't want to talk about it. Enough.]]></string>
<string id="523568"><![CDATA[How are you going to live with it?]]></string>
<string id="523569"><![CDATA[Tell me, Vlad, who killed my father?]]></string>
<string id="523570"><![CDATA[Someone from the Kin, I think. I don't know who in particular.]]></string>
<string id="523571"><![CDATA[You liar. Speak, or else…]]></string>
<string id="523572"><![CDATA[Sorry for having bothered you.]]></string>
<string id="523573"><![CDATA[Do you know something?]]></string>
<string id="523574"><![CDATA[I'm the one asking questions now.]]></string>
<string id="523575"><![CDATA[Okay. Your father was killed by Foreman Oyun.]]></string>
<string id="523576"><![CDATA[I hope it doesn't come to your father having died in vain…]]></string>
<string id="523577"><![CDATA[What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="523578"><![CDATA[He gave his life for you—but you're a breath away from dying now…]]></string>
<string id="523580"><![CDATA[I have nothing more to say.]]></string>
<string id="523582"><![CDATA[Are you still trying to protect your father?]]></string>
<string id="523583"><![CDATA[Okay. I believe you.]]></string>
<string id="523584"><![CDATA[My father had nothing to do with Isidor's death. Word of honour. You know he has nothing to lose now. He would have confessed, had he been involved with this... incident. Oyun did it all by himself. Isidor wanted to take his place, but Oyun is a beast. It didn't take him too long to decide.]]></string>
<string id="523585"><![CDATA[You'll regret this if I find out you've lied again.]]></string>
<string id="523586"><![CDATA[Okay, as you say.]]></string>
<string id="523587"><![CDATA[What choice do I have?]]></string>
<string id="523588"><![CDATA[Why are you asking me?]]></string>
<string id="523589"><![CDATA[I'm not an idiot. I can see where this is all going. The survivors, however scarce, will brand you their savior. The Kin will worshp your sacrifice, the townsfolk will remember the panacea. If you make wise choices when dealing with the Inquisitor and the Commander, they will eliminate each other.]]></string>
<string id="523590"><![CDATA[I can't see how that would gain me something…]]></string>
<string id="523591"><![CDATA[You are not being entirely honest. They will eliminate each other, and you will gain power. Just choose someone to represent a family that would support you. You will rule the Kin… and that requires a good name and charm.]]></string>
<string id="523592"><![CDATA[And you volunteer yourself as the supporter, of course.]]></string>
<string id="523593"><![CDATA[...Me? No. I volunteer my sister. Capella is going to awaken soon. She will become a Mistress, just like my mother, only even lovelier. Mistresses are obeyed unquestionably. I only hope the Kains don't stifle her progress… but I'll take care of that.]]></string>
<string id="523594"><![CDATA[I don't care for this plotting.]]></string>
<string id="523595"><![CDATA[You can take poison. Or maybe jump from the Tower.]]></string>
<string id="523596"><![CDATA[I'll think about it.]]></string>
<string id="523597"><![CDATA[You can handle it without me.]]></string>
<string id="523598"><![CDATA[What about my father? How did he make the sacrifice?]]></string>
<string id="523599"><![CDATA[Don't you know?]]></string>
<string id="523600"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="523602"><![CDATA[I did what I did. Are you going to avenge him?]]></string>
<string id="523603"><![CDATA[So you lied to me when you said that he was killed by a bull?]]></string>
<string id="523604"><![CDATA[I told you that he was killed by a Bos's horn. That was the weapon in my hands. I was acting by the rite. Your father broke the lines of the Kin.]]></string>
<string id="523605"><![CDATA[You lie!]]></string>
<string id="523606"><![CDATA[Speak.]]></string>
<string id="523607"><![CDATA[He wanted to restore the old order. He wanted to transplant old parts into a new body. Pour old blood into new veins. He broke the lines of the Kin. He died.]]></string>
<string id="523608"><![CDATA[Yes, I am. Here and now.]]></string>
<string id="523609"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="523610"><![CDATA[Raise your hands and prepare to die.]]></string>
<string id="523611"><![CDATA[And you dared to challenge a Burakh...]]></string>
<string id="523612"><![CDATA[I am alive. You are to call me Elder One now.]]></string>
<string id="523613"><![CDATA[I am no spirit. I am a man.]]></string>
<string id="523614"><![CDATA[You went into the Throat. You followed the path of water. You couldn't have come back! Or are you a sorcerer that dared to break the Lines of the House of Suok with his black magics?]]></string>
<string id="523615"><![CDATA[So you have lead me to my certain death, haven't you?]]></string>
<string id="523616"><![CDATA[Now I know who have killed my father. And you know what that means.]]></string>
<string id="523617"><![CDATA[I have. But I will restore the lines of Suok's Womb. Take one step back if you're no spirit.]]></string>
<string id="523618"><![CDATA[I am no longer where you'd sent me. See for yourself!]]></string>
<string id="523619"><![CDATA[No! Don't kill me...]]></string>
<string id="523620"><![CDATA[That is wise. You will learn who the sacrifice is then. We shall speak as equals, Burakh.]]></string>
<string id="523621"><![CDATA[What sacrifice am I to make? Speak!]]></string>
<string id="523622"><![CDATA[It had been told that the sacrifice is Aglaya Lilich, a woman who wanted to merge her lines with yours. Butchers would have opened the blood for you if you had killed her—if I had allowed it, of course, or if you had killed me. But it was I that killed you in the end.]]></string>
<string id="523623"><![CDATA[I don't need you to allow me anything.]]></string>
<string id="523624"><![CDATA[You are mistaken.]]></string>
<string id="523625"><![CDATA[Why can we only speak as equals after the trial?]]></string>
<string id="523626"><![CDATA[Everyone goes through the trial... So did your father. It is only then that you will see how far the Vein of Boddho goes. You will walk along it and circle back, tying life and death together just as a vein is tied into a knot. A vein wastes precious blood in vain when untied.]]></string>
<string id="523627"><![CDATA[How do I do that?]]></string>
<string id="523628"><![CDATA[Go out of here and to the right. Step into the next cave. It is the Hollow of Her Primal Womb. You will see a well—this is where Her navel is untied for those who have the knowledge. Then you will fall down. Lay your body down there and come towards Suok's navel. Go to the heart of Her lines. Then come back here. And then we will talk.]]></string>
<string id="523629"><![CDATA[Tell me what to do.]]></string>
<string id="523630"><![CDATA[I feel there is a catch. I'll come back to you later.]]></string>
<string id="523631"><![CDATA[That simple?]]></string>
<string id="523632"><![CDATA[You will see.]]></string>
<string id="523633"><![CDATA[Okay.]]></string>
<string id="523634"><![CDATA[When did my father pass the trial?]]></string>
<string id="523635"><![CDATA[Later than he should have... You ask too many questions. Are you going?]]></string>
<string id="523636"><![CDATA[I am.]]></string>
<string id="523637"><![CDATA[What do I do?]]></string>
<string id="523638"><![CDATA[Go into that cave. It is the Hollow of Her Primal Womb. You will see a well—this is where Her navel is untied for those who have the knowledge. Then you will fall down. Lay your body down there and come towards Suok's navel. Go to the heart of Her lines. Then come back here. And then we will talk.]]></string>
<string id="523639"><![CDATA[I am ready.]]></string>
<string id="523640"><![CDATA[That simple?]]></string>
<string id="523641"><![CDATA[You will see.]]></string>
<string id="523642"><![CDATA[Okay.]]></string>
<string id="523644"><![CDATA[You really don't have to.]]></string>
<string id="523645"><![CDATA[Advise me, Kindred One.]]></string>
<string id="523646"><![CDATA[You know everything. We're waiting for you to make a sacrifice, oynon. Make it by the rite. Cut its lines open. Then rule over us. All of Bos Turokh's blood will flow through you, for you are the heart of the Kin. Be worthy of that name.]]></string>
<string id="523647"><![CDATA[I have to make my sacrifice.]]></string>
<string id="523648"><![CDATA[I know about the sacrifice. Is that all?]]></string>
<string id="523649"><![CDATA[I have to pass his trial and survive.]]></string>
<string id="523650"><![CDATA[Are you going to fight him?]]></string>
<string id="523651"><![CDATA[Why did you put so much pressure on me then?]]></string>
<string id="523652"><![CDATA[Foreman Oyun killed your father. Did you know this?]]></string>
<string id="523653"><![CDATA[…It is decided then. I will become the end of him.]]></string>
<string id="523654"><![CDATA[The Foreman is nigh unkillable—even by you. He's older and stronger. I think all is lost now. If chance doesn't help you until tomorrow, step down. The Burakhs have lost their claim.]]></string>
<string id="523655"><![CDATA[I wouldn't have asked you if I knew, Kindred One.]]></string>
<string id="523656"><![CDATA[He was very clever. He didn't kill a person, even though that's what was expected. He took a sickle and cut down a field of nine-year-old swevery with it. I don't think he really expected that blood would flow from the stems—but it did. That's how the marsh was formed; the Gullet was full of blood for two days straight. Then Bos Turokh accepted him.]]></string>
<string id="523657"><![CDATA[Don't you know that already?]]></string>
<string id="523658"><![CDATA[Yes, that is all.]]></string>
<string id="523659"><![CDATA[I don't think so. Why would I?]]></string>
<string id="523660"><![CDATA[Foreman Oyun is lying to you. The Kin will never follow your lead while he's alive. No one cares about the challenger, even a challenger of a superior bloodline, while the old priest is still there. There's no point in you making the sacrifice. Not while he's still alive.]]></string>
<string id="523661"><![CDATA[But I don't want to kill him...]]></string>
<string id="523663"><![CDATA[Good. Everybody kills. But there's something else you should know.]]></string>
<string id="523664"><![CDATA[What?]]></string>
<string id="523665"><![CDATA[What about my father? Did he kill too?]]></string>
<string id="523666"><![CDATA[Yes, I think this is where it's all going.]]></string>
<string id="523667"><![CDATA[He did. He made a sacrifice and shed rivers of blood.]]></string>
<string id="523668"><![CDATA[Is that all I'm supposed to do?]]></string>
<string id="523669"><![CDATA[Really? It takes a load off my mind then...]]></string>
<string id="523670"><![CDATA[I was hoping that he'd go down by chance. That the soldiers would bust into the Abattoir, that the Worms, terrified by the plague, would become irrational… it happens. You've been having a very good fortune, things were working out very well for you. But now he's triumphant. Nothing can bring him down now, not even the plague.]]></string>
<string id="523671"><![CDATA[So I will kill him.]]></string>
<string id="523675"><![CDATA[The Kin will renounce him if we tell them!]]></string>
<string id="523676"><![CDATA[You are mistaken. Gasp in horror—yes. They will also respect him even more. We are beasts. Beasts follow the strongest. The leader. The victor.]]></string>
<string id="523677"><![CDATA[So what should I do?]]></string>
<string id="523678"><![CDATA[I'll follow your advice.]]></string>
<string id="523679"><![CDATA[Where does the power of the Copious taglurs come from?]]></string>
<string id="523681"><![CDATA[How can the Foreman rule without troops? Why does the Kin yield to him? How do the leaders of the ruling families accept it?]]></string>
<string id="523682"><![CDATA[It's the power of standing. Each party has their own domain. The power of the Taglurs arose naturally to fill the corners of reality that the rulers would never understand; you people only offered the rulers the leftovers of that power. The Olgimskys haven't been holding the Kin in their grasp for all that long, you know. The odonghs are stronger.]]></string>
<string id="523683"><![CDATA[Why the unrest in the Termitary then?]]></string>
<string id="523684"><![CDATA[It's not always smooth... Sometimes Foremen would get too old, sometimes the Kin would rise in response to Suok's fever. Sometimes they couldn't find a common tongue with the commandants of the Termitary. Sometimes Mistresses would turn their gaze towards the Kin—but generally the Kin is compliant.]]></string>
<string id="523685"><![CDATA[So, the Burakhs' standing is still high, isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="523686"><![CDATA[Explain yourself.]]></string>
<string id="523687"><![CDATA[I've fallen in love with you, oynon. I care too much; I so desperately want you to live. You were brought up away from here, you've forgotten our rites and customs. You were in need of a friend here, a mentor. It was easier for me to keep your belongings for the time being—easier than trying to explain why they are dangerous to keep... and even more dangerous to use.]]></string>
<string id="523688"><![CDATA[What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="523689"><![CDATA[It's a bone, a Bos Primigenius's horn. Here, it confirms that you are the eldest of the Burakhs, that you know the rite and preserve the art of a Copious taglur.]]></string>
<string id="523690"><![CDATA[What was it that you preferred not to share with me?]]></string>
<string id="523691"><![CDATA[A copious taglur?]]></string>
<string id="523692"><![CDATA[The Burakhs are a Copious taglur. You know the lines, you know how to cut a body open. The rite is your right. There are but a few families of the kind left. I had no right to make this choice for you…]]></string>
<string id="523693"><![CDATA[Give me the bone.]]></string>
<string id="523694"><![CDATA[It is rightfully yours. Take it and forgive me… I swear that I meant well. Had I not abused the situation, you'd have been dead by now. You will now be once again accused of patricide by many… the week-old story will repeat itself. Be prepared.]]></string>
<string id="523695"><![CDATA[Fallen in love?]]></string>
<string id="523696"><![CDATA[Like a slave falls in love with their master; like a thing falls in love with its owner—it is dog's affection. I know it's forbidden for an odongh to couple with a woman from the Kin. I am simply devoted to you, oynon.]]></string>
<string id="523697"><![CDATA[I see. So what was it that you preferred to postpone sharing with me?]]></string>
<string id="523698"><![CDATA[So, it wasn't you the local… crones were talking about.]]></string>
<string id="523699"><![CDATA[Absolutely.]]></string>
<string id="523700"><![CDATA[Go on then.]]></string>
<string id="523701"><![CDATA[What about Oyun?]]></string>
<string id="523702"><![CDATA[He is too. He's weaker, much weaker than the alternatives—that's why he's handy for the Olgimsky leeches. They're all wolves of a pack, conspirators intent on weakening the Kin! Were it not for the leeches, the Kin would have long risen against Oyun!]]></string>
<string id="523703"><![CDATA[They know the lines, duh! It's clear as day, isn't it? They know how to open up and turn around the cryptic lines of a body, a word, the sky, the earth, and even water. That's how it used to be anyway.]]></string>
<string id="523704"><![CDATA[That's not what I'm talking about. How come the power this knowledge grants to its bearer is so great?]]></string>
<string id="523705"><![CDATA[Why is that a surprise?]]></string>
<string id="523706"><![CDATA[I get it, thank you.]]></string>
<string id="523707"><![CDATA[Correct. You've passed the test.]]></string>
<string id="523708"><![CDATA[You are one smart lady...]]></string>
<string id="523709"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="523710"><![CDATA[Because he doesn't know the lines, that's why! How is he an odongh at all? Fetching water for your father—that's his place, and nothing more. His hands are strong, he knows the rite, but his will is weak. The art escapes him. When your father resigned, the age of Knowledge was replaced with the age of Burden and brute force.]]></string>
<string id="523711"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="523712"><![CDATA[I've heard that before.]]></string>
<string id="523713"><![CDATA[The power of the Copious taglurs is great. Never forget that, oynon. The ruling families get diplomacy, polyhedrons, politics, and intrigue. We get the earth, the primal power, the cycles, and the bulky movement of life. The eternal battle for the harvest. The annual birth. The heat and the meat.]]></string>
<string id="523714"><![CDATA[I'll keep that in mind.]]></string>
<string id="523715"><![CDATA[Why did you hide it from me?]]></string>
<string id="523716"><![CDATA[...Intuition. Also... I have a strong feeling that this is the exact horn that had pierced your father's chest. I managed to snatch it from under the nose of Saburov's crazed henchmen while they were inspecting the crime scene. Had I given it to you, you would have been walking around the place with the murder weapon in your pocket.]]></string>
<string id="523717"><![CDATA[Tell me about the other families.]]></string>
<string id="523718"><![CDATA[You did wrong.]]></string>
<string id="523719"><![CDATA[What you did was right.]]></string>
<string id="523720"><![CDATA[Few families still hold the right to carry out the rite in this part of the Steppe—the Mangyzes, the Beshetches, the Burakhs, the Oyuns, and the Kryuks. The last of the Magyzes died... he was basically killed by Black Nina. The Beshetches used to know the lines almost as well as the Mangyzes, but they've been brought to naught by twyrine...]]></string>
<string id="523721"><![CDATA[It'll be different now. I will take care of it all—on my own.]]></string>
<string id="523722"><![CDATA[Were they the best?]]></string>
<string id="523723"><![CDATA[Yes. Well, each family had its own line of work—and each was rather brilliant when handling their line. The Burakhs, for example, have always been talented healers. The Mangyzes were the most ruthless and decisive, the Beshetches were the greatest in number. The Oyuns and the Kryuks have never been taken seriously... they are apprentices, not masters.]]></string>
<string id="523724"><![CDATA[Give me the bone.]]></string>
<string id="523725"><![CDATA[Yet you will not get an answer. Why should I share this knowledge with you? You cannot take it, and it will rip you apart.]]></string>
<string id="523726"><![CDATA[I am the son of Isidor Burakh. It's not an Oyun's place to talk to me about knowledge.]]></string>
<string id="523727"><![CDATA[I see before me someone who calls himself a son of Burakh. You haven't accepted his inheritance and are therefore unworthy of his name.]]></string>
<string id="523728"><![CDATA[Lie! I've accepted my father's inheritance in full.]]></string>

<string id="523730"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="523731"><![CDATA[Have you accepted his knowledge? Have you accepted his lines? Have you learned how to tell the dark from the light, the damp from the crumbling, the scorching from the cold, the dead from the living?]]></string>
<string id="523732"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="523733"><![CDATA[Have you accepted his possessions? His house, his flesh, his food, and his signs?]]></string>
<string id="523734"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="523735"><![CDATA[I haven't.]]></string>
<string id="523736"><![CDATA[Then there is nothing to talk about. You are not your father's son until his lines are continued through you. Leave.]]></string>
<string id="523737"><![CDATA[I haven't.]]></string>
<string id="523738"><![CDATA[I'll be back.]]></string>
<string id="523739"><![CDATA[I haven't.]]></string>
<string id="523740"><![CDATA[Accepting it is my personal business.]]></string>
<string id="523741"><![CDATA[Then show me the thing that he used to draw the lines on the ground with when opening them up for a ritual. Where is his udey, which should be hanging around your neck proudly so that everyone can see who is in charge of the lines of the Burakhs' taglur?]]></string>
<string id="523742"><![CDATA[I don't know what you're talking about.]]></string>
<string id="523743"><![CDATA[I will fix that.]]></string>
<string id="523744"><![CDATA[I will only speak to you when you have your father's udey hanging from your neck. Seems like something has been concealed from you by the one that passed the inheritance to you.]]></string>
<string id="523745"><![CDATA[But the rite didn't go the way you wanted it to. You couldn't get living blood from the beast killed the day before yesterday.]]></string>
<string id="523746"><![CDATA[That is so, but I can draw it from the earth. It is the blood that feeds Suok's body, the blood that flows through her veins underground, the blood that we have been pouring there since time immemorial, feeding Bos Turokh's body to be fed by him in return.]]></string>
<string id="523747"><![CDATA[So you've taken this blood from below the ground? How old is it?]]></string>
<string id="523748"><![CDATA[Warmed by Suok's body, brought to life by Suok's breath, the currents of thousands upon thousands upon thousands of bulls cut open lie undergound. Its age should be of no concern to you. It has been the living blood of Suok from the moment it was poured into Bos Turokh's veins.]]></string>
<string id="523749"><![CDATA[Where exactly is the entrance point that the blood gets poured into?]]></string>
<string id="523750"><![CDATA[I will tell you of this too. Here, in the Abattoir, at the heart of the house of Suok, lies a well that is connected to the veins feeding the earth.]]></string>
<string id="523751"><![CDATA[Can blood be extracted from there?]]></string>
<string id="523752"><![CDATA[Only by an odongh, the Foreman of the Abattoir, who belongs to a Long taglur and knows the rite. The blood rises from down below heeding his call. But I will not call this blood for you until we are equal.]]></string>
<string id="523753"><![CDATA[Why not?]]></string>
<string id="523754"><![CDATA[Because I do not want you to have it. You are unworthy of thinking about it, let alone taking it. It was not you, but boös Vlad that I gave the blood to before—to help him and on his orders.]]></string>
<string id="523755"><![CDATA[So how can I get this blood?]]></string>
<string id="523756"><![CDATA[By making the sacrifice and fulfilling your father's duty. By passing every trial, completing every task and proving that you are worthy of making such a sacrifice. Not before that. Come tomorrow, we shall talk about it.]]></string>
<string id="523758"><![CDATA[I have, I'll show you. A funny coincidence… She was looking for you too—and looked serious about it! I literally cowered when I saw her. This Clara's up to something. Chances are she'll outsmart us all.]]></string>
<string id="523759"><![CDATA[So where is she?]]></string>
<string id="523760"><![CDATA[At Murky's van.]]></string>
<string id="523761"><![CDATA[What business would she have with her?]]></string>
<string id="523762"><![CDATA[Oh, it's all been going so fast with Clara lately... It's all secrets—all of them sinister. She's creepy. Hanging around, asking things, showing her teeth… And there's never an answer if you ask her anything. Yep, she does give me the creeps.]]></string>
<string id="523763"><![CDATA[And I know you're no coward…]]></string>
<string id="523764"><![CDATA[My point exactly, be careful with her... She's up to something! I don't like it. She might as well make the both of us links in her chain... I feel she already has. We won't just be fooled, we'll end up being the bad guys.]]></string>
<string id="523765"><![CDATA[We'll deal with it.]]></string>
<string id="523766"><![CDATA[You too, Notkin? You schemers…]]></string>
<string id="523767"><![CDATA[What did she want?]]></string>
<string id="523768"><![CDATA[What makes you think she's trying something smart?]]></string>
<string id="523769"><![CDATA[No bloody idea. She has an agenda. Looked triumphant, too. As though you've given her a jackpot.]]></string>
<string id="523770"><![CDATA[Where is she now?]]></string>
<string id="523785"><![CDATA[What's so costly about it?]]></string>
<string id="523786"><![CDATA[Immunity boosters for the scouts. I'm tired of explaining it over and over.]]></string>
<string id="523787"><![CDATA[What kind of a payment is that?]]></string>
<string id="523788"><![CDATA[It's all in the interests of the scouts who make the map, Burakh. They're being threatened. They get killed by precisely those people, the marauders. Get it?]]></string>
<string id="523789"><![CDATA[I don't understand. Why is the well filled up?]]></string>
<string id="523790"><![CDATA[It's a rather sorry story. A gang of marauders tried to escape a blocked-off district with their loot and ran into unexpected and courageous resistance. Patrolmen were there too… but that's not the point.]]></string>
<string id="523791"><![CDATA[Yeah, it doesn't make sense yet.]]></string>
<string id="523792"><![CDATA[The bandits were not of the timid sort themselves. They pulled out guns and began shooting, trying to mount a retreat. After killing two of their pursuers, running along roofs and backyards, they somehow got to this area. Then one of them remembered this well of mine...]]></string>
<string id="523793"><![CDATA[Perhaps there was a worker of yours among them.]]></string>
<string id="523794"><![CDATA[You're a quick thinker... precisely. The clumsy townsfolk lagged behind, taking the long route, so the marauders had the time to break into here, throw the loot in, and even go down the well themselves. The pursuit was on my step already, you know...]]></string>
<string id="523795"><![CDATA[What happened next?]]></string>
<string id="523797"><![CDATA[Climbing roofs and waterpipes requires certain skills! It's not like anyone can do it…]]></string>
<string id="523798"><![CDATA[I've found the bastards too. I barely escaped with a whole skin.]]></string>
<string id="523799"><![CDATA[I thought we had an agreement that I keep everything else.]]></string>
<string id="523800"><![CDATA[I promised to reward the risk you took. I keep my word.]]></string>
<string id="523801"><![CDATA[Oh, surely. Especially since I've gotten that which is most valuable to me back.]]></string>
<string id="523802"><![CDATA[So we're even?]]></string>
<string id="523803"><![CDATA[That is unnecessary. It doesn't feel right accept your money.]]></string>
<string id="523804"><![CDATA[I can't—no matter how I try.]]></string>
<string id="523805"><![CDATA[Yeah... These bastards are pissing everyone off!]]></string>
<string id="523806"><![CDATA[When the townsfolk broke in, they saw the last of the bandits descending into the well. They tried to continuie the pursuit, but the bandits started shooting and killed one more. I'm pretty sure they were sitting there, waiting for their targets-to-be to follow them one by one. And then one of the pursuers got this clever idea...]]></string>
<string id="523807"><![CDATA[To fill up the well.]]></string>
<string id="523808"><![CDATA[Exactly. WIthout a moment's hesitation these honest people decided to bury the marauders alive. As you can see, they succeeded. It's not the loss of the well that troubles me though—I've had plenty of opportunities to make sure it's barren. There was a great loss, however...]]></string>
<string id="523809"><![CDATA[As in?]]></string>
<string id="523810"><![CDATA[How do you know that?]]></string>
<string id="523811"><![CDATA[The pursuers told me about it. They should have left the marauders in peace!]]></string>
<string id="523812"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="523813"><![CDATA[Did they push them down the well or something?]]></string>
<string id="523814"><![CDATA[Indeed! If I'm not mistaken, there is a secret passage by the Theatre that leads underground. Anything that you find on the robbers is yours. Moreover, I will reward you very generously! These notes are priceless for me. Like the fifty two recipes of twyrine... or the description of the Rite of Heads...]]></string>
<string id="523815"><![CDATA[So, you want me to go down there and fetch them?]]></string>
<string id="523816"><![CDATA[Try to focus on the good things.]]></string>
<string id="523817"><![CDATA[What do you mean "not real"... It's about mommy and daddy!]]></string>
<string id="523818"><![CDATA[You shouldn't think about it like that.]]></string>
<string id="523819"><![CDATA[No, no! What if in the end I'll find out how to see them? What if they come back?]]></string>
<string id="523820"><![CDATA[Oh Clara...]]></string>
<string id="523821"><![CDATA[I'll stop by tomorrow, we'll think of something.]]></string>
<string id="523822"><![CDATA[It's about an orphan and the underground dwellers. About gehken—the falselegs who undermine houses... And about the water from Sugagh Khadugh.]]></string>
<string id="523823"><![CDATA[What's so scary about it?]]></string>
<string id="523824"><![CDATA[A lot of it is. I asked Clara if she could speak to my parents and ask them how I can protect myself from getting infected. And she said she'll tell me a fairytale and they'll come to life and I'll be able to speak to them myself... And she began talking.]]></string>
<string id="523825"><![CDATA[Come to life? How's that?]]></string>
<string id="523826"><![CDATA[I don't know... You can't tell by the fairytale because she hasn't finished it. Ooh, it's gnawing at me!]]></string>
<string id="523827"><![CDATA[Speak to them yourself? So, is she planning to animate the dead?]]></string>
<string id="523828"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="523829"><![CDATA[Because she called mommy and daddy. That's how it was in the tale. What if they come and I miss them? I don't know where they are supposed to arrive to. You only find out about the location in the ending!]]></string>
<string id="523830"><![CDATA[Don't waste your time.]]></string>
<string id="523832"><![CDATA[Storytelling? Some people do…]]></string>
<string id="523833"><![CDATA[What are gehken?]]></string>
<string id="523834"><![CDATA[The falselegs... They're these ugly little men, like worms... They don't love anyone. The orphan wanted to talk to his parents... And for that he had to make the falselegs love him... And they are so horrible! Nasty, nasty! I hate them...]]></string>
<string id="523835"><![CDATA[Don't cry. Come on! Are you a baby? Or are they really dangerous?]]></string>
<string id="523836"><![CDATA[That's nothing.]]></string>
<string id="523837"><![CDATA[Let's talk about the Termitary.]]></string>
<string id="523838"><![CDATA[Do you really want to go that way? What have you been told?]]></string>
<string id="523839"><![CDATA[I've been told that it's your fault.]]></string>
<string id="523840"><![CDATA[It's not my place to talk about it. Leave it be! It's a family matter.]]></string>
<string id="523841"><![CDATA[The wretched Worms you've been starving in the Termitary may well soon become my kin.]]></string>
<string id="523842"><![CDATA[What was that supposed to mean? Are you talking about your… priesthood? Your father's legacy, your Foreman ambitions? The revenge of the Burakhs?]]></string>
<string id="523843"><![CDATA[Perhaps.]]></string>
<string id="523844"><![CDATA[So we'll talk when that happens. The Olgimskys—whoever of us is the eldest and in charge—will report the state of the Termitary to the Kin then. As for now, topic closed.]]></string>
<string id="523845"><![CDATA[It won't take long.]]></string>
<string id="523846"><![CDATA[...Yes. You're slick!]]></string>
<string id="523847"><![CDATA[Slick? Why?]]></string>
<string id="523848"><![CDATA[You know who's to blame!]]></string>
<string id="523849"><![CDATA[Do you know for sure who the culprit is?]]></string>
<string id="523850"><![CDATA[Hmmm... I don't—not for sure, anyway. But I think it's Fat Vlad.]]></string>
<string id="523851"><![CDATA[Mother, what kind of punishment is in store for that person?]]></string>
<string id="523852"><![CDATA[The terrible kind. I'll let Worms and butchers have their way with him. They'll take that person upstairs, to a small room on the upper floor; even I'm not allowed into that room. Then they'll draw straws, deciding who goes in and who stays out to hold guard. Some of them will join the culprit in the small room, only to emerge after a while and go to sleep for three days. Neither the prisoner nor his remains will be found inside.]]></string>
<string id="523853"><![CDATA[Will they devour him or something?]]></string>
<string id="523854"><![CDATA[I'm telling you, I'm not allowed into that room.]]></string>
<string id="523855"><![CDATA[Well, so do you most likely. Don't you?]]></string>
<string id="523856"><![CDATA[Do you want to know for sure?]]></string>
<string id="523857"><![CDATA[Well, I'm not telling you.]]></string>
<string id="523858"><![CDATA[Right! I doesn't matter who did what; he's the head of the family, so it's him who is to bear responsibility. Dad did that for me too.]]></string>
<string id="523859"><![CDATA[Is that so…]]></string>
<string id="523860"><![CDATA[Sounds legit. You are very slick, oynon!]]></string>
<string id="523861"><![CDATA[No. I'm an honest person.]]></string>
<string id="523862"><![CDATA[Well, they are right.]]></string>
<string id="523863"><![CDATA[Do it then!]]></string>
<string id="523864"><![CDATA[I'll reveal the gate for you if you reveal something to me as well. Fair barter. Deal?]]></string>
<string id="523865"><![CDATA[It depends on what you want.]]></string>
<string id="523866"><![CDATA[And what does she want?]]></string>
<string id="523867"><![CDATA[Some! Thing! You should hear her tell stories, too. I'm completely at her mercy now… and I feel like I'll have to do whatever she tells me to. I don't get it at all… and I think I'll end up giving up my life for her.]]></string>
<string id="523868"><![CDATA[What? Oh, please don't cry…]]></string>
<string id="523869"><![CDATA[Yes, yes... Either that—or she'll demand something that shouldn't be given away... She'll come here soon, she'll get back to her riddles... Oh, what can I do to stand up to her…? Perhaps Capella could help? Then again, maybe not…]]></string>
<string id="523870"><![CDATA[So what do you want me to reveal to you?]]></string>
<string id="523871"><![CDATA[It's just a story though...]]></string>
<string id="523872"><![CDATA[No it's not! Don't talk like you know anything about it! Klara has inexplicable power over me now... I'm so scared of her…]]></string>
<string id="523873"><![CDATA[Is there anything I could do to help?]]></string>
<string id="523874"><![CDATA[Reveal the ending of Clara's story to me! Remember, it's a story about an icy prince and a crystal flower. How does it end? I need to know! Then she can come here all she wants—I'd be ready, knowing everything! And she wouldn't be able to force me… I'll get unhooked!]]></string>
<string id="523875"><![CDATA[I don't have time for fancy stories.]]></string>
<string id="523876"><![CDATA[Deal.]]></string>
<string id="523877"><![CDATA[As time went by, the crystal flower became the greediest in the garden. It drank all the earth's juices. But most importantly, it also snatched all sunlight. The garden became so dark that even the air has turned cold.]]></string>
<string id="523878"><![CDATA[Oh, oh… And what did the prince do when the time has come to pick the crystal flower?]]></string>
<string id="523879"><![CDATA[The prince killed the gardener.]]></string>
<string id="523880"><![CDATA[The prince covered it with his own body.]]></string>
<string id="523881"><![CDATA[The prince executed a crafty plan: he engineered it so that the gardener would pick a different flower instead of the crystal one.]]></string>
<string id="523882"><![CDATA[Yeah, sounds right! It's all been coming to that... So did the flower end up all alone in an empty garden?]]></string>
<string id="523883"><![CDATA[Yes. It blossomed, spread its seeds all over the place, and a new garden grew, a hundred times more beautiful than the one before.]]></string>
<string id="523884"><![CDATA[It did—and it kept growing, but it was also killing the garden. And so in the end it has withered too.]]></string>
<string id="523885"><![CDATA[No. Nothing changed.]]></string>
<string id="523886"><![CDATA[No, that can't be right... it doesn't feel right at all. I'll have to wait for Clara.]]></string>
<string id="523887"><![CDATA[So that's how it is... Yes, that sounds right... What a bad prince! Why did he have to kill the simple flowers...]]></string>
<string id="523888"><![CDATA[They were arguing if the bandits could get out, but agreed that they couldn't. It was only Lisa and the other Lisa, I mean the Mole, that disagreed.]]></string>
<string id="523889"><![CDATA[What were they saying?]]></string>
<string id="523890"><![CDATA[Well, the opinion of the majority is what matters.]]></string>
<string id="523891"><![CDATA[Have the people that were talking ever been in that well at all?]]></string>
<string id="523892"><![CDATA[No, none of them have. Why do you ask?]]></string>
<string id="523893"><![CDATA[I want to get there, but I don' know how.]]></string>
<string id="523894"><![CDATA[…They heard some kind of noise behind the Theatre. That particular night. Screams even. They are superstitious women though, so they agreed it was the earth crying.]]></string>
<string id="523895"><![CDATA[The earth crying?]]></string>
<string id="523896"><![CDATA[There's something there, there must be. Or maybe someone. The earth has its own manner of speech. It "screams with twyre"—you know the expression, right? But there may be something in the chambers below the Theatre…]]></string>
<string id="523897"><![CDATA[Perhaps... Anything's possible.]]></string>
<string id="523898"><![CDATA[I'll try my luck there.]]></string>
<string id="523899"><![CDATA[The Soul-and-a-Halves have told me a funny story... about crystal flowers or something.]]></string>
<string id="523900"><![CDATA[Hmm… was that maybe the wrong thing to say? Eh? What do you think, Changeling?]]></string>
<string id="523901"><![CDATA[How do they even know that tale?]]></string>
<string id="523902"><![CDATA[No idea. The ending is really funny though…]]></string>
<string id="523903"><![CDATA[There's nothing funny about it! It's scary actually. It couldn't have made them laugh...]]></string>
<string id="523904"><![CDATA[They were totally hysterical. Especially when it got to that prince…]]></string>
<string id="523905"><![CDATA[They couldn't have laughed! What made them laugh? The prince getting desperate and thinking that a flower like this would never grow in his garden again? Or maybe the living flowers dying because the crystal one took everything from them—the water, the air, and even the light? Is it that bit?]]></string>
<string id="523906"><![CDATA[No, another one…]]></string>
<string id="523907"><![CDATA[Well, was it the gardener coming with the scissors and the prince making it so that he'd cut the living flowers instead of the crystal one? Or that terrible flower throwing out seeds, giving birth to a whole new garden—a hundred times more beautiful than the previous one, but having no real flowers?]]></string>
<string id="523909"><![CDATA[Okay, okay…]]></string>
<string id="523910"><![CDATA[Don't you threaten me! I've been threatened enough! And don't stick your nose into things you know nothing about!]]></string>

<string id="523914"><![CDATA[Tell me how it ends!]]></string>
<string id="523915"><![CDATA[Get lost! And don't you ever cross me! I don't interfere with you cutting livers out of living people, now do I?! And just so that you know, I feel sorry for them! I could very well complicate your life quite a bit!]]></string>

<string id="523917"><![CDATA[Okay, okay, peace.]]></string>
<string id="523918"><![CDATA[And how does it end?]]></string>
<string id="523919"><![CDATA[...Why do you ask? Hey, you're cheating! You're in cahoots with the Mother!]]></string>
<string id="523920"><![CDATA[No I'm not...]]></string>
<string id="523921"><![CDATA[Yeah, I think so.]]></string>
<string id="523922"><![CDATA[Well, they are idiots! How do they even know the tale, I wonder?]]></string>
<string id="523923"><![CDATA[And what happens next?]]></string>
<string id="523924"><![CDATA[There was something else...]]></string>
<string id="523925"><![CDATA[That's the end. There couldn't have been anything else. They're lying!]]></string>
<string id="523926"><![CDATA[That was the bit.]]></string>
<string id="523927"><![CDATA[Those idiots! They've no idea what they're laughing at…]]></string>
<string id="523928"><![CDATA[Yeah, you are one scary wench…]]></string>

<string id="523954"><![CDATA[...In truth, the catastrophic act that killed thousands of people was not a product of rational planning, but rather that of hesitancy and reluctance. That's the reason why they were trying to hide the outbreak; hesitancy and reluctance are quite common in younger people.]]></string>
<string id="523955"><![CDATA[Younger people?]]></string>
<string id="523956"><![CDATA[Precisely. It is Vlad the Younger and not his father whom we should hold responsible for this terrifying crime. Vlad the Younger gave the order at his own risk… and then kept it a secret from his father. It was already too late when my noble ally and opponent learned of these developments... and so he took the blame for his son.]]></string>
<string id="523957"><![CDATA[Don't call me that. I don't like it.]]></string>
<string id="523958"><![CDATA[As you wish. So, will you listen to me?]]></string>
<string id="523959"><![CDATA[What do you want?]]></string>
<string id="523960"><![CDATA[What was he guilty of?]]></string>
<string id="523961"><![CDATA[Long story short, when he gave--or pretended to give--the order to lock down the Termitary, he was already fully aware of the highly contagious disease that the Kin had fallen victim to. Apparently, he imagined that some natural traits of the Steppe people and their amazing vitality would allow them to do away with the plague on their own...]]></string>
<string id="523962"><![CDATA[Did he now?]]></string>
<string id="523963"><![CDATA[Well, keeping in mind how volatile these people may be, the Olgimskys were also striving to protect the town from an onset of blood-crazed plague-sufferers. In other words, if they didn't try to hide their decision, it may have been understood and supported. But then Simon's death wrought havoc with their plans.]]></string>
<string id="523964"><![CDATA[So where are you going with this?]]></string>
<string id="523965"><![CDATA[So what can I do?]]></string>
<string id="523966"><![CDATA[Report this to the governor... Or even his wife, since I heard of some bad blood between you and Alexander. If you won't, I have good reasons to believe the Inquisitor will order Vlad the Heavy's execution.]]></string>
<string id="523967"><![CDATA[Why can't you tell the governor… or his wife, yourself?]]></string>
<string id="523968"><![CDATA[Because they trust the Kains even less than they trust the Burakhs. Especially now that Katerina feels… what kind of powerful emotions you have stirred in the steely Inquisitor. You left a strong impression on her yesterday. Maria feels it too…]]></string>
<string id="523970"><![CDATA[That's a surprise.]]></string>
<string id="523971"><![CDATA[That is absolutely none of your business!]]></string>
<string id="523972"><![CDATA[Indeed. So, will you help... your benefactor? Or, shall we say, your partner in misfortune…]]></string>
<string id="523973"><![CDATA[Really?]]></string>
<string id="523974"><![CDATA[They say this is what merchant families do... They will happily backstab one another in their everyday affairs—yet when the heir is in danger, they put it all behind and rush to the rescue. They'll stop at nothing to pull the opponent apart then; with their teeth if needs be...]]></string>
<string id="523975"><![CDATA[What do you want from me?]]></string>
<string id="523976"><![CDATA[That's just my perfume.]]></string>
<string id="523977"><![CDATA["Whichever comes"? What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="523978"><![CDATA[Well... they want a person... an expiatory sacrifice. Father or son… they don't care... they couldn't tell anyway. A family is a single body for them. You can cut a thief's right hand off or the left one… it's all the same. Not for Georgiy though! You can't see his scheme... it's political.]]></string>
<string id="523979"><![CDATA[How is it political?]]></string>
<string id="523980"><![CDATA[Men... come and go. The family stays. And what matters is who rules it... Georgiy is leaving... So he's setting the table for his heirs... The terrible Maria... and Khan... he doesn't need a young... clever... vigorous... Olgimsky ruler.]]></string>
<string id="523981"><![CDATA[Why isn't he in charge?]]></string>
<string id="523982"><![CDATA[He is a nobody now. A short-lived ruler… That's because we've got this… wench instead now… I won't say anything else though. You're also getting too close to her… for your own good…]]></string>
<string id="523983"><![CDATA[Let's get back to business. So it's up to the Kin?]]></string>
<string id="523984"><![CDATA[Is Big Vlad easier to handle?]]></string>
<string id="523985"><![CDATA[He is old... he will die soon... And he's compromised by the Termitary deal anyway... Oh, it's a fine scheme! A blow that will hit everyone... my husband too... It was him he sent you to… it's him he's planning to hold responsible later… oh, Georgiy, Georgiy... it's a scheme that would befit Simon!]]></string>
<string id="523986"><![CDATA[What should I do?]]></string>
<string id="523987"><![CDATA[Leave us alone... I've seen through his game straight away... go to the Mother... let the Kin devour whoever they want... it's all over anyway. Over... Let everyone choose how they die at least…]]></string>
<string id="523988"><![CDATA[He sent me to you, not to your husband.]]></string>
<string id="523989"><![CDATA[I want to solemnly ask you for assistance. I beg you to help me with a cause that's not only good, but also crucial for the whole town. Save a few children's lives.]]></string>
<string id="523990"><![CDATA[Are they in danger?]]></string>
<string id="523991"><![CDATA[Yes. The terrible Clara wants to get personal gain at the cost of their childish magnanimity—and their lives. And I cannot do anything! She breeds ill blood between us! I will do anything for you if you help me save them.]]></string>
<string id="523992"><![CDATA[Why these particular kids?]]></string>
<string id="523993"><![CDATA[They are special. Both me and Clara care for the same qualities of theirs… only from different angles. It is what we need—what is useful to us, if you will. Independence. Importance. Standing. It's just that I care for their personalities, and she needs something else... she wants to sacrifice them for something!]]></string>
<string id="523994"><![CDATA[You want me to look after them?]]></string>
<string id="523995"><![CDATA[I acknowledge you. You are Capella.]]></string>
<string id="523996"><![CDATA[Funny, is it not? So you do acknowledge me. Just looks at us—a bare-legged girl and a disenfranchised outcast, orphaned too… you are a son of an odongh, true, but that only makes it worse—oh, please do not be offended! But we are ridiculous—and yet there is more to our eyes.]]></string>
<string id="523997"><![CDATA[More to our eyes?]]></string>
<string id="523998"><![CDATA[Our eyes speak true—no more than three days will pass before you and I turn from tiny creatures into two pillars carrying the burden of the supreme power… Unless we make mistakes—oh, I hope we never do! And so you will help me, will you not? Thus helping yourself... you do understand, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="523999"><![CDATA[Oh, so that's where you were going with this…]]></string>
<string id="524000"><![CDATA[But what exactly do you want?]]></string>
<string id="524001"><![CDATA[Why is she so terrible?]]></string>
<string id="524002"><![CDATA[She is strong and dangerous. She is stronger than me, for I create and she destroys. She does indeed—that is her nature! She doesn't heal, she merely kills the disease! You should see the ones she'd saved... She is stronger because she is made of lies; I, on the other hand, am the White Mistress, and so I am plain to see...]]></string>
<string id="524003"><![CDATA[Why does she need the kids?]]></string>
<string id="524004"><![CDATA[You are not a Mistress yet...]]></string>
<string id="524005"><![CDATA[But I shall be one soon, very soon! Think about it, Artemy. You do not know what it's like… when a freckled bare-legged nymph breaks apart, and a graceful alabaster swallowtail emerges in all its glory, its wings covering the people, its love engulfing the world...]]></string>
<string id="524006"><![CDATA[Yes! Help them, Artemy. And I will repay you. I am begging you now as a child, but you will have the gratitude of a Mistress. The change is bound to happen very, very soon. You know that the future is an open book to me. Help me attain power—and I will help you keep yours.]]></string>
<string id="524007"><![CDATA[I don't need power.]]></string>
<string id="524008"><![CDATA[But you need to win. Or don't you? Don't you feel obligated, clenched, trapped by fate? Oh, you do need to win! Else you will never become yourself. Let us help each other. Let us be noble and generous.]]></string>

<string id="524010"><![CDATA[I'll just do it for you, no need for gratitude.]]></string>

So they went to the Theatre, to its backyard—and disappeared… with all the kerosene! And that was the last we've seen of 'em. Could it be they've buried treasure, I wonder?]]></string>
<string id="524022"><![CDATA[No, I dont' think so.]]></string>
<string id="524023"><![CDATA[Yeah, I know. We scoured the place. Found nothin', neither hole nor ditch nor secret passage nor anything. But the Theatre is an evil place, it's got character… You've heard of the Prophet, right? The guy that's made a splash like the day before yesterday?]]></string>

<string id="524095"><![CDATA[Oh, a medicine like that would be extremely disadvantageous to Aglaya! Seems like that is something she should be striving to find, doesn't it?

<string id="524751"><![CDATA[But it is not of Georgiy that you should be wary. I feel that the Kain's plot was conceived in a different mind.

<string id="524965"><![CDATA[...And to turn back the wheel that is about to crush us. Yes, this is my last hope. Perhaps at least you are master of your fate? Even Simon cannot boast this title now…]]></string>
<string id="524966"><![CDATA[How would you reward me if in ten days' time these people were still alive? Would you go with me to the Capital?]]></string>
<string id="524967"><![CDATA[Of course I can.]]></string>
<string id="524968"><![CDATA[I'm only staying here for a day or two anyway.]]></string>
<string id="524969"><![CDATA[Please refer to Eva Yan with such ideas, Bachelor. She will gladly go to the Capital with you—just remind her to slip into something before she leaves the premises of her house. Well, don't let it go to your head. I will probably be able to reward you... in my own way. You won't be disappointed.]]></string>
<string id="524970"><![CDATA[Let's go back to the people you worry about—even though I cannot say I share your anxiety. You've failed to scare me.]]></string>
<string id="524971"><![CDATA[No, Maria, I can't take on a responsibility this huge. I'm sorry.]]></string>
<string id="524972"><![CDATA[You shouldn't speak badly about Eva. She offered me room and board and was very welcoming.]]></string>
<string id="524973"><![CDATA[I have no doubts about that; you were the only thing she could babble about for the last few days. It does you credit to stand up for her though. I respect that and will not mock her in your presence again.]]></string>
<string id="524974"><![CDATA[Yes, please be so kind.]]></string>
<string id="524975"><![CDATA[Forget it.]]></string>
<string id="524976"><![CDATA[Bound?]]></string>
<string id="524979"><![CDATA[There is a tight spring of power within each of these people. Each of them can break the routine of human existence and become something greater. They are standing on the verge of their humanity, gazing into the realm where they could serve a different, higher purpose—without even knowing it. Moreover, they are bound to make the leap—in one way or another. That's why we call them simply the Bound.]]></string>
<string id="524981"><![CDATA[But how is their fate… bound to mine? Did you say my victory depended on them? How?]]></string>
<string id="524982"><![CDATA[I don't know. I'm not a Mistress yet. The future is not as clear to me as I would prefer; but I can feel the present. I can already distinguish a dubious guess from the pulse of the precise knowledge devoid of words and images. These people are bound to you. Your lives are connected. I wouldn't have asked you to take care of them otherwise.]]></string>
<string id="524983"><![CDATA[All right. If it is truly within my power, I'll do my best to save their lives.]]></string>
<string id="524984"><![CDATA[Are you clairvoyant or something?]]></string>
<string id="524985"><![CDATA[Ah, yes... you haven't been told, have you? It didn't even cross my mind that someone may be unaware of my abilities. No one here dares doubt them—for they are evident. Yes, the Mistress of every ruling house possesses special abilities. I am learning to see the future and transform the present.]]></string>
<string id="524986"><![CDATA[Forgive me, but I don't believe in this type of phenomenons.]]></string>
<string id="524987"><![CDATA[This fact offers your words a different degree of authenticity.]]></string>
<string id="524988"><![CDATA[Will you comply with my request? Will you save the lives of the people I name to you? Answer me… before going back to Eva.]]></string>
<string id="524989"><![CDATA[No, Maria. I need to go back to the Capital as soon as possible.]]></string>
<string id="524990"><![CDATA[You sound delusional. I'm sorry, but your uncle's death has messed with your head. You need to come to your senses.]]></string>

<string id="524992"><![CDATA[When and how are these people supposed to die?]]></string>
<string id="524993"><![CDATA["Bound to die." No need to shy away from it. That is also implied.]]></string>
<string id="524994"><![CDATA[You didn't answer my question, Maria. How and when will they die?]]></string>
<string id="524996"><![CDATA[How do you know that Eva had asked me to come back?]]></string>
<string id="524997"><![CDATA[I know Eva. She wants to safeguard you from my nocturnal intrigues, doesn't she? She strives to touch the mysteries of our family... to learn the game we're playing. Well, talk to her. Perhaps you two will manage to uncover some bits and pieces of the Kains' dark conspiracy against humanity. But you haven't given me an answer. What will it be?]]></string>
<string id="524998"><![CDATA[I will do as you ask, Maria. My honour bids me to. And you'd be better off not giving me cheek. You won't like me when I'm angry.]]></string>
<string id="524999"><![CDATA[No. I don't want to… bind myself with an unnecessary promise.]]></string>
<string id="525035"><![CDATA[Any interesting news?]]></string>
<string id="525036"><![CDATA[People say all sorts of things over a bottle! They say no one has ever seen a shabnak, but she's been heard. Heard by prophets, drunkards, housemates, and those who happened to walk past the Crucible that night. I wonder what the bastards were doing there! They probably wanted to get another glimpse of lovely Maria in the window!]]></string>
<string id="525037"><![CDATA[What did they hear?]]></string>
<string id="525038"><![CDATA[They've heard a wheeze, heard sobbing and breathing—very heavy, as if it were a whale. Those are apparent signs of the hair-eater. Here and there; by the window, by the wall; behind the corner. Scared shitless, people then come here to forget themselves and the nightmare.]]></string>
<string id="525039"><![CDATA[Breathing so heavy that it can be heard through walls? Well, that whale hasn't got much time left. I'm telling you this as a doctor.]]></string>
<string id="525040"><![CDATA[It's possible. It's also possible that twyrine addiction goes hand in hand with poetry. Poetic minds tend to exaggerate things. But are they really so deprived of imagination that they have to tell the same tale over and over again? That's the concern that's gnawing at me... ]]></string>
<string id="525041"><![CDATA[Curious.]]></string>
<string id="525042"><![CDATA[You can hear things like that at any corner.]]></string>
<string id="525043"><![CDATA[That's what's troubling me. If there's a ruthless killer hiding at every corner, then it's time to take to arms!]]></string>
<string id="525044"><![CDATA[It is. Do you know where I could get a weapon?]]></string>
<string id="525045"><![CDATA[I do, Bachelor, but it's an issue that should only be brought up when you're fresh as a daisy. Guns are prohibited here. As you can see, our morals are quite peaceful. Need I make an example? Just take the Bone Stake Lot!]]></string>
<string id="525046"><![CDATA[...]]></string>
<string id="525047"><![CDATA[Let's wait until nightfall.]]></string>
<string id="525048"><![CDATA[Perhaps. And perhaps the bottle divers are accessory to the murder themselves? The disease is there, true, but…]]></string>
<string id="525049"><![CDATA[No, old boy. It's not their idiocy that makes them go looking for the shabnak. No man can enter Focus. I'm telling you this as a professional and a legitimate architect. My idea of what is and is not possible is rather uncommon too, trust me. Still, no man could have gotten to Simon there.]]></string>
<string id="525050"><![CDATA[All right. So what are your drinking buddies saying?]]></string>
<string id="525164"><![CDATA[Everyone is after a female figure. What is this, the vestiges of matriarchy? The Snake Mother, the abyss, yadda yadda?]]></string>
<string id="525165"><![CDATA[Hmm. Actually, an unusual girl's been walking around our town lately. Did you know? They say she can work miracles with her bare hands. If I happen to meet her, I'll test her miraculous capabilities. She can probably ease my headache, right?]]></string>
<string id="525166"><![CDATA[One more paranormalist... The concentration of anomalies on such a small piece of land is beyond my comprehension.]]></string>
<string id="525167"><![CDATA[She heals the sick and incapacitated. Perhaps she's a healer, perhaps a saint, and perhaps she's just a fraud. I like to believe she's a saint; the world around us is rather low on miracles.]]></string>
<string id="525168"><![CDATA[She's a fraud for sure.]]></string>
<string id="525169"><![CDATA[Things like this happen, but science is unable to explain them.]]></string>

<string id="525171"><![CDATA[You seem to be depressed too.]]></string>
<string id="525172"><![CDATA[The Dream Mistresses are silent. This is both sad and strange... Quite! Sad and strange. Even lady Katerina won't bestow her poisonous psalms upon us.]]></string>
<string id="525173"><![CDATA[Tell me about the Dream Mistresses, Peter.]]></string>
<string id="525174"><![CDATA[...Mistresses used to have some inexplicable, magnetic, motherly power over us. Katerina's problem is that she's a turncoat. You can't just stop in your tracks between the ridge and the abyss; you have to either climb or fall. Falling is easy; climbing is commendable.]]></string>
<string id="525175"><![CDATA[What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="525176"><![CDATA[Nothing, really. She's a false Mistress. That is what bothers me. She doesn't have the right to see things. Seriously, my twyrine daydreams are better suited to change our life—because I am at least honest with myself and true to my conscience! I've never betrayed anyone. All my life I've only been doing the things that I believed to be true creative work!]]></string>
<string id="525177"><![CDATA[Change? I thought the clairvoyants see the inevitable.]]></string>
<string id="525178"><![CDATA[We don't have clairvoyants any longer. We are orphans. Blind puppies in the darkness. Yeah… ]]></string>

<string id="525225"><![CDATA[Root]]></string>
<string id="525226"><![CDATA[I spent the night in thought and recollection, trying to trace the logic of the supernatural retribution that has befallen our community. It has been revealed to my wife that there is a creature among us who is to blame for all that is happening. I've gone through a list of possible suspects. I have it here in front of me. Every one of these people could turn out to be the criminal, the one that brought this disaster down upon us.]]></string>
<string id="525227"><![CDATA[But how am I supposed to do it, father? ... I can call you that now, right?]]></string>
<string id="525228"><![CDATA[First of all, you must gain the trust of the person I believe to be the criminal responsible for this. Anyone would find the task complicated and demanding—except for you; since all you have to do is to predict the slightest movement of their—ehm—their soul. Do something for them; raise their spirits; astonish them; surely you can.]]></string>
<string id="525229"><![CDATA[Yes, father. I'll do my duty.]]></string>
<string id="525231"><![CDATA[Let justice prevail. Mercy to the innocent; a reckoning to the guilty.]]></string>

<string id="525233"><![CDATA[Really? Well then, godspeed. Aspity is standing in your way, and woe is her if she is guilty. And should she keep mum, Vlad the Younger will gladly show you the shortest way into the depth of her dark soul. Your path is blessed, Clara. Go.]]></string>

<string id="525237"><![CDATA[I'm beginning to like you... When I look at you I get this strange feeling that you're the closest person I have in the world. It's like a spell.]]></string>
<string id="525238"><![CDATA[Could you tell me about Aspity then? You know who that is, right?]]></string>
<string id="525239"><![CDATA[How could I not! A most interesting person. So you've met her already? That was quick... What do you need her for?]]></string>
<string id="525240"><![CDATA[So you believe she's an avenger? An embodiment of divine retribution? Isn't that too grand a role for her?]]></string>
<string id="525241"><![CDATA[No... I saw her just a little while ago. Can't forget her eyes. Languid, but also very keen and intent. Sardonic. And before that, she used to act as if I didn't exist. She preferred to curse my father, threatening to ruin him. It's all really, really strange...]]></string>
<string id="525242"><![CDATA[Yes, it would do good to speak with him. That's where I can find a hook…]]></string>

<string id="525253"><![CDATA[...Listen here, nimble darling. If you really want to have a nice conversation with me, then bring me Burakh. Know who that is? I see you do... I can't leave my house now, and he needs me badly!]]></string>

<string id="525281"><![CDATA[It will pass, Aspity. It will.]]></string>

<string id="525299"><![CDATA[Ah... Flowers! So beautiful, too... thank you! How did you know? Those are exactly the ones I wanted to offer Farkhad... He likes the colour red... Perhaps you're fond of them too?]]></string>

<string id="525311"><![CDATA[I can't, I'm busy right now... see these unburied bones? Seen that half-dug pit outside? I'm sorry, but I have a lot of things to take care of...]]></string>

<string id="525317"><![CDATA[Why? I do want to take part! Do I have to donate some money?]]></string>
<string id="525318"><![CDATA[...I'm not prepared to put you in charge of supplies for The House of the Living, but there is a way you can help. The Harpist has gone off to take a look at an empty house—and hasn't come back yet. If he's still there, tell him to come back here as soon as possible; I can't keep up without him. ]]></string>
<string id="525319"><![CDATA[Just that? Your trust seems easy to earn…]]></string>
<string id="525320"><![CDATA[Not as easy as all that. If you do a good deed seeking no gain, it will at least be clear that you're not the shabnak-adyr. A demon cannot do good. Then I'll be able to rely on you instead of the Bachelor, who I dislike. I feel that he'll do with that money as he sees fit—we're less than human as far as he's concerned.]]></string>
<string id="525321"><![CDATA[Won't it make him cross with me?]]></string>
<string id="525322"><![CDATA[It's up to you. Either you want to become a keeper of The House of the Living, or you don't. I can't spend the money anyway without the Harpist's approval.]]></string>

<string id="525657"><![CDATA[The Haruspex has asked me to keep his whereabouts a secret. Someone is trying to track him down. This means there is something that he is afraid of after all... I wonder what I should say to the Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="525658"><![CDATA[*** I decided not to surrender the Haruspex to the Bachelor. Their ardent feud may be of use one day. As long as the two keep one another in check, they are no threat to me. Besides, I get the feeling they both may prove helpful to my cause one day...]]></string>
<string id="525659"><![CDATA[*** I have surrendered the Haruspex to the Bachelor. I wonder which one of them is going to have the upper hand? One of them will be hurt, this much is clear, and anything that may weaken my enemies will make me stronger.]]></string>
<string id="525660"><![CDATA[The Bachelor was unable to recover the necessary antibodies from human blood. The panacea can't be made from this kind of material. It's time to try the same with the bulls. In truth, we should have started with them to begin with, though it is nearly impossible to find one these days. Most of the cows were slaughtered to prevent a famine. I wonder if even a single animal was left alive?]]></string>

<string id="525665"><![CDATA[To recover the antibodies from the blood of a bull, we will have to infect it first. To do this we will need an already infected organ. The Bachelor thinks that a heart would suit best.]]></string>
<string id="525666"><![CDATA[*** It seems that a panacea can't even be made from the blood of a beast. Tomorrow will tell, but I have a bad feeling about it. The Bachelor is convinced that the experiment was a failure.]]></string>
<string id="525667"><![CDATA[No need to wait too long; the infection progresses rapidly. I can take the blood of this bull to the Bachelor for further study.]]></string>
<string id="525668"><![CDATA[This is the Short Block of the Termitary. Tycheek's daughter is waiting for me there. How does a little girl like her handle the horrors of an epidemic?]]></string>

<string id="525685"><![CDATA[Why, I've heard the stories... About a lass on the run from the Law, ready to have her head rollin' without mercy—and the conviction's just that: theft... I respect that.

<string id="525686"><![CDATA[Theft is not a sin anymore. It's forgivable now. Yet you're no thief, but quite unequivocally a killer. And that is not forgivable.]]></string>
<string id="525687"><![CDATA[Eh, livin' the thievin'... I've got myself a lad who can vouch for me all right. He's the best kind of advocate man could have, too, 'cause he's my enemy. The lil' prick never misses a chance to smear my honest thief's name in more dirt. It's that pesky lil' punk, Notkin. Had it in for me since forever. Keeps settin' his whelps on me too—'n they have a nose for our lot's sins, and won't let any go unnoted. Ask him, then, if I'm a killer.]]></string>

<string id="525693"><![CDATA[They're benefitting from the outbreak, that much is true. You see, there's this little-known fact. It could all be because of the twyrine peddled by the thieves.

<string id="525926"><![CDATA[If Katerina is to be believed, it's all your fault! It was your pride that had brought all this upon us.]]></string>

And don't feel sorry for me and my brother... you see, I know for a fact that we won't be a burden on this angry earth for long... we'll soon drown in it... like in a swamp...]]></string>

<string id="525933"><![CDATA[You idiot! Unforgivable stupidity! Why talk to Andrey? Maria's paramour, a debauched murderer—he will not leave us alone anymore. He will begin to guard them now, like a cock guarding his roost! Hmm... this pain is unbearable, my temples are torn apart with hooks... You're useless... more useless by the day!]]></string>

<string id="525936"><![CDATA[Katerina's experiment yesterday did not bear fruit, but this was to be expected. Too many coincidences were working against us. It should be better today. Peter Stamatin, the most daring of builders, has a searing fire burning so brightly within him, yet his spirit is weak and the fire is all too easy to snuff out.]]></string>
<string id="525937"><![CDATA[Now, things become complicated. I will have to convert two instead of one; men as different from each other as they are similar. Neither of the two will lend me his ear unless the other approves. This will be challenging, as their mutual support will reinforce their dangerous misconceptions... Enough of that. I must approach Andrey. The sooner the better.]]></string>
<string id="525938"><![CDATA[It appears that father has decided to go ahead with the raid after all! I will have to go back to him and beg mercy for Andrey. This won't be an easy task, but then, Andrey will surely appreciate my assistance. Feelings of gratitude will make him easier to deal with... He won't be able to reject me as easily as he did before. Everything is going well.]]></string>
<string id="525939"><![CDATA[My gentle father will spare the architect! The twins will no longer refuse to open their souls to me! Andrey would know the news by now; he is bound to be on the way back to his den of debauchery...]]></string>
<string id="525940"><![CDATA[His words cut deep. He is a true fanatic; a knight of arrogance and impertinence. My mother was right to say: it is him and others like him that we have to blame for the pestilence. They are the ones who have caused it, and not the poor souls my father seeks out for persecution! Why do they persist? Can't they see the truth when it is right in front of them? ]]></string>
<string id="525941"><![CDATA[No, Peter sees it all; the truth splits in half; the world is falling. I walk upon both sides of the moonlit way, following two different paths at the same time! Do the Utopians dare mock the faith of Humility? We need to think deeper here. An immediate gain would not necessarily lead to long-term victory...]]></string>
<string id="525942"><![CDATA[*** What kind of a day is this? Did I do something wrong, that would cause them to change so much?

<string id="526060"><![CDATA[But what am I to do?]]></string>
<string id="526061"><![CDATA[Depends on who is asking. If you are innocent, you should seek out the Bachelor before he finds you himself. Speaking of which, a corpse was found yesterday... with its heart removed. A ghastly crime indeed, but the Bachelor... he figured out an absolutely scintillating way to use it to serve his own ends. He compares the blood he took from the corpse to the other blood specimens he has collected. So, if you are guilty, you may rest assured that this is all going to end soon.

<string id="526115"><![CDATA[The Bachelor went home. Shall I pay him a visit? Shall I talk to him? Nothing can happen that is worse than what has already transpired...]]></string>
<string id="526116"><![CDATA[*** It's all over, it seems... My mind struggles to understand this. Where is the harbinger now; who is the miracle-worker? Has the Changeling changed—or has the world? Were these six days filled with lies, or was there a grain of purest truth somewhere within? Hardly worth thinking about now. No choice but to wait until morning.]]></string>
<string id="526117"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="526118"><![CDATA[Well... looks like it's time. Get to the Cathedral. Beware of everybody on your way; hide from every shadow. When the Inquisitor receives you, speak only the truth. Not that you'll have another option…]]></string>
<string id="526119"><![CDATA[Thank you…]]></string>
<string id="526120"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor is always scarier than they look at first glance.]]></string>

<string id="526123"><![CDATA[You again? ]]></string>
<string id="526124"><![CDATA[I need to see the Inquisitor.]]></string>
<string id="526125"><![CDATA[So you've escaped? Don't tell me they let you walk... The orders were to hang you by the neck until dead.]]></string>
<string id="526126"><![CDATA[What was I arrested for?]]></string>
<string id="526127"><![CDATA[You are being hunted, aren't you? They did, however, get a bit ahead of themselves there… At least they should've announced you to the Inquisitor. Well... the good goons went out of their way to be useful. They had failed to catch the maneater back when they reported to Saburov, so they went for something quick and dirty this time...]]></string>
<string id="526128"><![CDATA[What can I do to keep my cover?]]></string>
<string id="526129"><![CDATA[Whatever. Stop pestering me. Although… I reckon the Inquisitor wouldn't mind talking to you—but until you've made your introduction, it's best to remain incognito.]]></string>
<string id="526130"><![CDATA[You know what? Give me your costume!]]></string>
<string id="526131"><![CDATA[No... There's no way I'm giving you mine. But I can tell you where to find another one like it. When Executors' cloaks become infected, they get dumped next to the large burial pit in Earth.]]></string>
<string id="526132"><![CDATA[Can I see the Inquisitor now?]]></string>
<string id="526133"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor is conducting an interrogation right now. Torturing the Kain elders. Come after noon. We'll see what comes out of your visit.]]></string>

<string id="526135"><![CDATA[Yes. Me again.]]></string>
<string id="526136"><![CDATA[Come in. But don't expect to get off scot-free, Changeling!]]></string>

<string id="526139"><![CDATA[Poor child... I was all indignation just a moment ago, but I feel only pity now. The things that happen in this land! Another victim of those deceiving bastards... Don't you know miracles are impossible?]]></string>
<string id="526140"><![CDATA[The Powers That Be could not have deceived me. I know what they're really worth.]]></string>
<string id="526141"><![CDATA[I know, I know, that's your sister. A twin, right? And an identical one. Impossible to tell apart from you. I wonder why I'm not seeing double like the others; why have you come here alone?]]></string>
<string id="526144"><![CDATA[...So what am I to do?]]></string>
<string id="526145"><![CDATA[I'll make up my mind by this evening, and that's if I like you. For now, you'll do what I tell you to. I'd like to see you alter the fabric of creation—or more exactly, I'd like to convince myself that you can do nothing of the sort; that you're a mere changeling rather than someone who incites the change.]]></string>
<string id="526146"><![CDATA[...What does that mean?]]></string>
<string id="526147"><![CDATA[You'll begin with the Saburovs. Do to them what they made you do to their subjects! Ask them. Find out how guilty they themselves think they are. True culprits are better than others at avoiding taking responsibility.]]></string>

<string id="526153"><![CDATA[I've come to you as an envoy of the Inquisitor.]]></string>
<string id="526154"><![CDATA[All right. Let's do it your way. But before I sign my own death warrant, I'd like you to find out a certain thing that greatly intrigues me... It won't save me—but perhaps it will help towards a better understanding of my motives.]]></string>
<string id="526155"><![CDATA[All right. I'll find out.]]></string>
<string id="526156"><![CDATA[The Bachelor won't be at home. He's searching for undercover agents—another thought-provoking detail, by the way—he's searching for undercover agents of the Powers That Be to turn over to the Inquisitor for execution. They've been hiding behind Executors' masks.]]></string>
<string id="526157"><![CDATA[I'll find him.]]></string>
<string id="526158"><![CDATA[One can both gain everything and lose everything in an instant.]]></string>
<string id="526159"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="526160"><![CDATA[So you did wiggle your way out of it, didn't you?]]></string>
<string id="526161"><![CDATA[I need to ask you an intimate question. Be honest; I'll find out eventually anyway. I'd just rather hear it from you.]]></string>
<string id="526162"><![CDATA[If that was supposed to frighten me—it didn't. It's not like you're ever going to think anything good of me, no matter what you hear and from whom. Listen up, plague girl. A matter of utmost importance is about to go to the dogs. This is why I'll trade my frankness for an Executor's mask.]]></string>
<string id="526163"><![CDATA[You're going to stab them with your beak, then dip your head into the bleeding wound and have a drink? Well... whatever. I'll get one for you.]]></string>
<string id="526165"><![CDATA[Is this what you wanted?]]></string>
<string id="526166"><![CDATA[That's one way to state the obvious.]]></string>
<string id="526167"><![CDATA[One of these?]]></string>
<string id="526168"><![CDATA[No! The Powers That Be are anxious to save the town; that's what matters to them, even though they've sent me on this blasphemous mission couched in charitable rhetoric! But I'm going to make them sorry for being so Jesuit about it! Especially with Aglaya insisting the town can't be saved.]]></string>
<string id="526169"><![CDATA[And where is the Haruspex now?]]></string>
<string id="526170"><![CDATA[I met him an hour ago; he was on his way to the Termitary, specifically to its "short block."]]></string>

<string id="526172"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="526173"><![CDATA[There's still hope. We're not giving up yet.]]></string>

<string id="526176"><![CDATA[Intuition. All right, I'll get the damn thing for you.]]></string>
<string id="526177"><![CDATA[I just did... Take it. And now answer my questions.]]></string>
<string id="526178"><![CDATA[Try it on. I hope it's not too tight.]]></string>
<string id="526179"><![CDATA[What did you want to ask me?]]></string>
<string id="526180"><![CDATA[I see. No further questions.]]></string>
<string id="526181"><![CDATA[There is no hope, Burakh. Just dead earth and cold ashes.]]></string>
<string id="526182"><![CDATA[I've fulfilled your request.]]></string>
<string id="526183"><![CDATA[Its development was gradual. That is the key to all that has happened. Each new addition grew out of the one before it, like branches on a tree. The fruit was too heavy; it broke the tree.]]></string>
<string id="526184"><![CDATA[...I will tell the Inquisitor of all that I've heard here.]]></string>
<string id="526185"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="526186"><![CDATA[Ah, it's you, daughter dear...]]></string>
<string id="526187"><![CDATA[What are you going to tell me now?]]></string>
<string id="526188"><![CDATA[Now... you will be my envoy to Maria Kaina. Tell Maria that I'm abdicating from my throne as a Mistress and bequeathing my position to another. Find out from her what Simon is saying about my successor as the Mistress of the Humble... She will not dare lie.]]></string>
<string id="526189"><![CDATA[I'll ask her.]]></string>
<string id="526190"><![CDATA[Aren't you forgetting something? It seems that you have no memory of yesterday. Must be the morphine…]]></string>
<string id="526191"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="526192"><![CDATA[Yes? What is it?]]></string>
<string id="526193"><![CDATA[Katerina has asked me to tell you that she's abdicating from her throne as a Mistress.]]></string>
<string id="526194"><![CDATA[Don't celebrate just yet. This town has another Mistress in the making. She may be a mere tot now, but I'm already more inclined to reckon with her than with you! Ask Capella the same thing you asked me. Ask her who Victoria wants to see replace Katerina.]]></string>
<string id="526195"><![CDATA[I'll do just that.]]></string>
<string id="526196"><![CDATA[Nothing.]]></string>
<string id="526197"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="526198"><![CDATA[Even your eyes keep changing colours…]]></string>
<string id="526199"><![CDATA[Tell me, you do speak with your mother, don't you? Maria is asking who Victoria would like to see as... the new Mistress.]]></string>
<string id="526200"><![CDATA[No. But mom did hint that owing to you, Simon survives and is regaining life. Do you hear me? This means Katerina must name you as her successor. Is she relinquishing power?]]></string>
<string id="526201"><![CDATA[She won't make that mistake. I can vouch for that.]]></string>
<string id="526202"><![CDATA[Whatever the colour, they still see that you don't trust me…]]></string>
<string id="526203"><![CDATA[I'm back, Katerina. I've asked about the Mistress-to-be.]]></string>
<string id="526204"><![CDATA[It is... I know it for sure now. I lied... and was lied to. This Rat Prophet, the creature from my dreams, was the spawn of my lies. So there, I have betrayed everyone's trust. I must go.]]></string>
<string id="526205"><![CDATA[I don't need that at all!]]></string>
<string id="526206"><![CDATA[I believe in you. Saving people is your calling. Yes, you've been a bringer of death... But isn't it true that sometimes to save is to release? For this world, healing is death. Such is the logic of the Law. The disease is treating the sore upon the world. You are a Mistress. Have no doubt of that. Rule wisely. And farewell.]]></string>
<string id="526207"><![CDATA[I'll tell the Inquisitor of what I've heard here.]]></string>
<string id="526208"><![CDATA[I've fulfilled the task you gave me.]]></string>
<string id="526209"><![CDATA[My dear child... No matter what you did, I would draw the correct conclusions. No one's taken your freedom away from you. You can refuse if you like; you can attempt to escape. And even if you succeed at it, it won't mean my defeat. All I want is to understand your role in this world.]]></string>
<string id="526210"><![CDATA[I don't quite understand…]]></string>
<string id="526211"><![CDATA[So here's my first question. What's to be done about the Saburovs? This doll-house family that has been audacious enough to think they can rule over a human settlement as it's experiencing its ultimate catastrophe? A family whose actions have led to the deaths of several thousand people?]]></string>
<string id="526212"><![CDATA[Let them perish. They deserve it.]]></string>
<string id="526213"><![CDATA[No! Just don't do anything to them. They are so unhappy! And it's not their fault…]]></string>
<string id="526214"><![CDATA[The Executors did their work here, no doubt. This is where they brought their gruesome harvest. Perhaps some of them even died here tonight…]]></string>
<string id="526215"><![CDATA["Vengeance"]]></string>
<string id="526216"><![CDATA[Who would have thought that I would return to this house as a harbinger... and a judge! Everything is head over heels. Fate plays with us in mischievous ways.]]></string>
<string id="526217"><![CDATA[Who could tell me where exactly the Bachelor is searching for the Executors? He must have visited the Theatre... They will know where he went.]]></string>
<string id="526218"><![CDATA[Even more victims to suffer under the sword of this merciless demon. He stalks them, approaching secretly, as if he were one of their own... This horrible mask would fit him well. It's as though it were created just for him! I will bring it to him!]]></string>
<string id="526219"><![CDATA[Burakh is on to some dirty work in the Termitary. With the number of dead bodies in there, I'm sure he is thriving. However, he knows something about the Inquisitor, something even the Bachelor is oblivious of. I need to find him.]]></string>
<string id="526220"><![CDATA[Birds of a feather... Burakh has donned the garb of a death messenger as well. Everything has hastened towards its most logical outcome! I hope it concerns me too, even though I will surely come out better than them all!]]></string>
<string id="526221"><![CDATA[I know everything now. I can return to my father now, he is waiting in the Rod.]]></string>
<string id="526222"><![CDATA[The hardest is yet to come. What is Katerina going to say to me? Can I still call her mother after she has rejected me?]]></string>
<string id="526223"><![CDATA[Once again I have to visit Maria. I am no longer afraid, for I feel that her and Capella are soon to become the only ones alive who will share in my all-encompassing loneliness. Or was an end such as this chosen by Katerina? I wouldn't know.]]></string>
<string id="526224"><![CDATA[It's time to see Capella. I wouldn't say I didn't see it coming. Sooner or later, everything comes to a head... Is it too late now to step away from this path? For me it is. The road goes all the way downhill and I am moving at such a speed that were I to stop, I would break apart.]]></string>
<string id="526225"><![CDATA[How unexpected... It was but a moment ago that I trembled in anticipation of Capella's decision... I was afraid I would have to wear this fearsome crown. But I am no longer afraid! She told me something that halted my descent. I am at the crossroads again.]]></string>
<string id="526226"><![CDATA[There, now I saw them. I never expected to see anything of this kind in the Rod. What am I going to say to Aglaya? I should make a decision on my way to the Cathedral.]]></string>
<string id="526227"><![CDATA[*** So be it. They are guilty. They have surrendered me to the slaughter, but this is not the cause of their guilt. They are guilty of being possessed by evil; guilty of causing harm to the place they lived; guilty of seducing the others with their false truths and guilty of condemning those who deserved nothing but to be forgiven. There is no way back for them and no one will comfort them...]]></string>
<string id="526228"><![CDATA[*** They are not guilty, even if it was them who surrendered me to the slaughter. Even though they were possessed by evil; caused great harm to the place they lived; seduced the others with their false truths and condemned those who deserved to be forgiven. For all this, I will not be their judge. I will try to redress what they have done.]]></string>
<string id="526229"><![CDATA[Dear me... And what was I doing in there?]]></string>
<string id="526230"><![CDATA[And why are you standing here with these horrible masks on your faces... Has something happened?]]></string>
<string id="526231"><![CDATA[I'll figure it out, beakhead! Go away and don't bother me anymore.]]></string>
<string id="526232"><![CDATA[Why do you need to rub it in?]]></string>
<string id="526233"><![CDATA[He hasn't.]]></string>
<string id="526234"><![CDATA[Most importantly, don't forget to stop by the caretaker's lodge. You've got people awaiting you there, and they have no doubts about your identity. As it happens, they've just drawn proof of your arrival from a pile of oracle bones... Your turning up in person will duly impress them. Tarry not.]]></string>
<string id="526235"><![CDATA[Careful! Don't scratch me with that beak of yours.]]></string>
<string id="526236"><![CDATA[It is no beak, my dear child. It is a talon! For what I really am is a finger—of a hand!]]></string>
<string id="526237"><![CDATA[You should be that much more careful if it's a talon.]]></string>
<string id="526238"><![CDATA[I'll remember to do that, kindly teacher. Thank you...]]></string>
<string id="526239"><![CDATA[Me? I'm not much of a teacher... More like your faithful servant. I'm here because of you, you know. It's you who are the kindly teacher.]]></string>
<string id="526240"><![CDATA[As you wish.]]></string>
<string id="526241"><![CDATA[Essentially, this is it for now. Don't forget to stop by the caretaker's lodge. Awaiting you there is Katerina, who will be a better mentor and support than myself in these difficult first days. You're lucky to have her on your side—being as she is a Mistress, as well as wife to our ruler, the fearsome Alexander.]]></string>
<string id="526242"><![CDATA[Very lucky indeed!]]></string>
<string id="526243"><![CDATA[I don't need your advice. I think I'm familiar with eating. You open your mouth and go "nom."]]></string>
<string id="526244"><![CDATA[I'm so tired, it's as if I've been sleepwalking all night...]]></string>
<string id="526245"><![CDATA[So what am I to do?]]></string>
<string id="526246"><![CDATA[You can take anything you want at the mansions of those destined for the leading roles in this unfolding drama: such is the custom of hospitality with the local aristocracy and those who try to imitate them.]]></string>
<string id="526247"><![CDATA[You can spot a shop by its sign. They're for selling useless items as well as buying useful ones. And some of the people in the street will gladly barter things they wouldn't sell you for money. There's illicit trade going on at a couple of secret spots—but a lady so young would be wise not to set foot in those dens. Or, for that matter, talk about them.]]></string>
<string id="526248"><![CDATA[So there are things no one would sell me, right?]]></string>
<string id="526249"><![CDATA[Pinching? As in stealing? Won't they give me some if I ask politely?]]></string>
<string id="526250"><![CDATA[Thank you, Mask. I don't need you anymore.]]></string>
<string id="526251"><![CDATA[Do you recognize me, Katerina? I recognized you at once.]]></string>
<string id="526252"><![CDATA[My wife Katerina said you had been seen at the cemetery. The late caretaker's daughter claims that you had crawled out of a fresh grave, the appearance of which could not be accounted for. Is this true?]]></string>
<string id="526253"><![CDATA[Yes. I awoke in an earthen pit. It didn't look like a grave. Just a pit in the middle of a cemetery... But that's not a crime, is it?]]></string>
<string id="526254"><![CDATA[What? How could she possibly have talked to you already?]]></string>
<string id="526255"><![CDATA[At least half of what you've said is true.]]></string>
<string id="526256"><![CDATA[So you're the cemetery caretaker. Don't worry, I won't do you any harm.]]></string>
<string id="526257"><![CDATA[My, you're so pretty! What's your name?]]></string>
<string id="526259"><![CDATA[Anna. Anna Angel. When I was small, it's what they called me for my beautiful singing voice. And what's your name?]]></string>
<string id="526260"><![CDATA[My name is Clara. Don't be scared of me.]]></string>
<string id="526261"><![CDATA[Clara. I didn't get any nicknames when I was a child, because I couldn't sing at all.]]></string>
<string id="526262"><![CDATA[…You do look like a regular human being on the outside.]]></string>
<string id="526263"><![CDATA[There's so much anguish in your eyes, so much pain…]]></string>
<string id="526264"><![CDATA[I'd like to help—if my help is needed here, of course... I can work miracles.]]></string>
<string id="526265"><![CDATA[That's not uncommon around here. And do you know that a person greatly resembling you in appearance is wanted for murder committed by supernatural means?]]></string>
<string id="526266"><![CDATA[I'm not who you're looking for. See, I've even come to you of my own accord…]]></string>
<string id="526267"><![CDATA[I do. But don't be in a hurry to call the guards. I'm not guilty, and there's proof of that!]]></string>
<string id="526268"><![CDATA[So it must be my twin sister. I've followed her into this town.]]></string>
<string id="526269"><![CDATA[Perhaps you've seen my sister? We look exactly like each other.]]></string>
<string id="526270"><![CDATA[I know who you are. I just can't quite get a grasp of your essence. Where people have a soul, you have a black pit. What name have you chosen for yourself?]]></string>
<string id="526271"><![CDATA[Why are you saying such hurtful things? What have I ever done to you?]]></string>
<string id="526272"><![CDATA[I've chosen the name Clara. Same as my sister's.]]></string>
<string id="526273"><![CDATA[I've come from the Steppe.]]></string>

<string id="526279"><![CDATA[Immortal Simon... Sometimes I think I did... I don't understand anything!]]></string>

<string id="526283"><![CDATA[Have pity... I'm frightened enough as it is.]]></string>
<string id="526284"><![CDATA[Let it be Clara. I've come to this town... looking for my sister. Yes, I'm looking for my sister. Something's telling me she has recently paid you a visit.]]></string>
<string id="526285"><![CDATA[Go, I will follow. Perhaps I will be at The Rod even before you get there.]]></string>
<string id="526286"><![CDATA[You won't... I move very quickly.]]></string>
<string id="526287"><![CDATA[And how will I find your house?]]></string>
<string id="526288"><![CDATA[No, it's not clay.]]></string>
<string id="526289"><![CDATA[The Rod is in the Tanners district. It stands upon a cape, where the Gullet flows into the Gorkhon. Head north-west and don't cross any bridges. You can tell our house by the tall tower.]]></string>
<string id="526290"><![CDATA[I'll find it.]]></string>
<string id="526291"><![CDATA[Yes, that is right... I have been waiting for you… Clara. We have many things to talk about.]]></string>
<string id="526292"><![CDATA[Ask me and I will answer.]]></string>
<string id="526293"><![CDATA[And why have you been waiting for me? Please do tell me!]]></string>
<string id="526296"><![CDATA[Are you in danger?]]></string>
<string id="526297"><![CDATA[Yes. The bones say we are in a danger the likes of which have not been seen on this earth. Go to our house, Clara. If you are who we have been waiting for, you will have no trouble getting there, and no-one will threaten you on your way.]]></string>
<string id="526298"><![CDATA[And what are they saying?]]></string>
<string id="526299"><![CDATA[They're saying they've already vacated seven of the nine corners of their house for the guests that are due. All of the house's inhabitants are now crammed into the remaining two corners. Can you imagine the harvest that death is about to reap?]]></string>
<string id="526300"><![CDATA[Are those their bones you've got before you?]]></string>
<string id="526301"><![CDATA[No. These bones belong to the children of Suok. Legend says that a shard of Bos Turokh's rib is hidden among them, but no one knows which exact bone is his. With these bones, we draw the lines that carry words from the house of the dead.]]></string>
<string id="526302"><![CDATA[What words have the dead chosen this time?]]></string>

<string id="526304"><![CDATA[And my lady doesn't want to believe it! She says the future can be changed. This is her pity talking... Where did you come from? I thought you were going to stay at Grandfather's—you only went there yesterday evening, after all…]]></string>
<string id="526305"><![CDATA[Shhh! Be quiet! I don't know anything about a Grandfather... Got it?]]></string>

<string id="526308"><![CDATA[You're making it up. I'm the only me in this world.]]></string>
<string id="526309"><![CDATA[It must have been my sister.]]></string>
<string id="526310"><![CDATA[Who was that scary man?]]></string>
<string id="526311"><![CDATA[He is of Warden stock; he knows the lines of the body. He can heal people and is allowed to cut a body. He said his name was Artemy Burakh. But I'm afraid he'll kill the wounded man instead of healing him... The workman was, after all, his enemy; he'd attacked Burakh in the morning and injured him.]]></string>
<string id="526312"><![CDATA[And where is this Burakh's den?]]></string>
<string id="526313"><![CDATA[I don't know, but I think it must be nearby. He was in a bad state himself, so he couldn't have walked too far with a limp body on his hands. Hiding at the Works perhaps? Or at the runaway hospice... But now that I think of it, his shoes were covered in grey clay, which you only get around the Works.]]></string>
<string id="526315"><![CDATA[Why, then, are you being called a thief? I do believe larcenous skills are the exclusive domain of the wicked.]]></string>
<string id="526316"><![CDATA[It's actually the other way round! My hands have the gift of healing. I can cure the most terrible diseases with my hands. I've cured cancer. I even brought someone back from the dead once. Everyone said I'd made a miracle happen.]]></string>
<string id="526317"><![CDATA[Indeed... You are a miracle-worker. That makes you almost a saint. Yes, a status like that precludes accusations of murder and theft. But then explain to me the meaning of those coincidences! If not for my blind faith in my wife's words, I would have no doubt that you are an evil spirit, a spawn of the netherworld. And if you don't explain that mystery at once—I swear even Katerina's influence will not save you!]]></string>
<string id="526318"><![CDATA[Wait! I'll tell you. I have a twin sister. She looks exactly like me, is named the same, and wears the same clothes! I fear that she was the one who committed all those horrible crimes...]]></string>

<string id="526325"><![CDATA[The Kains are the family with which everything began here. Their radiant blood has preserved the memory of ancient magic since the time of the epics. They are the descendants of heroes who had fashioned the world out of their own flesh, who had created talking beasts and stretched chains of fire from sea to sea and built sky-high towers in a single night...]]></string>
<string id="526326"><![CDATA[Why are you telling me all this?]]></string>
<string id="526327"><![CDATA[The town is now governed by the Saburov-Olgimsky-Kain triumvirate. I fear that driven by their desire to avenge Simon, the Kains could try to shift the balance of power. Their tyranny would usher in an era of madness. I don't want that to happen. But I need to be sure before I can confront the Kains. And that is where you can help me.]]></string>

<string id="526333"><![CDATA[Simon Kain. The oldest and wisest of us. The spiritual mentor and founder of our community. Don't dodge the question. The charge is serious. But for my wife's firm faith in you, I would have handed you over to the Kains without a moment's hesitation.]]></string>

<string id="526342"><![CDATA[The head of one of the ruling families died last night. His murderer is said to be a woman similar to you in appearance. The description largely matches.

<string id="526343"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="526344"><![CDATA[You will go to The Crucible. It is in the upper part of town, called the Stone Yard.

If you succeed, I will reward you generously, Clara.]]></string>
<string id="526345"><![CDATA[Yes, that's right. I ask directly if they consent, and their mind approaches mine only if they say yes. Also I must know the person's real name and a secret fact from their life.]]></string>
<string id="526346"><![CDATA[You do, however, need more than just to look into a person's eyes in order to make them speak the truth and answer your every question? You need their consent?]]></string>

<string id="526348"><![CDATA[I would rely on Katerina's testimony entirely if I were a common man instead of one of the town's rulers and an heir to a family that has maintained order in this land for generations! Several thousand lives are my direct responsibility. Do you understand?]]></string>

<string id="526497"><![CDATA[There was no need…]]></string>
<string id="526498"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="526499"><![CDATA[I'm past being surprised to see you again at this point.]]></string>
<string id="526500"><![CDATA[Goodbye.]]></string>
<string id="526501"><![CDATA[Tell me, Burakh, where did Rubin get blood that was similar to Simon's?]]></string>
<string id="526502"><![CDATA[Do you know who the Bound are?]]></string>
<string id="526503"><![CDATA[Yes, I do.]]></string>
<string id="526504"><![CDATA[I've found out curious things about myself...]]></string>
<string id="526505"><![CDATA[We need the Polyhedron to become flesh for Simon's spirit. But a harrowing decision like this will come at a terrible price: we will have to say a final farewell to Nina, whose spirit resides there at the moment.]]></string>
<string id="526506"><![CDATA[That's impossible.]]></string>
<string id="526507"><![CDATA[The Polyhedron can work miracles. It exists in defiance of all laws, imaginable and otherwise. It's a miracle made real, the pinnacle of our legacy. The Utopia in the flesh. If it's destroyed, it will be lost for good. Nothing like it will ever be known to history.]]></string>
<string id="526508"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="526509"><![CDATA[It is capable of capturing a miracle. It captures the soul. It captures childhood. It feels like a world of eternal bliss to children who dwell within it. That's why they've set up their own republic there. And now it's your turn to speak. What was that blood the Bachelor was talking about?]]></string>
<string id="526510"><![CDATA[This scares me... I don't understand a thing... these destroyers, the Haruspex and the Bachelor, say that I was involved in the creation of that blood.]]></string>
<string id="526511"><![CDATA[If you and Rubin find the origin of the blood that holds a likeness to that of Simon's, then perhaps we may avoid having to banish Nina. It isn't Simon himself that we need—but the power of creation he wields. We live for its sake. Simon is not the Polyhedron's purpose; rather, Simon's purpose was to allow such Polyhedrons to spring up in this world.]]></string>
<string id="526512"><![CDATA[I'd like to convince myself personally.]]></string>
<string id="526519"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="526520"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="526521"><![CDATA[...So it's all about trickery to you? Wherever have you come from?]]></string>
<string id="526522"><![CDATA[Fains I!]]></string>
<string id="526523"><![CDATA[Now that's a surprise. Well then, come in. Do you wish to join us? Now of all times, when they've just rolled in that cannon? The mere sight of it would be enough to tear down five towns like ours. You astonish me.]]></string>
<string id="526524"><![CDATA[I'm not sure you're aware that I'm friends with Notkin.]]></string>
<string id="526525"><![CDATA[No, I detest trickery.]]></string>
<string id="526526"><![CDATA[But it could be dangerous!]]></string>
<string id="526527"><![CDATA[If you are truly the prophecied messenger from above, you have nothing to fear. Nothing will harm you. The murderer has fled. The whole town is searching for them. Wherever they are now, that place is far from the Station. Go and fear nothing.]]></string>
<string id="526528"><![CDATA[Yes, I do.]]></string>
<string id="526529"><![CDATA[And what if I don't succeed this time? After all, I can't control this power. It's coming from beyond.]]></string>
<string id="526530"><![CDATA[If not this time, then another time. Heal a man by nightfall for me—in the presence of a witness, or preferably witnesses. This will strengthen our position. I will then have legitimate grounds for protecting you against the Kains' wrath.]]></string>
<string id="526531"><![CDATA[You don't think my sister's guilty of this crime too?]]></string>
<string id="526532"><![CDATA[I have no idea what kind of a person your sister is and what her talents are. But it isn't likely. Even if your sister is as singular a creature as yourself, that carried the wrong signature. It was the work of a true ripper.]]></string>
<string id="526533"><![CDATA[And if the wounded man dies before I get to him?]]></string>
<string id="526534"><![CDATA[So now you have trust in me?]]></string>
<string id="526535"><![CDATA[I trusted you even before that. Do not be offended by these tests. What I do, I do not on my own behalf, but on behalf of the people entrusted to my care. I will most likely give you one more task; just allow me to pause and compose my mind first: I am considering what would be the best approach to the matter.]]></string>
<string id="526537"><![CDATA[Such arts are pertinent to demons, not humans—or rather, to half-human sorcerers who are part beast or part malicious element!]]></string>
<string id="526538"><![CDATA[I never said they were like that. I said they had descended from such... beings. It was a figure of speech. The Kains are every bit as human as the Saburovs. And yet there is still within them a spark of the flame that burned in deities and heroes born into a mythical era.]]></string>
<string id="526539"><![CDATA[Why have you brought them up?]]></string>
<string id="526540"><![CDATA[But you are a ruler. Why do you speak of the Kains as though they were more powerful than you?]]></string>
<string id="526547"><![CDATA[Well then... Go to Katerina. She will tell you about Georgiy. You are not, indeed, as simple as you seem. It is strange that you have revealed your secret to me. Have you not been tempted to use your skills on me?]]></string>
<string id="526548"><![CDATA[Why would I? You're helping me. So I have nothing to hide from you.]]></string>
<string id="526549"><![CDATA[I haven't revealed anything to you. I've just explained why I can't deceive you, so that you could trust me. I'll go to Katerina.]]></string>
<string id="526550"><![CDATA[You do, however, need more than just to look into a person's eyes in order to make them speak the truth and answer your every question? You need their consent?]]></string>
<string id="526561"><![CDATA[Have you heard the news about the plague already? The Bachelor has found the real murderer. An epidemic is spreading in the town. I feel the Kains will not be happy with this turn of events. So tell me one thing: did Georgiy know what his brother and patron died of?]]></string>
<string id="526562"><![CDATA[No. He's convinced that no natural cause could've possibly ended his brother's life. He's sure there is a murderer—however indirect their methods may be.]]></string>
<string id="526563"><![CDATA[I see. Sounds typical of him... Here's what all of it means: I am going to talk to the Bachelor. Now that the murderer has been found, no one will dare continue the search for the maneater... for a while. But the Kains will not abandon their version so easily. And there's another danger—the mob.]]></string>
<string id="526564"><![CDATA[A danger to whom?]]></string>
<string id="526565"><![CDATA[I suppose she is!]]></string>
<string id="526566"><![CDATA[It is possible, is it not, that she was the one who brought the disease into our town? Would you like to look for her?]]></string>
<string id="526567"><![CDATA[Maybe she is, maybe she isn't...]]></string>
<string id="526568"><![CDATA[I'll devote all of my time to this!]]></string>
<string id="526569"><![CDATA[You mean all of your spare time. Do you not realize how precarious your position is still? You have been cleared in my eyes, but people, both the commoners and the Bound, will require other evidence.]]></string>
<string id="526570"><![CDATA[That was just an introduction... You do have something important to tell me, right?]]></string>
<string id="526571"><![CDATA[The visions—they're not all the same. Some of them are clear, some are hazy. But a recent one was straightforward and vivid—a vision of such power that even a materialist would not question its divine provenience. I've had a vision of the chaos to come. Of the doom of all our creations. Of the earth swallowing our town.]]></string>
<string id="526572"><![CDATA[If it's all true, it's horrible…]]></string>
<string id="526573"><![CDATA[Yes, yes... That is correct. All that remains is to interpret that dream. A dream is always an allegory. Before I saw you, before I heard you speak, I had been thinking of other pairs of twins: Simon and Georgiy Kain, Andrey and Peter Stamatin... Even those visitors, the Haruspex and the Bachelor, had seemed to be the harbingers from my dream... But now I see where the truth lies.]]></string>
<string id="526574"><![CDATA[So you believe me?]]></string>
<string id="526576"><![CDATA[Now look here. Since you are holding the threads of life in your wondrous hands, I am going to entrust you with several people. They are all wicked people. Their souls are as black as soot. Each one of them is either an avowed evildoer, or hiding a sinister secret. You must take care of them.]]></string>
<string id="526577"><![CDATA[Agreed... If I'm able to do it, that is.]]></string>
<string id="526578"><![CDATA[And now hear me. All that I have told you is between you and I alone. Don't say a word about anything. Most importantly, keep it from my husband.]]></string>
<string id="526579"><![CDATA[I thought you had no secrets from each other…]]></string>
<string id="526580"><![CDATA[He is not his own master. He is a ruler. A man of duty. Two men are living inside him. It will drive him insane to find out that I have charged you with taking care of those who his duty dictates that he should suspect, indict, and execute. He trusts my premonitions too much.]]></string>
<string id="526581"><![CDATA[But what am I to do then?]]></string>
<string id="526582"><![CDATA[I am fully convinced that the prophecy was referring to you. But others will need better proof than that. Do as my husband said and prove that you are who I think you are... and we will stand by you. The ruling couple and the holy harbinger.]]></string>
<string id="526583"><![CDATA[What does that mean?]]></string>
<string id="526584"><![CDATA[It means that if you stand before our people in all your glory, fulfil your destiny, and don't abandon us afterwards, we will adopt you as our daughter. When I die, I will pass on to you the power of the Spirit. And your heart's chosen one will inherit the power of the Sword from my husband.]]></string>
<string id="526585"><![CDATA[I don't understand. Taking care of evildoers?]]></string>
<string id="526586"><![CDATA[If you are a kind angel, a holy miracle-worker sent to us from heaven, who else but you could discern some virtue inside their lost souls, convert them, redeem them, forgive them? But that is not the reason I am asking you to take care of them. There are many in our town who need to be purified. There are many worse villains than these. And yet these ones are special. Special to you, Clara...]]></string>
<string id="526587"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="526588"><![CDATA[Trust me. I know. I can see into the future. The sinners who I will now name will be of use to you in due time. In what way, I know not—but I know that they will be. The likelihood is fairly great... So make sure that they live—unless you should yourself see it more fit that they die. Is this agreed?]]></string>
<string id="526589"><![CDATA[Yes. I'll grant life to those who deserve to live. And I'll be the doom of those who must die…]]></string>
<string id="526590"><![CDATA[I want to serve both of you equally.]]></string>
<string id="526591"><![CDATA[You can never misstep, for every action you take is governed by supreme justice. Decide as your nature tells you. Listen to your feelings.]]></string>
<string id="526592"><![CDATA[All right. Have it your way.]]></string>
<string id="526593"><![CDATA[I can't promise you anything, but I'll be mindful of your request. May I have a look at them?]]></string>
<string id="526595"><![CDATA[I would call a person by their real name twice and say the words, "Such-and-such, I know of you this… Will you agree to touch me? To brave the depths? To answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?" If the answer's yes, then it's done.]]></string>
<string id="526598"><![CDATA[Why "I know of you this"? It feels like a part of the phrase is omitted…]]></string>
<string id="526599"><![CDATA[It is! You really have to know a secret about the person, which it would stun them to hear. But the secret must be true, of course. For example, you can say: "Anna, oh Anna, I know of you this: you've kidnapped a child!"]]></string>
<string id="526600"><![CDATA[What is that supposed to mean? Why did you say that?]]></string>
<string id="526601"><![CDATA[That's just an example. Do you know any secrets concerning Georgiy Kain?]]></string>
<string id="526605"><![CDATA[Yes, I will teach you... First of all, call him Judge. Do not call him Georgiy at first. The Kains are clever and he may immediately become suspicious. If you want to stun him with a secret... try to say, "You never loved Simon, and you are no twin of his." He will be taken aback.]]></string>
<string id="526606"><![CDATA[Thank you. Thank you!]]></string>
<string id="526610"><![CDATA[What for?]]></string>
<string id="526611"><![CDATA[That's how I unlock a soul.]]></string>
<string id="526613"><![CDATA[Yes, that's right. I ask directly if they consent, and their mind approaches mine only if they say yes. Also I must know the person's real name and a secret fact from their life.]]></string>
<string id="526614"><![CDATA[What for?]]></string>
<string id="526615"><![CDATA[That's how I unlock a soul.]]></string>
<string id="526616"><![CDATA[Well then... Go to Katerina. She will tell you about Georgiy. You are not, indeed, as simple as you seem. It is strange that you have revealed your secret to me. Have you not been tempted to use your skills on me?]]></string>
<string id="526619"><![CDATA[But why would he give you so difficult a task, my child? He is well aware that the Kains, blinded by fury, are looking for the mysterious maneater who supposedly murdered Simon... In their anger, they are missing the obvious—but such is that family's way... Even our protection may be of no use!]]></string>
<string id="526620"><![CDATA[The truth will speak for itself. They won't dare hurt me... I suppose.]]></string>
<string id="526621"><![CDATA[Perhaps. But Georgiy will never speak to you, will he? Or do you wield such power over people as to be able to make him talk?]]></string>
<string id="526622"><![CDATA[No, I have no such power. But cunning will become the solution where power can't. If you help me, I can make him answer questions.]]></string>
<string id="526623"><![CDATA[I'm under protection of a power that will make any ruler's army beat a retreat.]]></string>
<string id="526625"><![CDATA[Who are Mistresses?]]></string>
<string id="526626"><![CDATA[There was a time when the head of each of the three families brought into his house a woman of supernatural powers. The first one was Victor Kain, Simon and Georgiy's brother. He had lived in the Capital when he was very young. Matters concerning the running of his estate had been the pretext for his leaving, but in truth, he was attracted by something entirely different...]]></string>
<string id="526627"><![CDATA[Namely?]]></string>
<string id="526628"><![CDATA[I'm not in a position to tell you at this point. Because of the connections he had made in those circles, he became acquainted with one Nina Lilich. A bright, refined, devilish artistocrat who fell for Victor for some reason, and he brought her here, in this faraway corner of the Steppe.]]></string>
<string id="526629"><![CDATA[And what happened then? ]]></string>
<string id="526630"><![CDATA[It turned out then that Nina was harbouring plans concerning this place... And the Kains' elders, Georgiy and Simon, had certainly impressed her... To put it briefly, Nina became the ruler of this land. I was only—what?—fifteen at the time... Yes, Nina died eleven years ago.]]></string>
<string id="526631"><![CDATA[Where did her power lie?]]></string>
<string id="526632"><![CDATA[It is impossible to describe. It is beyond the mind to grasp. She emanated a demonic passion. She inspired those around her and radiated the faith in the limitlessness of human capacities. Those who were near her were blinded by that faith... She was the source of many a horrific and brilliant idea. Then Victoria came along.]]></string>
<string id="526633"><![CDATA[Was she like that too?]]></string>
<string id="526634"><![CDATA[No, she was completely different. For Nina, human lives were tools, while Victoria protected them. I think that was why Big Vlad Olgimsky had brought her here. He had married her a long time ago... but she and their son, Vlad the Younger, who was very small at the time, used to live far away, somewhere in the eastern region...]]></string>
<string id="526635"><![CDATA[Is she dead too?]]></string>
<string id="526636"><![CDATA[She is. Mysteriously, they are both survived by daughters... Nina bore Maria, and Victoria had little Victoria who our children call Capella. Both girls were orphaned at an early age... and each grew up to manifest the abilities. There is a young Mistress growing up in each of the families.]]></string>
<string id="526637"><![CDATA[...So you have a daughter too? You're also... like that, aren't you?]]></string>
<string id="526638"><![CDATA[And what happened then? When did she come here?]]></string>
<string id="526639"><![CDATA[Each of the three families has been professing its own version of truth for many generations. Each family has embodied the power of a certain colour... and each is trying to refashion the world in its own likeness. It is good that the antagonism between the families prevents any single power from gaining the upper hand. We are building the town together, all of us, and we are building it through opposing each other.]]></string>
<string id="526642"><![CDATA[And what about the Mistresses? Nina and Victoria?]]></string>
<string id="526643"><![CDATA[Yes, their conflict had raged over the town for a long time—peaceful, invisible to the ordinary people, but no less furious for it. Nina was striving to get to a place where no human being is allowed, and dragging her followers along, believing that her goal justified their suffering. Victoria protected the people from her, sculpted the very flesh of the town—for as long as she was alive.]]></string>
<string id="526644"><![CDATA[The third one, the youngest Mistress in the town, and the only one as of now, is myself. The only Mistress without an heiress. Everything has its limits in this world. Everything is balanced... Woe is me. But you and I will discuss that later.]]></string>
<string id="526645"><![CDATA[Fine... As you wish.]]></string>
<string id="526647"><![CDATA[I have such abilities too. I'm not one to doubt the existence of supernatural powers.]]></string>
<string id="526648"><![CDATA[There was a prophecy of twin angels. It spoke of a harbinger of death, the imminent disaster incarnate, who is to come to the town—along with a holy healer who can perform miracles with her hands and deliver us from evil. Now I understand who is standing before me. Tell me, are you yourself aware of your calling?]]></string>
<string id="526649"><![CDATA[I am! I said so at once…]]></string>
<string id="526650"><![CDATA[I thought I was a mere modest servant of virtue…]]></string>

<string id="526653"><![CDATA[Now, go to Alexander. Be brave, no matter what he asks you. You have nothing to be afraid of, for I see that you are the true harbinger. Such things can neither be changed nor hidden from me. Time has proven that I do not make mistakes. Fear nothing and return triumphant.]]></string>

<string id="526719"><![CDATA[All right. But how am I to find it, now that it's hiding from me?]]></string>
<string id="526720"><![CDATA[I feel that the sun is setting on the Saburovs. There's too little time left, it's almost tomorrow... Our reign has been short. And the price for it will be us turning from one of the town's most powerful people into some of its most miserable. Do you really need patronage from such people?]]></string>

<string id="526730"><![CDATA[That's a lie. You know how good I am…]]></string>
<string id="526731"><![CDATA[I do, generally... But we don't know what to think anymore... You've just talked of such dreadful things…]]></string>

<string id="526739"><![CDATA[I can see you're in low spirits…]]></string>
<string id="526740"><![CDATA[I'm burdened by a heavy sin, my dear child. Just a day ago, I was waiting for you to come. I wanted to open my heart to you. If you were truly a saint, you'd be hearing my confession now. But it turns out you've tricked everyone... The holy healer has revealed her demonic grin...]]></string>
<string id="526741"><![CDATA[…Good grief! What's going on? Seems like I'm lagging behind the events...]]></string>
<string id="526742"><![CDATA[Who do you all think I am? I'm so tired of these lies…]]></string>
<string id="526743"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="526744"><![CDATA[We are alike, you and I... And today is the day that blades have crossed over our heads... Never has the end of your path and mine loomed so clearly before... Today those who've risen up against us can win…]]></string>
<string id="526745"><![CDATA[Yes, I'll agree. I'll surrender to him so that you could stay here with me—a wonderful being, a tiny part of myself…]]></string>
<string id="526746"><![CDATA[That is a holy deed, for there is self-sacrifice in it. Holiness and sacrifice are sisters, they are connected... just like you and I.]]></string>

<string id="526748"><![CDATA[Don't cry... He is crafty. He speaks the truth, just like everyone connected to the Earth, but he distorts it... Mistress Katerina's prophesies are like that too.]]></string>

<string id="526750"><![CDATA[It may be a good thing... Maybe you shouldn't have been with her... Was it your own decision to become her daughter? No... So what are you afraid of? If you want to remain loyal to her, stay; you'll get a chance to show your true devotion to her yet…]]></string>

<string id="526759"><![CDATA[Did the dead tell you that?]]></string>
<string id="526760"><![CDATA[I've come here on Alexander's orders. Same as you, I guess?]]></string>
<string id="526761"><![CDATA[Warehouse dwellers, by the looks of it; Grief's minions. They plundered the dead and finished off the wounded. They spared no-one! Although one dying man did manage to hide from them. In the fuss, no one noticed him crawl away towards the cemetery. He must have crossed the marsh... I suppose they're angry as hell!]]></string>
<string id="526762"><![CDATA[How do you know that?]]></string>
<string id="526763"><![CDATA[A bit of eavesdropping. I hid in the fuss too, and this is where I'm hiding from them now. They're out and about nearby; just gotten as far as the rocks. I'm waiting for them to go away so I can call for help and do what my lord told me to.]]></string>
<string id="526764"><![CDATA[And who's this with you?]]></string>
<string id="526765"><![CDATA[He's not with me! A wounded homeless boy. At first I thought he was another survivor—but he's apparently just wandered in... So I'm thinking, maybe he's one of the rogue lot?]]></string>
<string id="526766"><![CDATA[Is he seriously injured?]]></string>
<string id="526767"><![CDATA[Well, he's carved up a good bit! See how he's clutching his side? So who's been getting playful with a knife? Been a while since anybody got knifed around here... And the other one, the one that crawled away to the cemetery—there wasn't an unbloodied spot on him. This one here was pretty lucky. You could almost say unharmed.]]></string>
<string id="526768"><![CDATA[Yes. I am a faithful man, a servant of the Saburovs. There were two of us... We came to see about the dead and wounded, only to discover that robbers were already running rampant around here! They attacked us and... most likely killed my assistant.]]></string>
<string id="526769"><![CDATA[What sort of robbers were they?]]></string>
<string id="526770"><![CDATA[I didn't mean to! I wanted to heal him! I felt sorry for him…]]></string>
<string id="526771"><![CDATA[Then it must have been the supreme judgement. With you as the judge. Yes... it makes sense. Had he deserved to live, you'd have given him life—right? But the murderer deserved to die, so you dealt him death. Yes... It's much like what the Mistress foretold!]]></string>
<string id="526772"><![CDATA[Who? Katerina?]]></string>
<string id="526773"><![CDATA[Yes... She screamed in her sleep a few days ago... Afterwards, her maids were whispering among themselves saying the Mistress had been talking deliriously in her sleep about a harbinger of fate who'd come in the guise of a child... Could that be you?]]></string>
<string id="526774"><![CDATA[Yes. It's me.]]></string>
<string id="526775"><![CDATA[Don't touch me please, I'm as full of sin as they come... what if that's enough for your touch to kill me? My master would surely be interested, but you were meaning to heal... You had better find somebody else... That's what he sent you here for, right?]]></string>
<string id="526776"><![CDATA[Serves him right.]]></string>
<string id="526777"><![CDATA[I see you're well informed... I suppose you're religious, faithful man? Do you read mystical and spiritual books?]]></string>
<string id="526778"><![CDATA[I doubt it…]]></string>
<string id="526779"><![CDATA[Those people were wondering if he had crawled away eastwards into the Steppe. He must have been from the Steppe himself, a local, so he'd want to be buried in living earth. If he's still breathing and has made it there, then the cemetery caretaker's daughter must have given him shelter.]]></string>
<string id="526780"><![CDATA[Ah! I know her.]]></string>
<string id="526781"><![CDATA[I'll tell Alexander that you're conscientiously doing your duty.]]></string>
<string id="526782"><![CDATA[Thanks for the advice, faithful man.]]></string>
<string id="526785"><![CDATA[Well... I suppose I had done what was a mighty rotten thing to do, and mucked it up like an idiot, at that. So my former Soul-and-a-Half mates, they threw me out, called me a traitor and all that. Hunted me. But I'm a slick one. I saved myself. Thought I'd made it out. And what do you know, along comes Leathersack!]]></string>
<string id="526786"><![CDATA[Leathersack?]]></string>
<string id="526787"><![CDATA[Some Ripper I'd never seen round here before. And he's like, stop right there, imma question you. Are you wanted for such-and-such crimes, are you carrying valuables on your person, exetra exetra—and then whack he goes with that razor. But I wriggled myself free—saved myself again! And then wobbled my way to this place, and then...]]></string>
<string id="526788"><![CDATA[What did you do to cross the boys? Look me in the eye and speak honestly, or else forget about getting help from me.]]></string>
<string id="526789"><![CDATA[Uh... honestly, it was pretty bad. You see, there's those shmowder things. Y'know, powders-shmowders. We had an outbreak a couple of years ago—they called it the Sand Pest. It would burn up your blood. So these shmowders, they helped if you caught it. There are still some left, but they're hard to come by.]]></string>
<string id="526790"><![CDATA[This is just abominable! I'm not touching someone like you, ever!]]></string>
<string id="526791"><![CDATA[Oh yes, yes! I'm all remorse and penny tins! Just do something, stop the bleeding at least, tie it with a hanky, would you? See how the bastard has sliced me into ribbons with that razor of his? Ah, just let me get to him. I'll tie him up and give him twice the pain he gave me!]]></string>
<string id="526792"><![CDATA[Be quiet and hold still! I'm going to lay my hands on you, and you'll get better.]]></string>
<string id="526793"><![CDATA[...Good grief. Do you at least feel some remorse?]]></string>
<string id="526794"><![CDATA[I could heal you, but I won't. You're much too disgusting.]]></string>
<string id="526795"><![CDATA[And…?]]></string>
<string id="526796"><![CDATA[A-and now there was this rumour, about the Pest being back and even a couple of folks, what's the word, sick-coming to it; and one of our lot had a shmowder. Was saving it for his sister in case she caught the Pest. Basically, I, you know, stole it.]]></string>
<string id="526797"><![CDATA[What for? For yourself?]]></string>
<string id="526798"><![CDATA[Nah, not for myself. Our gang, the Soul-and-a-Halves, is at war with another gang, the Dogheads; quite a fight this is, last drop of blood and all. The Dogheads outnumber us, and they've set up their lair at the Tower. And the Tower is... a dream tower of pure gold, if you like. You wouldn't understand. So I thought I'd switch sides. With that shmowder as an admission fee.]]></string>
<string id="526799"><![CDATA[So you stole medicine from a friend, who might need it to save his sister's life, and you did it so you could be a more desirable sell-out? Right?]]></string>
<string id="526800"><![CDATA[What does it matter! Everyone steals; everyone sells out; it's in our nature. Whoever isn't a thieving man—is a thieving woman, ha ha! The real nasty part is that when my scheme was out, the fool rushed me and tried to take his shmowder back, so I... waited for the right moment and offed him.]]></string>
<string id="526801"><![CDATA[Ah, to hell with you!]]></string>
<string id="526802"><![CDATA[Take pity on me, please do, gentle girl... I may be a murderer, but I'm just a wee little murderer. I may end up reformed yet! After I've ripped nasty Ripper's throat out, that is.]]></string>
<string id="526803"><![CDATA[You don't seem like you could take pity to anyone.]]></string>
<string id="526804"><![CDATA[I feel that fate has brought me here for a reason. And made me meet such a wretch here for a reason, too.]]></string>

<string id="526813"><![CDATA[No one. I've come of my own accord.]]></string>
<string id="526814"><![CDATA[Alexander Saburov, the ruler. It was him who tasked me with healing the wounded man!]]></string>
<string id="526815"><![CDATA[Then what the hell are you doing here?]]></string>
<string id="526816"><![CDATA[I'm looking for the wounded man...]]></string>
<string id="526817"><![CDATA[And why didn't you follow him yourself?]]></string>
<string id="526818"><![CDATA[It's better for me stay out of the town. Every passer-by rushes to tackle me and tie me up. I wonder what I did to deserve this Ripper fame.]]></string>
<string id="526819"><![CDATA[It was certainly none of my doing!]]></string>
<string id="526820"><![CDATA[Don't stand in my way, Changeling! I don't care if you're a thief or not. But I don't want our paths to cross. Do you understand?]]></string>
<string id="526823"><![CDATA[No, but he will be soon. He's lost so much blood that only a miracle could revive him.]]></string>
<string id="526824"><![CDATA[I can work miracles.]]></string>
<string id="526825"><![CDATA[Curious. And how do you go about doing that?]]></string>
<string id="526826"><![CDATA[I lay my hands on someone in pain, and they are brought back to life.]]></string>
<string id="526827"><![CDATA[…So not only are half the people here psychics. Turns out the other half are faith healers! What kind of a town is this? What kind of a time? I've been transported to the Middle Ages! I presume you can demonstrate your art right here in front of me?]]></string>
<string id="526828"><![CDATA[I can. Watch.]]></string>

<string id="526832"><![CDATA[I myself sometimes find it hard to believe what I'm capable of.]]></string>
<string id="526833"><![CDATA[Now I don't feel like it anymore. You're an evil man.]]></string>
<string id="526834"><![CDATA[...So who is this killer? How do I find them? This is getting plain right diabolical!]]></string>
<string id="526835"><![CDATA[I'll tell you if I find something out.]]></string>
<string id="526836"><![CDATA[It definitely wasn't me. You have to believe me.]]></string>
<string id="526838"><![CDATA[Why interrogate me?]]></string>
<string id="526839"><![CDATA[Well, because I'm inclined to believe it was you who killed Simon.]]></string>
<string id="526840"><![CDATA[…You're mad! Why?]]></string>
<string id="526841"><![CDATA[Superstitious people claim that Simon was killed by a demon. A creature they call the shabnak-adyg... which has the outward appearance of, if I recall correctly, a girl covered in earth's dirt. Now I despise superstition, but behind a tall tale there's often a truth that lends itself to rational explanation.]]></string>
<string id="526842"><![CDATA[I'm not a demon! Quite the opposite! I can prove it.]]></string>
<string id="526843"><![CDATA[Really? Prove it how?]]></string>
<string id="526844"><![CDATA[This man's already dead, I hope…?]]></string>
<string id="526845"><![CDATA[In a manner of speaking. To a degree. A degree that I feel used to be a good deal higher! God, why is the world filled with predators—wherever you run, from coast to coast! No place is safe from them! They murder, they rape, they tear apart, they threaten, they destroy...]]></string>
<string id="526846"><![CDATA[There are good people too…]]></string>
<string id="526847"><![CDATA[Are there? Look over, there's kind people for you. The Bachelor, giving orders like he's entitled to me... What could I tell him? All I can do is stay silent, swallowing my tears... And do you know why this is so, my girl? Listen... The Law is not on our side!]]></string>
<string id="526848"><![CDATA[The Law?]]></string>
<string id="526849"><![CDATA[Shh! Yes... You and I are outlaws. The Law is a grindstone, heavy as a bell, inexorable and persistent. You need a certain amount of power to stand up to it... But where do you get it? And so many of us here don't really have a choice; we are doomed to be victims.]]></string>
<string id="526850"><![CDATA[Why are you counting me among them?]]></string>
<string id="526851"><![CDATA[You know, I recognized you at once, I did... Aren't you being persecuted? Aren't you being called a thief? Haven't you had the words "shabnak", "turnskin", "maneater" thrown in your face? Haven't they looked for bones under your skin, or dropped swevery juice into your eyes?]]></string>
<string id="526852"><![CDATA[No, they haven't! Nothing of the sort…]]></string>
<string id="526853"><![CDATA[Pst! Quiet! He's listening!]]></string>

<string id="526855"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="526856"><![CDATA[I don't know. It's not I who heal, it's the power that chose me as its instrument.]]></string>
<string id="526857"><![CDATA[I will be your friend, girl... What else can you do?]]></string>
<string id="526858"><![CDATA[Isn't that enough for you? Anyway, you'll have a chance to see more... I'll be visiting you often.]]></string>
<string id="526859"><![CDATA[A lot of... unusual things. People believe that I'm a miracle-worker.]]></string>
<string id="526860"><![CDATA[Are you that scared of him?]]></string>
<string id="526861"><![CDATA[My goodness... Everything points to this Ripper being a heinous murderer! He's unstoppable. He could wrestle down Andrey Stamatin with just one arm. Ah, forget Andrey; the ghastliest thing is that he apparently killed a homeless boy in the Steppe today.]]></string>
<string id="526862"><![CDATA[…Do you want me to ask him personally?]]></string>
<string id="526863"><![CDATA[There's no need to. There are more discreet ways to do it. I've heard he made friends with Warehouse dwellers... There are two gangs over at the Warehouses, Bad Grief's smugglers and the adolescent urchins. You can ask them; that homeless boy was a criminal as well.]]></string>
<string id="526865"><![CDATA[Yikes! I can't take on so formidable an enemy, don't even think about it…]]></string>
<string id="526868"><![CDATA[Now explain to me why you're so afraid of circus performers.]]></string>
<string id="526869"><![CDATA[How come…? Although—you are a kind girl, aren't you?—I suppose every cloud has a silver lining... You know, I'll tell you one of my secrets. But be hush-hush about it! Children… are the root of all evil in this world!]]></string>
<string id="526870"><![CDATA[And so?]]></string>
<string id="526871"><![CDATA[Yes, that homeless boy was attacked by the Haruspex, and he's dead now.]]></string>
<string id="526872"><![CDATA[I realized what sort of an adolescent he was. He died at my hands. Because he was a rascal.]]></string>
<string id="526880"><![CDATA[Ugh! He's been here all right. A right scary husky fellow, that one... No idea what got into his head to come over. I sure hope I've seen the last of him.]]></string>
<string id="526881"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="526882"><![CDATA[Welp, it's a nasty story... That scoundrel, Lika, has commited a lowly vility! Sold us out to just about everyone out there—the thieves, the Dogheads too... then poisoned a friend he'd robbed, and ran away. I was angry, so I said the rascal deserves be killed. Angry as hell... And along comes this bloody Haruspex! Out of nowhere...]]></string>
<string id="526883"><![CDATA[So he's fond of running murderous errands?]]></string>
<string id="526885"><![CDATA[He didn't need it himself?]]></string>
<string id="526886"><![CDATA[He? He doesn't; he'd shoot anyone dead with his bare hands.]]></string>
<string id="526887"><![CDATA[Notkin, my dear, give it to me. I'll dispose of it my way…]]></string>
<string id="526888"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm not greedy—and this one, by the way, is a lady's gun; it'll fit into your hand just right. Besides, it doesn't shoot... I guess.]]></string>
<string id="526889"><![CDATA[Thank you, kind boy…]]></string>
<string id="526890"><![CDATA[Would you say he's a criminal?]]></string>
<string id="526891"><![CDATA[If anyone's a criminal here, it's me... No doubt about that now. Or is it you somehow making me soppy? Oh man, what have I done...]]></string>

<string id="526894"><![CDATA[He wants to know how... dangerous my supernatural abilities are.]]></string>
<string id="526895"><![CDATA[…I suppose I was too quick to laugh at you... Let me see... You seem as though you were two people... You are a walking lie... But you shouldn't be killed yet.

<string id="526896"><![CDATA[Your uncle... Georgiy has sent me to you... so that you could take a look at me and say what you think about me.]]></string>
<string id="526897"><![CDATA[Why should I?]]></string>
<string id="526898"><![CDATA[Your abilities? Ha ha ha... Fine sort of a Mistress! Well, let me look at you then, let me listen to you carefully... What is he getting so nervous about?]]></string>
<string id="526899"><![CDATA[…I don't know. He demanded that I be examined by you.]]></string>
<string id="526900"><![CDATA[Ha ha ha ha... How touching... Since when has this place become a hospital reception room? An elderly doctor's sending a patient for examination. Shall I write you a prescription?]]></string>
<string id="526901"><![CDATA[You don't seem particularly upset by your uncle's death.]]></string>
<string id="526902"><![CDATA[I guess there's no need. Just say the words, I'll let him know.]]></string>
<string id="526903"><![CDATA[Georgiy advised me to seek your counsel, Maria, on whether I'm worthy of asking him questions.]]></string>
<string id="526904"><![CDATA[I have no idea. I'm just trying to do as the proverbial Romans do.]]></string>
<string id="526905"><![CDATA[This is a Rome that one doesn't come uninvited to in the first place. What did Georgiy ask you about?]]></string>
<string id="526906"><![CDATA[You can see for yourself that my mystical abilities are negligible.]]></string>
<string id="526907"><![CDATA[He said you should have a look at me.]]></string>
<string id="526908"><![CDATA[You're a cheerful girl, aren't you, Maria. Let's have a good laugh together. Ha ha ha... ha?]]></string>
<string id="526909"><![CDATA[What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="526910"><![CDATA[You laid your hands on a mortally wounded man and brought him back to life, calling on the holy powers to bear witness. Your demeanour was, so they say, like that of a miracle-worker or even a saint of sorts. Is this so?]]></string>

<string id="526912"><![CDATA[Is that so? Very well, I will lend you my ear, but no sooner than you have met Maria, my niece. Let her look at you with her own eyes and tell me who you are and how I should treat anything you tell me.]]></string>

<string id="527054"><![CDATA[Bad Grief is the kingpin of the criminal world. He has a lair in the northern Warehouses, where he trades in weapons, twyrine, and other nastiness. Every murderer and criminal has a connection to him one way or another; that's the way it goes here. And that's why I'm asking you again: were you on your way to him or not?]]></string>
<string id="527055"><![CDATA[Do I look like a criminal to you!?]]></string>
<string id="527056"><![CDATA[Hm... Some people came running through the Warehouses a few minutes ago. They told everyone that a horrible killer—the whole town's apparently already out to get him—had tried to escape by train, got ambushed, killed everyone, and was now going back here. And so now I'm thinking: were they perhaps talking about you?]]></string>
<string id="527057"><![CDATA[It's a misunderstanding. I came from far away and got attacked.]]></string>
<string id="527058"><![CDATA[Lika. The name fits; the prick's a natural-born boot-licker. I can't even figure out who he's sold out to, the thieves or the Dogheads. He's stolen the most precious thing from us, from his mates! The bastard! And on top of that, he's done it right when a war's about to start!]]></string>
<string id="527060"><![CDATA[It was self-defence. They mistook me for someone else.]]></string>
<string id="527061"><![CDATA[Okay then. You do look like you've been through a lot... We'd like to help you, but we've been robbed too. And, as bad luck would have it, it's the medicine that's been snatched! Lika, that bastard! He's a traitor, a thief, a thug, and a prick!]]></string>

<string id="527066"><![CDATA[I think I'll go speak to this Grief of yours.]]></string>
<string id="527067"><![CDATA[Hey... That's nothin', nothin' at all! So I took somethin'. It's common property, right? So it's mine, too. They'd have slangwhanged over the shmowder anyway, he heh. Ya could say I did them a favour! And so I hurt the doggy, true, but in self-defence, nothin' more! One's right to defend himself is sacred, right?]]></string>

<string id="527082"><![CDATA[All right. I'll speak to this bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="527083"><![CDATA[Just wait till the evening, please. Right now he is also confused... so he'll shoot first and ask questions later. And just... please do your best not to break more bones. Do not attack random people in the street. Just go easy on them and work on gradually restoring your good name...

<string id="527084"><![CDATA[Is that so?]]></string>
<string id="527085"><![CDATA[It is. All of them have been seeing Isidor quite often lately. Maybe some of them can even surmise who the real killer is.

<string id="527090"><![CDATA[Whoa… So that's with whom I have the honour. My apologies, sir. I had no idea. Thought you were a random tramp. So you already know he's been murdered, right?]]></string>
<string id="527091"><![CDATA[I do. Do you know how?]]></string>
<string id="527092"><![CDATA[The lads told me he'd returned from the Steppe, so I went to visit him. He'd spent many days in the Steppe this time, you know. I thought he might tell me something about the Bulls. So there I went, but all I saw was smoke, and the stench was as if someone was burning a blanket. The lights were on, but he wasn't there. He went to Simon. Came back almost at dawn and chased me off.]]></string>
<string id="527093"><![CDATA[Chased you off?]]></string>
<string id="527094"><![CDATA[Well... People are saying a demon of the Steppe killed him. A shabnak. A maneater made of bones, you know? The thing is, her claw was stuck in his chest when they found him. Well, not necessarily hers… but it was a monster's claw. Or a fang… A bone, anyway.]]></string>
<string id="527095"><![CDATA[What? What monster?]]></string>
<string id="527096"><![CDATA[A huge one. Claw the size of a man's elbow. A crooked bone, snapped at its base. The rumour flew right away that a maneater from the scary stories, the shabnak-adyr, had come out of the Steppe to punish us.]]></string>
<string id="527097"><![CDATA[When was the last time you saw him?]]></string>
<string id="527098"><![CDATA[Stomping his feet even! "Don't you even come close to me," he said. It was weird, he'd always been a kind old man... I thought maybe I'd done something wrong. And right afterwards this Lika bastard caused all that mess, so I had to go back. I only heard about the claw in the morning. Haven't seen it myself.]]></string>
<string id="527099"><![CDATA[…Are my nails really that long?]]></string>
<string id="527100"><![CDATA[Yeah, I've heard... you've been falsely accused. People have been told to go catch Simon's murderer at the Station. That was before the claw, Isidor hadn't been found yet. Then they declared there was one murderer; Simon had been killed by a shabnak. Fine tangle, this whole business...]]></string>
<string id="527101"><![CDATA[Thank you, Notkin.]]></string>
<string id="527102"><![CDATA[Grace, did you see my father, Isidor Burakh, yesterday?]]></string>

<string id="527104"><![CDATA[Have you talked to him?]]></string>
<string id="527105"><![CDATA[No, but I followed him. He entered his house, and then I felt that he was anxious… desperate even. He smelled of smoke. I didn't dare knock on the door, but peeked through the window.]]></string>
<string id="527106"><![CDATA[What did you see?]]></string>
<string id="527107"><![CDATA[I saw him take off his warm clothes, take them outside, and burn them. Then he wiped his body with cloth, threw it on the floor and burnt it as well. Then he got dressed and left. I followed him. I tried to call out for him quietly, but he didn't hear me. He arrived at the Stone Yard and knocked on Simon's door. They let him in.]]></string>
<string id="527108"><![CDATA[And then?]]></string>

<string id="527124"><![CDATA[I saw him return home. He sat down and was just sitting for the longest time. Didn't move. Fell asleep most likely. Then I came back here. Saw you arrive.]]></string>
<string id="527125"><![CDATA[What? You saw me get off the train?]]></string>
<string id="527126"><![CDATA[I saw you get into a fight too. Then I hid myself and fell asleep.]]></string>
<string id="527127"><![CDATA[So you came back from my father, and then I arrived… Has a lot of time passed between these two events?]]></string>
<string id="527128"><![CDATA[Yes. I had enough time to repair the mousetrap.]]></string>
<string id="527129"><![CDATA[Will you tell what you've just told me to anyone else if I bring them here?]]></string>

<string id="527135"><![CDATA[My name is Murky. Your nose is tilted.]]></string>
<string id="527137"><![CDATA[Well... that can be helped.]]></string>
<string id="527138"><![CDATA[I'll make do.]]></string>
<string id="527139"><![CDATA[I need to be alone for a while.]]></string>
<string id="527140"><![CDATA[If the Bachelor finds you before you find him... the consequences... need I say more? But first you need to find convincing arguments in your favor… so that you two have something to talk about when you finally meet. Me vouching for you won't be enough...]]></string>
<string id="527141"><![CDATA[But how can that be done?]]></string>
<string id="527142"><![CDATA[I don't know yet... I wonder what my daughter has to say about it. She's inherited a lot from her mother, you know. She can feel the things that we cannot even imagine. Subordination is essential, true, but the girl is undoubtedly smarter than me.]]></string>
<string id="527143"><![CDATA[Did my father know beforehand he would die… for the same reason?]]></string>

<string id="527163"><![CDATA[…No. I want to know what power it wields.]]></string>
<string id="527164"><![CDATA[And now answer my final question. Will any of the Kains benefit from this death?]]></string>
<string id="527165"><![CDATA[…No. None of us would be able to advance and sustain the town in the way Simon did. And if his death was not a tragic accident but the ruling of some remorseless law, it will mean that our family's entire cause has been condemned. The town will perish.]]></string>
<string id="527166"><![CDATA[Could one of the townsfolk be the murderer?]]></string>

<string id="527169"><![CDATA[What are you going to do now?]]></string>

<string id="527180"><![CDATA[I must say, though, that I don't have the slightest idea where he's to be found now. I suppose his new ally is better informed of his plans.]]></string>

<string id="527187"><![CDATA[What business?]]></string>
<string id="527188"><![CDATA[It'll all be fine.]]></string>
<string id="527189"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="527190"><![CDATA[Why are you here?]]></string>
<string id="527191"><![CDATA[I need to see the Bachelor. Is he with you?]]></string>
<string id="527192"><![CDATA[The mutineers have captured some architect, one Andrey Stamatin. Your Bachelor took the news to heart and decided to get him out.]]></string>
<string id="527193"><![CDATA[It will be too late! They'll have shot the Bachelor!]]></string>
<string id="527194"><![CDATA[I have no other choice. I'm in charge of maintaining order, and I have my own orders to follow. Moreover, my intuition is telling me that Bachelor Dankovsky will make it out of there alive. He's not the type to let himself get shot in the head easily.]]></string>
<string id="527195"><![CDATA[How can you say something like that?]]></string>
<string id="527196"><![CDATA[It's very important.]]></string>
<string id="527197"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="527198"><![CDATA[How did you get here?]]></string>
<string id="527199"><![CDATA[I've got bad news from the Inquisitor. You've been stripped of your mandate. I think she's decided to get rid of you.]]></string>

<string id="527206"><![CDATA[Are you the harbinger of my death? Well, that won't make me change my plans. I'm going to the Abattoir. Foreman Oyun is awaiting me for the final trial. I don't expect to survive it anyway. But you have promised to help, haven't you?]]></string>
<string id="527207"><![CDATA[Who, me?]]></string>
<string id="527208"><![CDATA[One of us is an idiot, right?]]></string>
<string id="527209"><![CDATA[No! I don't want anybody to die! And I need Oyun alive, too. I'm going to see him.]]></string>

<string id="527211"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="527212"><![CDATA[Speak, Mistress.]]></string>
<string id="527213"><![CDATA[So you're prepared to give your life? Why?]]></string>
<string id="527214"><![CDATA[Was he really ready to jump into the hole? That is good. His resolve is honourable and proves him worthy of inheriting the title of Foreman of the Abattoir.]]></string>
<string id="527215"><![CDATA[What would have happened if he'd descended into the abyss?]]></string>
<string id="527216"><![CDATA[He would have died. I wanted to take his life by cunning, in order to stay head of the Kin. Now that I have you, transformer of blood, I see a better use for myself. Go. Your Haruspex is awaiting the verdict of his fate in the cave at the Gorge.]]></string>
<string id="527217"><![CDATA[I'm going.]]></string>
<string id="527218"><![CDATA[I am no Mistress. My time hasn't come yet.]]></string>

<string id="527220"><![CDATA[What are you doing here, spirit?]]></string>
<string id="527221"><![CDATA[I've talked to the Foreman. You need to hear this: he's resigning and will soon hand his powers over to you.]]></string>
<string id="527222"><![CDATA[I know how to make a panacea out of blood and herbs. The trouble is that the right blood is very rarely found in nature. You shouldn't hate this town. It's beautiful. It hasn't lost its bond with the Earth. It combines incompatible things. Different eras linger in it alongside each other. There are no towns like this anymore... and there'll hardly ever be again...]]></string>
<string id="527223"><![CDATA[Take heart. I'll give you blood that is like the blood you seek.]]></string>
<string id="527224"><![CDATA[I'm not a spirit. I'm human.]]></string>
<string id="527225"><![CDATA[Inquisitor Aglaya Lilich! I have a better solution than the one suggested by the Haruspex and the Bachelor. Now I know it for certain. It all fits.]]></string>
<string id="527226"><![CDATA[Well now, say what you have to say, instrument of the Law.]]></string>
<string id="527227"><![CDATA[There's a way to preserve the town! It's hard to believe, but I'm certain of it. The disease will continue to exist too—but it will become completely harmless! It will be tamed, just like smallpox. I'll do this with my hands. I'm going to stay here. We can inoculate people. And people will survive.]]></string>
<string id="527228"><![CDATA[Are you really imagining yourself a miracle-worker?]]></string>
<string id="527229"><![CDATA[So that's why I'm a thief?]]></string>
<string id="527230"><![CDATA[That's why you're a thief. You're guilty of the theft of your own fate. You were never to try on this halo. It's as absurd as a hangman playing the miraculous rescuer while the execution is already ongoing.]]></string>
<string id="527231"><![CDATA[Now I understand everything…]]></string>
<string id="527232"><![CDATA[I'm giving you an hour to leave the town, you little scum. I'm banishing the plague from this place, thereby accomplishing my mission. Out! And don't you dare look for a protector; no one's going to help you now.]]></string>
<string id="527233"><![CDATA[We'll see…]]></string>
<string id="527234"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor has ordered me to leave the town before the end of today.]]></string>
<string id="527235"><![CDATA[Indeed? This once again confirms that I was right about you. This is how a divine messenger would behave. I am your protector. Tell me what you want.]]></string>
<string id="527236"><![CDATA[I know of a number of people who have already resigned to their impending death. They even believe they deserve it. All I need is to find several volunteers among the Bound.]]></string>
<string id="527237"><![CDATA[Go and look for the ones you need then. I'll order my soldiers to defend you, should anyone dare make an attempt at your life. It's a shame that so few have remained loyal—and there'll be even less after we crush the revolt completely. But we will persevere! Afterwards, come back to me and tell me if you've been successful.]]></string>
<string id="527238"><![CDATA[Why should I come back?]]></string>
<string id="527239"><![CDATA[Wait. You're speaking too fast. I have different concerns at the moment. Actually it's good that you're here. Can you run one final errand for me—and then tell me about your decision? The business I have at hand is urgent.]]></string>
<string id="527240"><![CDATA[What is this?]]></string>
<string id="527241"><![CDATA[Give this package to kind Bachelor Dankovsky. It says inside that he's been stripped of all authority and is accused of high treason. Should he open it in front of you and ask you what he is to do, advise him to shoot himself.]]></string>
<string id="527242"><![CDATA[Why so? I thought you were friends…]]></string>
<string id="527243"><![CDATA[What? Friends? No, of course not! The Bachelor has become no less formidable of an enemy of the town than Lady Sand Pest.]]></string>
<string id="527244"><![CDATA[But why?]]></string>
<string id="527245"><![CDATA[You see, this town is a coherent structure or, if you like, a living organism. It's both, depending on the observer. It's like a sequence of interconnected organs or, more exactly still, a clockwork mechanism. But as soon as a foreign object is introduced, everything begins to crumble...]]></string>
<string id="527246"><![CDATA[I'm telling you, I know a way to avoid destroying anything that's been constructed here!]]></string>
<string id="527247"><![CDATA[Because there's a more important objective now. It's time to get rid of the Bachelor. He's gone too far.]]></string>
<string id="527248"><![CDATA[What?]]></string>
<string id="527249"><![CDATA[Whatever; just give the package to the Bachelor. We'll talk when you come back.]]></string>
<string id="527250"><![CDATA[But what does the Bachelor have to do with it?]]></string>
<string id="527251"><![CDATA[Bachelor Dankovsky has had the audacity to question this obvious truth. Apparently, he intends to destroy the human settlement—that is, the town proper, an administrative and social constituent unit of our country—for the sake of a chimaeric abomination! I'm going to stop him.]]></string>
<string id="527252"><![CDATA[There won't have to be any sacrifices, Inquisitor. Take my word for it.]]></string>
<string id="527253"><![CDATA[All right. Give me the package.]]></string>
<string id="527254"><![CDATA[What if there's poison in there or something like that? No, I'm not going…]]></string>
<string id="527255"><![CDATA[I think I know a way out... But I'm going to need your participation.]]></string>
<string id="527256"><![CDATA[Who but the iron-toothed General Ashes! The two destroyers now sing in unison. Getting half a million people killed is like putting a squiggle on paper to them.]]></string>
<string id="527257"><![CDATA[I'll find the Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="527258"><![CDATA[Give me the package.]]></string>
<string id="527259"><![CDATA[I must say, though, that I don't have the slightest idea where he's to be found now. I suppose his new ally is better informed of his plans.]]></string>
<string id="527260"><![CDATA[What new ally?]]></string>
<string id="527261"><![CDATA[Who but the iron-toothed General Ashes! The two destroyers now sing in unison. Getting half a million people killed is like putting a squiggle on paper to them.]]></string>
<string id="527262"><![CDATA[Don't worry. I'll find the Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="527264"><![CDATA[He's the one who needs to worry. Not me.]]></string>
<string id="527265"><![CDATA[…]]></string>
<string id="527266"><![CDATA[I don't understand yet.]]></string>
<string id="527267"><![CDATA[Doctor Rubin has conducted a scientific study. He has ascertained that the plague hasn't killed Simon Kain after all. Simon's blood contained corpuscles that had made the disease harmless. When I heal someone with my hands, their blood becomes like that too.]]></string>
<string id="527268"><![CDATA[So you're going to cure everyone as they get infected? I wonder how you'll manage it with a population of many thousand at this rate of contagion! Or the entire country's population if the disease escapes from the town.]]></string>
<string id="527269"><![CDATA[No, no... Of course I won't be enough. All the more because the blood needs to be predisposed... But there are people with this kind of blood who've agreed to... spend themselves entirely on vaccines for everyone else. I'll show them to you tomorrow!]]></string>
<string id="527270"><![CDATA[So you're saying you'll be able to maintain this fateful, this unnatural blend and even create a possibility for—oh my God—its further development through periodic transformation of some townspeople's blood, with a subsequent slaughtering of these people after the manner of what was done to Simon?]]></string>
<string id="527271"><![CDATA[Yes. That's correct.]]></string>
<string id="527273"><![CDATA[I can perform a miracle. No one else can, which is why no one else has thought of the same plan. Everyone believes miracles to be impossible.]]></string>
<string id="527274"><![CDATA[Another one... Nina was enough! She, too, used to sing about miracles, and ended up turning the town into a pagan altar. You'd like to set up a bloody conveyor line in which you will hold the key position, right? I won't let that happen!]]></string>
<string id="527277"><![CDATA[But why destroy when everything can be preserved?]]></string>
<string id="527278"><![CDATA[It's the Powers That Be who want to preserve everything; that's the reason there's an epidemic. Who do you think you are? You're no miracle-worker. You are an avatar of the Sand Plague. Do you understand? But instead of acting as an honest instrument of the Law, you have stolen the fate of another.]]></string>
<string id="527279"><![CDATA[Oh no... Anything but that…]]></string>
<string id="527280"><![CDATA[But…]]></string>
<string id="527281"><![CDATA[Enough! No more of this talk! Why are you so blind? Another obsessed idiot dragging thousands of victims into the very same trap! No, no... enough! Help me destroy the Polyhedron or leave the town at once—or else I'll have you executed!]]></string>
<string id="527282"><![CDATA[Awesome!]]></string>
<string id="527283"><![CDATA[I didn't quite understand... But it looks like it.]]></string>
<string id="527284"><![CDATA[They were going to execute someone by firing squad, but the squad turned out to be the mutineers. He's still not back yet. Will you go to the headquarters?]]></string>
<string id="527285"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="527286"><![CDATA[I haven't decided yet.]]></string>
<string id="527287"><![CDATA[Find out about him, please! I think it's Andrey who they were going to execute. He'd killed several soldiers yesterday when they were arresting Peter. I fear it won't end well.]]></string>
<string id="527288"><![CDATA[All right, just don't you cry.]]></string>
<string id="527289"><![CDATA[He shouldn't have walked into the firing line.]]></string>
<string id="527290"><![CDATA[No. He's not here. And I wouldn't advise you to follow him where he's gone.]]></string>
<string id="527291"><![CDATA[And where is that?]]></string>
<string id="527292"><![CDATA[And what about you?]]></string>
<string id="527293"><![CDATA[I'm gathering those who've stayed true to their oath. As soon as I restore order among my troops, we'll launch an operation to retake the cannon. I'll personally lead the loyal units.]]></string>
<string id="527294"><![CDATA[And... where is all that happening? The mutiny?]]></string>
<string id="527295"><![CDATA[They've seized a cannon and are holding position next to it. All of the mutineers are there now, except the ones who are busy looting. But don't you dare go there; they'll sort it out without you.]]></string>
<string id="527296"><![CDATA[So there's been a revolt within the ranks?]]></string>
<string id="527297"><![CDATA[Are there many of these mutineers?]]></string>
<string id="527298"><![CDATA[No. I'm going. My faith protects me.]]></string>
<string id="527299"><![CDATA[Why on earth did she do that?]]></string>
<string id="527300"><![CDATA[I've come up with a way to keep this town intact. All three of its parts, all three towns: the town of beasts, the town of men, and the town of children... But she said that as long as she's alive, that won't happen.]]></string>
<string id="527301"><![CDATA[And no surprise. So you've defied her plans?]]></string>
<string id="527302"><![CDATA[I think I have... She's bent on destroying the Polyhedron.]]></string>
<string id="527303"><![CDATA[Yes... And the Bachelor was going to rescue this architect precisely in order to find out whether the tower's brittle groundwork could withstand the bombardment if we had to level the residential areas…]]></string>
<string id="527304"><![CDATA[I know a way to preserve the town! But I need more time... a day at the very least.]]></string>
<string id="527305"><![CDATA[How many do you need?]]></string>
<string id="527306"><![CDATA[Seven, at least.]]></string>
<string id="527307"><![CDATA[I could put not seven, but seventy-seven men at your disposal.]]></string>
<string id="527308"><![CDATA[No... for one thing, they have to be Bound. Not all people are the same. These ones... have a rare blood type.]]></string>
<string id="527309"><![CDATA[All of these people will have to die. Furthermore, their free consent to it will be required.]]></string>
<string id="527310"><![CDATA[I've found the seven people!]]></string>
<string id="527311"><![CDATA[That quickly?]]></string>
<string id="527312"><![CDATA[I don't think that was quick.]]></string>
<string id="527313"><![CDATA[I must know with what arguments I am to defend your decision before the Inquisitor tomorrow. Force alone is not enough. All the more so because I don't have a lot of it left at my disposal... and will have even less by tomorrow evening.]]></string>
<string id="527314"><![CDATA[All right. I will be back!]]></string>
<string id="527315"><![CDATA[You've just been here and said there were sinners in this town, nine in total, who could sacrifice themselves for the cause of obtaining transformed blood. Sadly, you said, some of them were already incurably ill... You even hinted that their disease had been a consequence of your visit.]]></string>
<string id="527316"><![CDATA[What?]]></string>
<string id="527317"><![CDATA[You named names: Rubin, Foreman Oyun, the Saburovs—I've heard about those—then... Anna, Yulia, Aspity, Lara, and Grief. You said some of them were ill now.]]></string>
<string id="527318"><![CDATA[But it wasn't me!]]></string>
<string id="527319"><![CDATA[My eyes weren't lying to me. It was you. You described the way you could transform their blood so that it could be used to create a vaccine for the entire population. You... left and came back a quarter of a minute later.]]></string>
<string id="527320"><![CDATA[No... It was her again! My abhorrent doppelganger. It was she who infected my Bound!]]></string>
<string id="527321"><![CDATA[Tomorrow, you'll have time to bring them back to life.]]></string>

<string id="527325"><![CDATA[Do you want to die a thief, a murderer, a profiteer, and a smuggler?]]></string>

<string id="527327"><![CDATA[No, Mistress... I don't.]]></string>
<string id="527328"><![CDATA[Yes, Mistress. That's exactly how I'd like to die... like I ever could.]]></string>

<string id="527331"><![CDATA[Simon? Simon was a demigod. His blood... I've heard from Stakh about his blood. His was no blood of a human. There's blue blood, and then there's... silver blood, eh? 'N that's what his was.]]></string>
<string id="527332"><![CDATA[I'll lay my hands on you, and your veins will be filled with golden and silver and blue blood. Cut yourself and you'll see.]]></string>

<string id="527340"><![CDATA[I have chosen already. What right to you have to speak in this way to me, who was placed here by the loins of Suok, Mother of Clay, and the founder himself, Bos Turokh?]]></string>

<string id="527343"><![CDATA[I shall lay my hands on you and give you a chance to die like Simon Kain died—if you agree, like he did, to give your blood to those in thirst.]]></string>
<string id="527344"><![CDATA[Will you transform me into Bos Primigenius? Do you possess the power to turn a human into an aurochs?]]></string>
<string id="527345"><![CDATA[Yes. And you'll be convinced of it.]]></string>
<string id="527346"><![CDATA[I am convinced already. Promises are unneeded. I want to undo my shame and die like a Warden.]]></string>
<string id="527347"><![CDATA[So you agree?]]></string>
<string id="527348"><![CDATA[Yes. I agree.]]></string>
<string id="527349"><![CDATA[Will you agree to testify before the General?]]></string>
<string id="527350"><![CDATA[I will if you deem it necessary.]]></string>
<string id="527351"><![CDATA[May Suok imbue you with her vital humours.]]></string>

<string id="527357"><![CDATA[Yes. I'm quick!]]></string>
<string id="527358"><![CDATA[I see... Which of them exactly?]]></string>
<string id="527359"><![CDATA[Everything is lost now, isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="527360"><![CDATA[You don't want to destroy the town, do you?]]></string>
<string id="527361"><![CDATA[No. I don't. I'm prepared to sacrifice my career in order to avoid razing and killing this town.]]></string>
<string id="527362"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="527363"><![CDATA[I was born and raised in a town like this one. Firing at it is torture for me. But that isn't the main reason...]]></string>
<string id="527364"><![CDATA[I'm surprised to hear you talk like that…]]></string>
<string id="527365"><![CDATA[Everything in this town is precious. This place is symbolic. That which is below has left our world for good—having turned into lifeless bones, into museum pieces. That which is above will never come around again. It's a potential future that I don't want to lose.]]></string>
<string id="527366"><![CDATA[How do you know?]]></string>
<string id="527367"><![CDATA[The Haruspex has demonstrated the former to me, and the Bachelor, the latter. Written into this town is the destiny of our entire country. And I feel that the Creator is watching me now, as I'm making my choice. The part I am to play in the fate of this town will have an effect on the part I am to play in the fate of our country.]]></string>
<string id="527368"><![CDATA[I have felt the same.]]></string>
<string id="527369"><![CDATA[Everything will be all right.]]></string>
<string id="527370"><![CDATA[If you transform my blood with your hands, I'll part without regret with the life that I have lived and tainted. Let the good that comes out of my death give a meaning to my wasted life.]]></string>
<string id="527371"><![CDATA[Why do you say so?]]></string>
<string id="527372"><![CDATA[Yes. When they have agreed to give you their blood for transformation into the panacea, the Kin will help you put that blood to use. You will have at your disposal the skills of the butchers, of all who know the lines, and the Abattoir itself—Suok's womb. Burakh will not oppose it.]]></string>
<string id="527373"><![CDATA[You didn't kill Burakh?]]></string>
<string id="527374"><![CDATA[After I give my transformed blood, he will inherit my authority over the Kin.]]></string>
<string id="527375"><![CDATA[He said you'd told him to descend into the abyss.]]></string>
<string id="527376"><![CDATA[I bow to thee, Mistress. You have come to take my life. I am prepared to sacrifice it.]]></string>
<string id="527377"><![CDATA[I say what I say and do what I do because I, Oyun, have failed to perform the rite and to carry the burden I took upon myself. I am not worthy of living. Many among the Bound would tell you the same.]]></string>
<string id="527378"><![CDATA[Many?]]></string>
<string id="527379"><![CDATA[Did you call me Mistress?]]></string>
<string id="527380"><![CDATA[Warden Burakh and Oynon Rubin have told me of your miracles. She who can turn the blood of the children of Suok into the blood of Bos Primigenius is worthy of being titled our Mistress.]]></string>
<string id="527381"><![CDATA[What makes you sure they'll agree?]]></string>
<string id="527382"><![CDATA[A Mistress needs not ask. They have already accepted their fate. Let them serve their lady, the Mistress of the Humble. If you find several of such Bound, who won't resent having to give up their meaningless lives, you will create enough vital humours to keep the town alive. Do you agree to take and transform my blood?]]></string>
<string id="527383"><![CDATA[No. I will not kill him anymore.]]></string>
<string id="527384"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="527385"><![CDATA[Yes, if such is your desire.]]></string>
<string id="527387"><![CDATA[No. I don't want to.]]></string>
<string id="527465"><![CDATA[So you're the harbinger of my doom... Or will you give me some advice on how to escape my well-deserved punishment?]]></string>
<string id="527466"><![CDATA[So it is well-deserved?]]></string>
<string id="527467"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor won't forgive me for my treason. The only surprising thing is that she found out so soon. I've only just made the decision, and she knows already... That woman is indeed a devil. But in any case, I won't change my decision, even if it costs me my life.]]></string>
<string id="527468"><![CDATA[You shouldn't ascribe such a role to me.]]></string>
<string id="527469"><![CDATA[And what is your decision?]]></string>
<string id="527470"><![CDATA[I want to preserve the Polyhedron. And I will preserve it, whatever it takes.]]></string>
<string id="527471"><![CDATA[And Aglaya wants it destroyed?]]></string>
<string id="527472"><![CDATA[Yes. And this sly schemer played me so well that, but for a lucky coincidence, I myself would have now desired it above all else in the world! Her infernal design would have become my own discovery. Aglaya believes the Polyhedron to be the cause of the outbreak.]]></string>
<string id="527473"><![CDATA[And that's not so?]]></string>
<string id="527474"><![CDATA[What does it matter? It may have been the reason the epidemic began, but it's not the reason it's still there! Destroying the Tower won't stop it. One must not imagine a clash of supreme powers behind this. This is mechanics, not mysticism! That's what I've been trying to convince Peter of.]]></string>
<string id="527475"><![CDATA[And what does Peter say?]]></string>
<string id="527476"><![CDATA[He believes, as you probably know, that the epidemic is a punishment for the hubris he and his brother committed by building this masterpiece. However, he would also rather lose his life than his tower. It's too marvellous an achievement. Let all else burn; the Tower must remain!]]></string>
<string id="527477"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="527478"><![CDATA[Because for the first time in human history, a structure has been built which—owing as much to engineering calculation as to a favourable concourse of circumstances—possesses a miraculous capacity for influencing the human consciousness. It can, if you like, store the dreams of children.]]></string>
<string id="527479"><![CDATA[How is that possible?]]></string>
<string id="527480"><![CDATA[That's the thing; this tower makes the impossible possible. I didn't believe it either until I saw for myself. But the fact remains. The children are unanimous in insisting that the Tower reproduces that very spirit which turns childhood into the happiest time of a human life.]]></string>
<string id="527481"><![CDATA[If that's true, it's indeed a miracle…]]></string>
<string id="527482"><![CDATA[Yes! The elusive dreamworlds, the magical lands of fantasy, the first loves, the childhood games with their heroic deeds, their sieges and charges, escapes and transfigurations—it condenses them into a nodule of energy inside itself, which, being the creation of a child's fantasy, assumes an independent existence.]]></string>
<string id="527483"><![CDATA[What does that mean? I don't understand…]]></string>
<string id="527484"><![CDATA[Yes, this is a dream one can come back to. A fantasy unfolding in front of your eyes. A miracle that can be touched and held. There, inside it, things that are fleeting gifts in ordinary life can be captured.]]></string>
<string id="527485"><![CDATA[A miracle can't be touched and held. It's the law!]]></string>
<string id="527486"><![CDATA[A tower like that should not be destroyed.]]></string>
<string id="527487"><![CDATA[I'm asking you for a postponement. I know how to preserve the Polyhedron. Everything else here will have to be destroyed—but the Polyhedron can be saved. Tell Aglaya you haven't found me, and I'll find arguments to convince the Commander. He'll let the Polyhedron be with a clear conscience: the epidemic won't return if the Tower stands.]]></string>
<string id="527488"><![CDATA[And you can prove it to him?]]></string>
<string id="527489"><![CDATA[Give me more time, and tomorrow I'll give you a package containing arguments for the Commander.]]></string>
<string id="527490"><![CDATA[All right. Have it your way. I'll tell Aglaya I haven't found you.]]></string>
<string id="527491"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="527492"><![CDATA[...I can't believe it's you talking! Where's your usual skepticism?]]></string>
<string id="527493"><![CDATA[A dream can't be made real. The fulfilment of a wish will always be a bitter parody of a dream. Such is the law.]]></string>
<string id="527494"><![CDATA[I've been inside that tower. It's empty. Tell me, is that an illusion?]]></string>
<string id="527495"><![CDATA[No. I'm not going to give you more time. Take this package, it's for you. Die, Bachelor; such is your fate.]]></string>
<string id="527496"><![CDATA[Wait! Then help me get rid of an enemy who's about to present Aglaya with a fateful argument which will leave the Commander with no choice but to raze the Polyhedron!]]></string>
<string id="527497"><![CDATA[Who's that?]]></string>
<string id="527498"><![CDATA[Burakh, the Haruspex. He's due to finish some gruesome business today. If he succeeds, he and Aglaya will deceive Block. That is to say, Aglaya will do all the actual deceiving. Burakh is a blind tool of hers, just like I was until recently.]]></string>
<string id="527499"><![CDATA[Why is he dangerous?]]></string>
<string id="527500"><![CDATA[They'll preserve the toxic town for the sake of saving Aglaya, and raze the Polyhedron in order to have... a culprit's head to present the Powers That Be with. They'll say the cause has been eliminated. Find him and stop him!]]></string>
<string id="527501"><![CDATA[All right. You have convinced me.]]></string>
<string id="527502"><![CDATA[Go do it yourself. If you've been able to save people from the firing squad, you'll have no trouble getting rid of the Haruspex.]]></string>
<string id="527503"><![CDATA[I must stay here and complete what I've started. I have too little time left now.]]></string>
<string id="527504"><![CDATA[All right. I'll find him.]]></string>
<string id="527505"><![CDATA[I have other plans. Goodbye, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="527506"><![CDATA[Miraculously.]]></string>
<string id="527507"><![CDATA[Did you make him do it?]]></string>
<string id="527508"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="527509"><![CDATA[I am a mere instrument of fate.]]></string>
<string id="527510"><![CDATA[Why did he do it?]]></string>
<string id="527511"><![CDATA[Because everyone has a preordainment to fulfil. His is to be a sacrificial victim.]]></string>
<string id="527512"><![CDATA[Because everyone has a preordainment to fulfil. Yours is to preside over the Kin.]]></string>
<string id="527513"><![CDATA[You've turned out to be much more powerful than I thought. Why did you do this?]]></string>
<string id="527514"><![CDATA[Tell me what you're intending to do, Burakh.]]></string>
<string id="527516"><![CDATA[I must make a blood sacrifice. But I haven't settled on one yet. I don't know who it was meant to be. I must decide. That moment is probably inevitable, and it will come soon.]]></string>
<string id="527517"><![CDATA[You are a slave of the inevitable, Burakh, while I am its Mistress. Tell me what your intentions are, and I'll help you.]]></string>
<string id="527518"><![CDATA[Dankovsky said Aglaya and you had agreed to tear down the Polyhedron.]]></string>
<string id="527519"><![CDATA[I only want one thing, and that's to heal the town. The destruction of the Polyhedron was necessary, seeing as I never hoped I would defeat the Foreman.]]></string>
<string id="527520"><![CDATA[But that wasn't what happened. So what now?]]></string>
<string id="527521"><![CDATA[How were you going to save the town? It's infected and dangerous—a cancer in the body of our country.]]></string>
<string id="527522"><![CDATA[If this will save my town, I hereby agree. Tomorrow I'll be able to back it up with arguments for Aglaya. She must submit a report on the decision reached, in order to avoid being executed.]]></string>
<string id="527523"><![CDATA[But I loathe this town, Burakh. I want it to die.]]></string>
<string id="527524"><![CDATA[Is that so?]]></string>
<string id="527525"><![CDATA[Yes. So tell Aglaya. Let her in on your plan. I think she'll accept it.]]></string>
<string id="527526"><![CDATA[Where are you going to get it from?]]></string>
<string id="527527"><![CDATA[Ask Stakh Rubin about it.]]></string>
<string id="527528"><![CDATA[I transform blood with my hands. I'm a miracle-worker, Burakh.]]></string>
<string id="527529"><![CDATA[Yes, that sounds true enough. I believe you. What would you have me do?]]></string>
<string id="527530"><![CDATA[Promise me that when you become head of the Kin, you'll help me by creating as much panacea as will be needed to contain the disease.]]></string>

<string id="527538"><![CDATA[I want to ask the Foreman about the mysteries concealed in the ritual of bovine sacrifice.

<string id="527776"><![CDATA[*** They say that these odonghe Worms take part in the circulation of ichor and sap between the Earth and its children. They do not belong to themselves—and neither do their brides. However, the Earth is wiser than its children. Likewise, the brides are more sensitive to the Earth's requests than the odonghe.

Olgimskys' son Vlad the Younger will advise me the best way to approach her.]]></string>
<string id="527779"><![CDATA[Aspity is certainly not human. Rather, she may be a phantom; an emanation of a collective mind—or maybe collective madness.

<string id="527783"><![CDATA[Everything is going the way it should. Each event is a sign; no incident is coincidence. Every messenger is an envoy of the higher powers.

<string id="527785"><![CDATA[*** No, Aspity is not guilty of the outbreak. What she believes and what is real are not the same. Whatever horrible deeds she takes responsibility for, I will not be her accuser. She is destined, perhaps, to redeem herself for the evil she has caused.]]></string>

As for what properties it adds to an infusion… I don't remember. You need to know the recipes. A lot depends on the blade, too.]]></string>
<string id="527822"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="527823"><![CDATA[Each blade has its own personality, that is known. All of them are different, but the blades of each kind of herb have something in common, too. So even if you don't know how a particular blade grew, you can still risk making an infusion with it. It will have an effect.]]></string>
<string id="527824"><![CDATA[There's no medicine in drugstores?]]></string>
<string id="527825"><![CDATA[You can come across some drugs from time to time, but they're of poor quality. Someone's bought up the whole supply recently—and I've heard it was a single person, too. I wonder who would do something like that... that information could be of use. Twyre is of course no medicinal herb. Earth does not serve man; man serves Earth.]]></string>
<string id="527826"><![CDATA[Indeed.]]></string>
<string id="527827"><![CDATA[I don't think so.]]></string>
<string id="527828"><![CDATA[What is the First Outbreak?]]></string>
<string id="527829"><![CDATA[Stanislav Rubin—he was one of your father's apprentices, by the way—told me that an outbreak of a mysterious disease had already happened once in this town, an outbreak that bore many resemblances to the one that killed Simon Kain.]]></string>
<string id="527830"><![CDATA[Go on.]]></string>
<string id="527831"><![CDATA[The disease had spread through one of the poorest districts back then and was only miraculously contained. It was only raging for two or three days, but the memories it has left are still soaked with fear so strong that… well. What I'm saying is Isidor's inheritance may very well be of use.]]></string>
<string id="527832"><![CDATA[I'm not sure about that...]]></string>
<string id="527833"><![CDATA[Just the core ideas, I don't need to study them in detail. Neither do I want to. I don't believe in folk medicine. My professional assistance, on the other hand, could prove useful to you; I do, after all, know how biochemical reactions work.]]></string>
<string id="527834"><![CDATA[So?]]></string>
<string id="527835"><![CDATA[Curious. So Isidor Burakh relied on some sorf of... natural agents? He abstracted the working components from them somehow, I guess...? Or even used those agents to obtain serum from blood… Damned if I know…]]></string>
<string id="527836"><![CDATA[Come back to me after you get it; I'm sure we'll have a very lively conversation then. I have a strong suspicion you are about to stumble upon quite a few mysteries, and that I could shed some light on them. Will you come?]]></string>
<string id="527837"><![CDATA[I will.]]></string>
<string id="527838"><![CDATA[Maybe.]]></string>
<string id="527839"><![CDATA[Now I feel like a truly rich heir.]]></string>
<string id="527840"><![CDATA[I can't promise you anything. I'll just take a look.]]></string>
<string id="527841"><![CDATA[There will be a reward. Your reward. I know secrets. I know how to combine the herbs so that they'd sing together. Sing in unison, not out of sync. I'll tell you one or two.]]></string>
<string id="527842"><![CDATA[Yes. She remembered her duty.]]></string>
<string id="527843"><![CDATA[Her word and my word are kin. She says she will come back, so she will be back. I said I would give you a secret, so I give what has been promised. It's a lost secret anyway, the apostate has run off with it. A non-secret. I give it to you. Keep it well. Those who lose secrets, die.]]></string>
<string id="527844"><![CDATA[Probably.]]></string>
<string id="527845"><![CDATA[A bad choice. Neither here nor there will herbs multiply. This year will become the last good year, no more good years to come. Herbs will fade, the body of a disobedient daughter will fade. Her smooth breasts will dry up, her warm milk will dry up.]]></string>
<string id="527846"><![CDATA[Don't condemn your daughter. You will come to regret it.]]></string>
<string id="527847"><![CDATA[It's all for the better.]]></string>
<string id="527848"><![CDATA[What do you want?]]></string>
<string id="527849"><![CDATA[I am a Gatherer, and I am an oynon. I am known for my wisdom, and I have the knowledge of herb conjunctions. My daughter is a Bride, she knows how to summon herbs from the Earth. She does it well too, just look at how generous a summer we had! I've sold my daughter at a good price, I've sold her to as a wife to this Gatherer.]]></string>
<string id="527850"><![CDATA[What price did you sell her for?]]></string>
<string id="527851"><![CDATA[We have three young ones, three Gatherers. She ran off for one of them. One is to the right, across the Gullet; one is to the left, across the Guzzle. If you find her, if you make her obey my word, I will reward you. I will share a secret of herbs. Two if you insist.]]></string>
<string id="527852"><![CDATA[He is a hero. He has dealt with the traitors, with the apostates. He has returned them to the Earth, the people who have been selling my secrets to outsiders. But my daughter didn't come to his house as a wife. She doesn't want to bring him riches, she doesn't want to summon herbs for him.]]></string>
<string id="527853"><![CDATA[What do you want from me?]]></string>
<string id="527854"><![CDATA[That was her choice, and I can get behind that.]]></string>
<string id="527855"><![CDATA[So she doesn't listen to you but will listen to me?]]></string>
<string id="527856"><![CDATA[You are a Warden. You know the lines. Tell her that this is where her line of fortune lies. She will listen.]]></string>
<string id="527857"><![CDATA[Is that him over there? An unusual choice…]]></string>
<string id="527858"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="527859"><![CDATA[...You are a menkhu. You know the lines. Fine. I will follow. Let me say my goodbyes, and I'll come.]]></string>

<string id="527862"><![CDATA[There was a brand, wasn't there? And the documents bearing the same mark… that designates a secret name.]]></string>
<string id="527863"><![CDATA[Indeed. How do you know that?]]></string>

<string id="527865"><![CDATA[You could get out of here when it's dark.]]></string>
<string id="527866"><![CDATA[I haven't quite got the hang of it...]]></string>
<string id="527867"><![CDATA[I need it so bloody much! How did you know?]]></string>
<string id="527868"><![CDATA[What is it about then? Allow me to kindly remind you that there are a lot of people here who do not shy away from piercing others with knives in the street! Yet during an emergency the people who look more or less modern and civilized are disallowing me, a fully-trained medic, to dissect bodies!]]></string>
<string id="527869"><![CDATA[They won't let you dissect the dead?]]></string>
<string id="527870"><![CDATA[It's an ancient tradition. Its roots are religious in nature. Or even mythological.]]></string>
<string id="527871"><![CDATA[Bloody brilliant! Well, I don't profess any local religion! I'm fighting an epidemic. Or rather I'm trying to save a couple thousand people even though they turn themselves inside out doing their best to get in my way!]]></string>
<string id="527872"><![CDATA[Wait a bit...]]></string>
<string id="527873"><![CDATA[We run, no stops, time is short. Hopefully we don't run into them on our way... You'll probably fight back well enough though.]]></string>
<string id="527874"><![CDATA[My name is Sticky.]]></string>
<string id="527875"><![CDATA[Nice to meet you.]]></string>
<string id="527876"><![CDATA[Hmm… Do you know how to get in there or something?]]></string>
<string id="527877"><![CDATA[Nope! And I'm a master of this trade, y'know! It's embarrassing... I'm Sticky by the way, you may have heard of me.]]></string>
<string id="527878"><![CDATA[I'm Burakh. Isidor's son. You have heard of him for sure.]]></string>
<string id="527881"><![CDATA[What's so costly about it?]]></string>
<string id="527882"><![CDATA[The… the field gear. Trust me, I'm not trying to swindle you.]]></string>
<string id="527886"><![CDATA[What kind of a payment is that?]]></string>
<string id="527887"><![CDATA[It's all in the interests of the scouts who make the map, Burakh. They're being threatened. They get killed by precisely those people, the barbers. Get it?]]></string>
<string id="527889"><![CDATA[No, to hell with that.]]></string>
<string id="527890"><![CDATA[Can you imagine? The Skinners district is completely empty! No disease there anymore—like there's never been any. Weird, right? Sticky is on cloud nine, no doubt about that! I'm worried about him though…]]></string>
<string id="527891"><![CDATA[Interesting... What does the district look like now?]]></string>
<string id="527892"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="527893"><![CDATA[All right, I've changed my mind. How many crowbars did you say you wanted?]]></string>
<string id="527894"><![CDATA[Four will do. Chances are it's as many as there are. Four men have definitely been seen.]]></string>
<string id="527895"><![CDATA[Fine. Wait for me.]]></string>
<string id="527896"><![CDATA[Here you are. You meant these crowbars, right?]]></string>
<string id="527897"><![CDATA[Yep, just the stuff. I'll keep my word. Here you are. Our potluck, as they say…]]></string>
<string id="527898"><![CDATA[Thank you. Hang them up on the wall.]]></string>
<string id="527899"><![CDATA[Crowbars like these?]]></string>
<string id="527900"><![CDATA[Gee! Ain't you a fast fellow… I'll keep my word. Here you are. Our potluck, as they say…]]></string>
<string id="527901"><![CDATA[Thank you. Hang them up on a wall.]]></string>
<string id="527902"><![CDATA[Marauders all over the place! Houses are still standing unlocked, just like they were yesterday! So they're grabbing what they can! I bet they're going to gang up together soon. Killed a good fellow not too long ago, they did, and Wrick's big brother as well. That's who I'd like to go to war with!]]></string>
<string id="527903"><![CDATA[Why so bloodthirsty?]]></string>
<string id="527904"><![CDATA[It's not blood but justice I'm thirsty for. They go around killing people—and evil must be repaid with evil. We'd love to go there but... there's business to be done. And now I'm worried about Sticky—he wouldn't think twice before crossing them! Have you thought about giving them a thrashing?]]></string>
<string id="527905"><![CDATA[There's a good chance I'd end up as the thrashee…]]></string>
<string id="527906"><![CDATA[They say they've got these totally awesome crowbars—nicked them from the works. I can offer a bounty on every marauder—this I announce publicly. Whoever brings four marauders' crowbars will get... well, I'll reward them well, that's for sure.]]></string>
<string id="527907"><![CDATA[Yes, they probably deserve to be fought with.]]></string>
<string id="527908"><![CDATA[An intriguing proposal. Consider it accepted.]]></string>
<string id="527909"><![CDATA[No thanks. I will do without it.]]></string>
<string id="527910"><![CDATA[I'm no fool to waste my time like that.]]></string>
<string id="527912"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="527913"><![CDATA[They say the Sand Pest is so terrible that it makes people die of pain. They feel like they're drowning in boiling oil. Giving painkillers to these poor souls is a dangerous and perhaps even heroic feat. Go to an infected area and help the agonizing!]]></string>
<string id="527914"><![CDATA[Who is Sticky?]]></string>
<string id="527915"><![CDATA[Well, there's this guy... Haven't I told you already? He's always looking for trouble. We aren't friends or anything, but I do have a lot of respect for him.]]></string>
<string id="527916"><![CDATA[So what's going on in that district now?]]></string>
<string id="527917"><![CDATA[I know that already. And?]]></string>
<string id="527918"><![CDATA[Break a leg to you too.]]></string>
<string id="527919"><![CDATA[Rubin's made a discovery about you. You should see how they're fussing now! Walking about and bribing the kids and sending out messengers. As if we were on the eve of a battle, no less. And it's all to do with you.]]></string>
<string id="527920"><![CDATA[Why do you think so?]]></string>
<string id="527921"><![CDATA[They're all Clara this, Clara that, and how it'll be the worst thing in the world if you slip away. Two of the lads have heard Rubin and the Bachelor having an argument about you—so heated they almost got into a fight.]]></string>
<string id="527922"><![CDATA[What do they want from me, anyway?]]></string>
<string id="527923"><![CDATA[Who's "they"?]]></string>
<string id="527924"><![CDATA[Well, Rubin, Burakh, the Bachelor, the whole medical bunch. Didn't they tell you anything?]]></string>
<string id="527925"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="527926"><![CDATA[So they're being sly about it. Probably want to con you; or they'd have got in touch with you long ago. Or have you been hiding?]]></string>
<string id="527927"><![CDATA[I haven't!]]></string>
<string id="527928"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="527929"><![CDATA[Pity about the "almost".]]></string>
<string id="527930"><![CDATA[I'm telling you, Stakh Rubin's found out something about you. Or maybe you've done something nasty? Not that he'd be in a position to judge you if you did... Pot calling the kettle black and all that. Same goes for the rest of those gentlemen... And you, what do you think?]]></string>
<string id="527931"><![CDATA[I'm going to find out what's going on.]]></string>
<string id="527932"><![CDATA[Well, I've warned you, so my work here is done. Will you join our gang?]]></string>
<string id="527933"><![CDATA[I might.]]></string>
<string id="527934"><![CDATA[No. I won't.]]></string>
<string id="527935"><![CDATA[I'm studying you.]]></string>
<string id="527936"><![CDATA[What are you up to?]]></string>
<string id="527937"><![CDATA[Me? Nothing special. The only thing of interest that's keeping me here now is the role Rubin's discovery will play in determining the fate of the Polyhedron.]]></string>
<string id="527939"><![CDATA[Gone to The Crucible with the good news. And considering that the only good news as far as the Kains are concerned would be that Simon was still alive, he probably knows how to resurrect Simon and save the town from the Commander's cannons. Otherwise, it's suicidal.]]></string>
<string id="527940"><![CDATA[And what do I have to do with it?]]></string>
<string id="527941"><![CDATA[I don't know. I think you're part of his calculus. Clara, could he be counting on your help in implementing his plan?]]></string>
<string id="527942"><![CDATA[I know everything.]]></string>
<string id="527943"><![CDATA[Really? Then will you perhaps explain me everything? Because I'm still in the dark. Rubin's been postponing the explaining until after his theory's proven.]]></string>
<string id="527944"><![CDATA[Where is he himself?]]></string>
<string id="527945"><![CDATA[What discovery?]]></string>
<string id="527946"><![CDATA[Rubin believes he has uncovered your secret. He reached that conclusion after studying the inner structure of Simon Kain.]]></string>
<string id="527947"><![CDATA[And where is he himself?]]></string>
<string id="527948"><![CDATA[Suicidal? Why?]]></string>
<string id="527949"><![CDATA[Because the glorious Kain clan's cards have been reshuffled. Georgiy and Victor have faded away: family tradition requires them to perform some kind of a duty that will soon, if not already, result in their demise. Maria's calling the shots now.]]></string>
<string id="527950"><![CDATA[Does she have a reason to dislike Rubin?]]></string>
<string id="527953"><![CDATA[And when will Rubin be back?]]></string>
<string id="527954"><![CDATA[Quite likely never.]]></string>
<string id="527955"><![CDATA[I can foresee that she'll have a reason to dislike his discovery. Maria is quite content with the way things stand now. If Georgiy and Victor sacrifice themselves to the memory of their departed—guess who gets to rule?]]></string>
<string id="527956"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="527957"><![CDATA[Does this mean Rubin knows how to bring Simon back?]]></string>
<string id="527958"><![CDATA[Simon is not simply dead; he was pulverized into atoms, and drops of him are now coursing through the veins of several hundred people. Even a miracle-worker can't resurrect someone who's in this state. Which means that Rubin is proposing a half-measure that will hardly impress Maria enough to make her refuse.]]></string>
<string id="527959"><![CDATA[Will you go with me?]]></string>
<string id="527960"><![CDATA[I see…]]></string>
<string id="527961"><![CDATA[If you're interested to know what Rubin has found out about you, you'd better hurry.]]></string>
<string id="527962"><![CDATA[And you?]]></string>
<string id="527963"><![CDATA[I have other plans. Rubin is doing one stupid thing after another. The fact that he's relying completely on you but still hasn't let you know about it, is more proof that Rubin is primarily seeking to atone for his wrongdoing against the Kains. I wouldn't want to interfere.]]></string>
<string id="527964"><![CDATA[We have transferred our power to her. Or do you doubt her entitlement to it? The process has already begun, and it is irreversible. Let her judge! With her inner eye, she sees what Georgiy and Victor can no longer see. They are not their own masters anymore.]]></string>
<string id="527965"><![CDATA[Where?]]></string>
<string id="527966"><![CDATA["They"? Who?]]></string>
<string id="527967"><![CDATA[Georgiy and Victor. Are you not listening to me, little girl? Ha ha ha ha ha!]]></string>
<string id="527968"><![CDATA[Who's inside him? What devilry is this?]]></string>
<string id="527969"><![CDATA[Who is this speaking? Who are you?]]></string>
<string id="527970"><![CDATA[And who are you? Ha ha ha…! You are in no position to ask such questions! Get out. I'm sick of you already.]]></string>
<string id="527971"><![CDATA[Oh my…]]></string>
<string id="527972"><![CDATA['Yes. But he was taken away on Maria's orders.]]></string>
<string id="527973"><![CDATA[That I do not know. Or care to know.]]></string>
<string id="527974"><![CDATA[And who does know?]]></string>

<string id="527978"><![CDATA['Where?]]></string>
<string id="527979"><![CDATA['I don't know. I don't concern myself with such things. Perhaps Victor will know more. Or it was Maria's own decision. Apparently they've taken all of our servants off their duties for that—I've been trying to summon the couriers for half an hour already!]]></string>
<string id="527980"><![CDATA['Did he say anything about me?]]></string>
<string id="527981"><![CDATA['He proposed interesting things... He declared that Simon was not lost to us... which I knew already, of course. He said that Simon had been precious to him not as a person, but because of the prodigious powers he possessed... powers that can supposedly be brought back to life in another human being. It was then that he mentioned your name.]]></string>
<string id="527982"><![CDATA['Why?]]></string>
<string id="527983"><![CDATA['That I do not know. Our conversation was interrupted by Maria. Her powers are growing by the day. She didn't believe him and went on to accuse him of sacrilege. She called you, Clara, a spawn of hell. Maria said that whoever would talk to you would be talking to death. Is it true?]]></string>
<string id="527984"><![CDATA['So who will have to part with their life?]]></string>

The blessed, blossoming Chaos, a nourishing source of growth, creativity and love, the gracious womb of a future life... Maria will overpower the pestilence and restore the city.]]></string>
<string id="527988"><![CDATA['Why did she accuse him?]]></string>
<string id="527989"><![CDATA['Rubin spoke with passion, with fury even—and the sum and substance of his speech was that we don't have to take pains and part with our lives in order to preserve the Memory of Simon. She didn't like the idea... After all, it involved Nina too. Maria had loved her mother quite madly.]]></string>
<string id="527990"><![CDATA['Why aren't you afraid of talking to me then?]]></string>

<string id="527993"><![CDATA['And you? Why not you?]]></string>
<string id="527994"><![CDATA['Because two souls cannot survive for long in a single body. Do you not feel it yourself? You of all people ought to understand it with the utmost clarity.

<string id="528038"><![CDATA[You can see for yourself that it's the acme of all human achievement. The Tower is no chimera, no oddity, no trick—whatever heartless Daniil might think! It was made for people; it is needed by people; it has no meaning without people!]]></string>
<string id="528039"><![CDATA[Why the shouting? Why are you so passionate about it?]]></string>
<string id="528040"><![CDATA[So you don't trust me? But I've changed…]]></string>
<string id="528041"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="528042"><![CDATA[The Bachelor will tell you everything... I can't talk right now…]]></string>
<string id="528043"><![CDATA[What is it, this Polyhedron of yours?]]></string>
<string id="528044"><![CDATA[Why would I talk about it? What do you know about miracles? You say that you can perform them yourself, that you are yourself a power capable of making miracles an everyday occurrence; well, others aren't like that! Rarely do we get a chance to make the impossible happen.]]></string>
<string id="528045"><![CDATA[I want to save your Tower…]]></string>
<string id="528046"><![CDATA[I see you don't trust me…]]></string>
<string id="528047"><![CDATA["The Bound"]]></string>
<string id="528048"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor was surprised, but still willing to hear me out. This is good, for I won't manage without her support. However, in order to secure her friendship I first need to bring her the head of Bachelor Dankovsky. An enormous price.]]></string>
<string id="528049"><![CDATA[The Bachelor went to visit the soldiers. He seems troubled by what is happening among the military. However, I don't think he was able to sneak by the Commander... I wonder what is happening there right now?]]></string>
<string id="528050"><![CDATA[Dankovsky is trying to rescue the architect, Andrey Stamatin. He was captured by the mutineers who took control of the field gun.]]></string>
<string id="528051"><![CDATA[I must heal the dying officer. He is the only person in this abyss who knows what has happened to the Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="528052"><![CDATA[The officer is saved. He is breathing; his heart is beating.]]></string>
<string id="528053"><![CDATA[The Bachelor can be found in Peter Stamatin's workshop.]]></string>
<string id="528054"><![CDATA[The Bachelor is willing to help me. He values these kinds of alliances dearly, it seems; he has asked me to bring him Burakh's head.]]></string>
<string id="528055"><![CDATA[Burakh says I should bring him the head of the Foreman.]]></string>
<string id="528056"><![CDATA[Finally, the lines did meet. The first of the fallen Bound ones, that monstrous Foreman—who won't hesitate to give his life—has recognised the Mistress of the Earth in me. He is willing to sacrifice himself for the possibility of a miracle. I can return to Burakh now, I have freed the subterranean throne for him!]]></string>
<string id="528057"><![CDATA[My plan will come to fruition. I was capable of taming the demons, even though their hatred for each other remains. I can return to Aglaya Lilich now.]]></string>
<string id="528058"><![CDATA[This is the end. Aglaya commands me to leave the town at once. But why? What's wrong with my strategy? Is this because my plan answers the goals of the Powers That Be too well... What kind of an Inquisitor is she? She is nothing but a vengeful, malicious impostor! What can I do now, but collapse at the feet of the Commander and beg for protection?]]></string>
<string id="528059"><![CDATA[The final journey lies ahead. It is time to reap what was sown. The Foreman was the first sacrifice. Six more are needed. Seven sinners would be enough to save the town.]]></string>
<string id="528060"><![CDATA[I still require five Bound ones willing to give their lives for the town to thrive and prosper as it did before.]]></string>
<string id="528061"><![CDATA[I still require four Bound ones willing to give their lives for the town to thrive and prosper as it did before.]]></string>
<string id="528062"><![CDATA[I still require three Bound ones willing to give their lives for the town to thrive and prosper as it did before.]]></string>
<string id="528063"><![CDATA[I still require two Bound ones willing to give their lives for the town to thrive and prosper as it did before.]]></string>
<string id="528064"><![CDATA[I need one last Bound willing to give his or her life for the town to thrive and prosper as it did before.]]></string>
<string id="528065"><![CDATA[This is the end. Aglaya commands me to leave the town at once. But why? What's wrong with my strategy? Is this because my plan answers the goals of the Powers That Be too well... What kind of an Inquisitor is she? She is nothing but a vengeful, malicious impostor! What can I do now, but collapse at the feet of the Commander and beg for protection?]]></string>
<string id="528066"><![CDATA[*** The preparations are complete! Tomorrow, the miracle may come to pass! I would be happy beyond measure, were it not for this awkward premonition that freezes my heart still... I can perform miracles! Just let me...]]></string>
<string id="528067"><![CDATA[I'd advise against it. Doesn't lend itself well to a long life.]]></string>
<string id="528068"><![CDATA[A prisoner has been brought here recently!]]></string>
<string id="528069"><![CDATA[Were you among those who accompanied Rubin?]]></string>
<string id="528070"><![CDATA[Yes. I was.]]></string>
<string id="528071"><![CDATA[How did you get here?]]></string>
<string id="528072"><![CDATA[I was covering the retreat of my comrades. And I'm proud of it.]]></string>
<string id="528073"><![CDATA[No. Where is it?]]></string>
<string id="528074"><![CDATA[A cellar under the Rolling Mill. Look here, I'll show you.]]></string>
<string id="528075"><![CDATA[Yes. I'm sure I do.]]></string>
<string id="528076"><![CDATA[Has a doctor, Stanislav Rubin, been brought here? He was likely accompanied by several armed people.]]></string>
<string id="528077"><![CDATA[Yes, indeed. A giant of a man dressed in leather. He was dragged along by twelve people. Was he really a doctor? What had he done to earn such honours?]]></string>
<string id="528078"><![CDATA[Yes, he's a doctor! What's happened to him?]]></string>
<string id="528079"><![CDATA[They demanded in an insolent manner that we place him under arrest. I prohibited that and demanded an explanation from them; I ordered all of them brought here. They refused. A gunfight ensued. We shot four of them and captured three. The rest managed to vanish with the prisoner amid the commotion.]]></string>
<string id="528080"><![CDATA[...May I talk to the men you captured?]]></string>
<string id="528081"><![CDATA[You may. I will issue an order to let you into the jail. But be careful; they say it's dangerous inside. Infection.]]></string>
<string id="528082"><![CDATA[Why do you need him?]]></string>
<string id="528083"><![CDATA[He promised to say where Rubin had been taken.]]></string>
<string id="528084"><![CDATA[Yes? Let him speak while facing the barrel of a rifle. Why release a dangerous rascal with violent proclivities?]]></string>
<string id="528085"><![CDATA[I've promised him freedom.]]></string>
<string id="528086"><![CDATA[He wouldn't talk. Pride.]]></string>
<string id="528088"><![CDATA[Certainly.]]></string>
<string id="528089"><![CDATA[Thank you!]]></string>
<string id="528090"><![CDATA[Go to the prisoner. I'll order him released.]]></string>
<string id="528094"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="528095"><![CDATA[Here you are, sweet child. I've heard a lot about you. So you are the girl who's cured dozens of people with her holiness, while also being persecuted and hounded for it by the unruly rabble?]]></string>
<string id="528096"><![CDATA[Yes. That's right.]]></string>
<string id="528097"><![CDATA[The base rabble always trample what they don't understand. Always repay for a heroic deed with ingratitude. They ought to be spoken to in a different language. And I swear they will be! From now on I'm not letting you out of my sight. You need reliable protection.]]></string>
<string id="528098"><![CDATA[There's no need for that! See, I'm unharmed; that's because I'm invulnerable.]]></string>
<string id="528099"><![CDATA[I won't allow anyone to harm you.]]></string>
<string id="528100"><![CDATA[No one's ever said anything like this to me before…]]></string>
<string id="528105"><![CDATA[It's not their fault! They just mistook me for someone else.]]></string>
<string id="528106"><![CDATA[That doesn't excuse them in the slightest.]]></string>
<string id="528107"><![CDATA[Besides, they were frightened…]]></string>
<string id="528108"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="528109"><![CDATA[It's all because of me! He discovered a way of saving people, that was however unprofitable to those he trusted!]]></string>
<string id="528110"><![CDATA[That explains a great deal. In any case, those who brought him in didn't exactly strike me as pleasant people. I even had to resort to harsh measures.]]></string>
<string id="528111"><![CDATA[What happened?]]></string>
<string id="528112"><![CDATA[Can't you see yourself? I was walking out of my lair... Was passing by this workshop when I heard a noise, and there were those six or seven men dragging Stakh away. I had to take on them... Sadly, I didn't help Stakh in the end. Couldn't push my way through to him.]]></string>
<string id="528113"><![CDATA[They've taken him again?]]></string>
<string id="528114"><![CDATA[Yes... and got away. I was pinned down by three of them... or was it four? The others took him away... I gave them quite a thrashing but got roughed up myself. Looks like a damaged knee and a broken ankle... But perhaps it'll be all right... I just wish I could get Stakh out! Could you tell... Vlad the Younger, at the very least?]]></string>
<string id="528115"><![CDATA[Where have they taken him?]]></string>
<string id="528116"><![CDATA[Could the Bachelor help?]]></string>
<string id="528117"><![CDATA[Perhaps I should tell Grief?]]></string>
<string id="528118"><![CDATA[No... That one's shrewd... and has plans of his own. Which apparently don't involve Stakh anymore... He's become useless to everyone... no one even remembers it was him who made the vaccine! He let the Bachelor take all the credit so that he had something to brag about in front of Aglaya... So that's that.]]></string>
<string id="528119"><![CDATA[I'll go myself. Don't worry, I'll manage. Where could they have taken him?]]></string>
<string id="528120"><![CDATA[Is that the one where the Theatre is?]]></string>
<string id="528121"><![CDATA[Yes. I can guess why—there's a certain place there... I wandered into it once, a maze underneath the Knots... Vlad the Younger had made one of the creepholes when he dug his well, and the other one was on the rear side, behind the Theatre... It was there that I saw that creature... that apparition. The Rat Prophet.]]></string>
<string id="528122"><![CDATA[Why would they go to the Theatre? It's been turned into a hospital... of sorts.]]></string>
<string id="528123"><![CDATA[The Theatre's most likely run by Maria... The place is hers. She's in conspiracy with Mark. So she had them go there.]]></string>
<string id="528124"><![CDATA[The Rat Prophet was there?]]></string>
<string id="528125"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="528126"><![CDATA[Did he show you the way out?]]></string>
<string id="528127"><![CDATA[I'm not the Plague!]]></string>
<string id="528128"><![CDATA[I choose the past.]]></string>
<string id="528129"><![CDATA[I always choose the future.]]></string>
<string id="528130"><![CDATA[Careful, it may be a bad call... What do you need Rubin for?]]></string>
<string id="528131"><![CDATA[I'm going to decide his fate. As was preordained.]]></string>
<string id="528132"><![CDATA[I need his help.]]></string>
<string id="528133"><![CDATA[Rubin rests underground—and it doesn't seem like he's getting out of there any time soon. Are you sure you want to join him?]]></string>
<string id="528134"><![CDATA[You know, I've been thinking about you all this time. Do you know what your hands are capable of doing?]]></string>
<string id="528135"><![CDATA[Yes. I work miracles and heal the sick.]]></string>
<string id="528136"><![CDATA[You transform blood, Clara. You could turn any of the Bound into the kind of being that even Simon was not. I don't know how it happens, but your hands enrich a person's blood with corpuscles that don't occur in ordinary people. This blood can fight the disease.]]></string>
<string id="528137"><![CDATA[Perhaps…]]></string>
<string id="528138"><![CDATA[This means that if we agree, we can defend the town from both the disease and the army cannons. Here's a way. You can transform Bound volunteers. Their blood will then be spent to make the panacea. It's cruel, but some of the Bound will agree.]]></string>
<string id="528139"><![CDATA[So the town's going to turn into a kind of shrine demanding continuous sacrifice?]]></string>
<string id="528140"><![CDATA[Isn't it all the same to you, Rubin?]]></string>
<string id="528141"><![CDATA[Yes. I bring death.]]></string>
<string id="528142"><![CDATA[Now listen to me. Burakh has uncovered the secret to his father's panacea. He was running short on blood; he'd looked everywhere but couldn't find a being whose blood would combine all the necessary qualities. Blood that could stop the bacteria from multiplying and smother the disease.]]></string>
<string id="528143"><![CDATA[And so my hands create that kind of blood?]]></string>
<string id="528144"><![CDATA[Yes. Simon, the all-but-perfect human being, had the same blood. But it was weak. Simon was very old. In all the other respects, his blood was like what Burakh sought after. A holy blood, which he still desires, still tries to wrestle from Foreman Oyun.]]></string>
<string id="528145"><![CDATA[What does this mean?]]></string>
<string id="528146"><![CDATA[Why do we specifically need the Bound?]]></string>
<string id="528147"><![CDATA[I suppose the predisposition in their blood was what made them Bound in the first place. Perfect people with perfect blood. We have to find volunteers among the Bound who'd sacrifice themselves. Simple people from the street won't do; that's been verified.]]></string>
<string id="528148"><![CDATA[Miracles violate the world; they're abusive in nature. When the world was conceived, it was conceived as a coherent whole, without contradictions. Harmony is the main, indeed the only component of any Universe. However ugly a world may be, however unfair it may seem—it is nonetheless harmonious!]]></string>
<string id="528149"><![CDATA[Look around you! Or is this what you call harmony?]]></string>
<string id="528150"><![CDATA[And who do you think you are, daring to interfere in a supreme design? What could the consequences be of your meaningless actions?]]></string>
<string id="528151"><![CDATA[I…]]></string>
<string id="528152"><![CDATA[Driven by either compassion or anger, you've had the audacity to tamper crudely with the finest fabric of creation, severing and rebinding threads that aren't for you to sever or rebind, it being the prerogative of a thousandfold greater mind than all of our paltry ones combined!]]></string>
<string id="528153"><![CDATA[You…]]></string>
<string id="528154"><![CDATA[And yet I hope that you're highly overrating yourself. There's a different account of the same events, isn't there? Equally convincing arguments have been put forward in support of the claim that you are disease incarnate—its personification, such as have been known throughout history.]]></string>
<string id="528155"><![CDATA[That's not what I am!]]></string>
<string id="528156"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="528157"><![CDATA[Bring her in, let me take a closer look at her... Well, I've expected more than this. Much more. You look nothing like a messenger of the Supreme Power. So how can you prove you're a true miracle-worker, and not just an unsightly changeling pretending to be one?]]></string>
<string id="528158"><![CDATA[My deeds speak for themselves.]]></string>
<string id="528159"><![CDATA[All that your deeds suggest is that you're a dangerous fraud. Is anyone prepared to vouch for you—other than the Bachelor, who you could easily have swayed?]]></string>
<string id="528160"><![CDATA[The ones I've cured.]]></string>
<string id="528161"><![CDATA[Commoners? And who's going to go around looking for them amid all this chaos? It's certainly beyond my resources. Well then? How do I know you're you?]]></string>
<string id="528162"><![CDATA[But such things need no proof...]]></string>
<string id="528163"><![CDATA[Look at me and you shall behold.]]></string>
<string id="528164"><![CDATA[Ha ha ha... Who do you fancy yourself? Now this is too much. There is no need for such comparisons. But perhaps you're just insane?]]></string>
<string id="528165"><![CDATA[I don't know…]]></string>
<string id="528166"><![CDATA[All right, your word will be enough. Make a statement, then. Enunciate your identity. Who are you?]]></string>
<string id="528167"><![CDATA[My name is Clara. I am the Miracle-Worker.]]></string>
<string id="528168"><![CDATA[I am Clara. I am a barb on the tip of the Spear of Destiny! Beware of me, inquisitor!]]></string>
<string id="528169"><![CDATA[If someone dares to condemn me—I will bring my witnesses!]]></string>
<string id="528171"><![CDATA[Who's deceiving me? Do you mean the Saburovs? ]]></string>
<string id="528172"><![CDATA[No. The Powers That Be. They deceived you, like they did everyone else. The Saburovs are also victims of their scheming. They, the Saburovs, wanted to use you to strike at the disease carrier. But you shouldn't have killed anyone. No member of the Circle is to blame for the outbreak. The logic of the world is. Such is the Law.]]></string>
<string id="528174"><![CDATA[...I made the sister up. I never had one.]]></string>
<string id="528175"><![CDATA[My oh my... You know what, tell me about your past, girl. Who are your mother and father, where are you from? What did you do before you came here? Who saw you on your way?]]></string>
<string id="528176"><![CDATA[...I can't. I don't know who's acting under my guise right now. I can only feel their hands.]]></string>
<string id="528177"><![CDATA[...So you won't tell? Then I will. You are insane, my child. Deranged. You have a split personality disorder. Schizophrenia, perhaps. What you think of as reality is sometimes replaced by an illusion, to reappear in its true vivid fullness later. A nice version, isn't it? An all-round nice one! The only thing it can't explain is your still being alive...]]></string>
<string id="528178"><![CDATA[Yes, we have things to talk about…]]></string>
<string id="528179"><![CDATA[And mind you, I need you here with a report before the end of today! Or else I'll kill you.]]></string>
<string id="528180"><![CDATA[What have I ever done to you?]]></string>
<string id="528181"><![CDATA[I've been sent here to smother the disease and reinstate the Law. Plague or miracle-worker, in my eyes you're a menace either way. I won't go soft on you. Remember, I'm keeping you on a long leash.]]></string>
<string id="528182"><![CDATA[I won't! They're my mother and father…]]></string>
<string id="528183"><![CDATA[Oh yes you will. Have they not betrayed you? Have they not disowned you? Have they not thrown you out of the house they had told you earlier to call your own? Some parents! Don't deny it. I know everything.]]></string>
<string id="528184"><![CDATA[You're leaving me no choice…]]></string>
<string id="528185"><![CDATA[Possibly.]]></string>
<string id="528186"><![CDATA[Of course you have. I'll tell you a little secret: there was no way you could have failed at it.]]></string>
<string id="528187"><![CDATA[How is that possible?]]></string>
<string id="528188"><![CDATA[So what happens now?]]></string>
<string id="528189"><![CDATA[I'm going to give you three tests. I'm going to send you to the three grimmest loci in this town, the foundations of the three pillars its mystery rests upon. Three symbols, representing the three worlds it's made up of... Your encounters with each of the three will reveal your essence in its fullness.]]></string>
<string id="528190"><![CDATA[Don't be baffled by the oddness of the tasks I'm giving you. I'm going to watch your behaviour. Just act naturally, and I'll observe and draw conclusions. You've already almost completed the first of my tasks.]]></string>
<string id="528191"><![CDATA[I don't understand…]]></string>
<string id="528192"><![CDATA[Do you know who the Powers That Be are?]]></string>
<string id="528193"><![CDATA[Why do you have so little regard for the Saburovs?]]></string>
<string id="528194"><![CDATA[I see…]]></string>
<string id="528195"><![CDATA[You don't need to know that. The Powers That Be are those who sent me and the Bachelor here—along with one more queen piece, a proud rider on a fire-breathing steed. He's already near. You'll meet him yet.]]></string>
<string id="528196"><![CDATA[And why did they deceive everyone?]]></string>
<string id="528197"><![CDATA[They'd like to preserve this town. In the exact state it's in now. It's critical to them.]]></string>
<string id="528198"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="528199"><![CDATA[You see, there are beings who think on a wholly different scale. For them, the country consists of towns and cities, not people. And then there are those for whom the world consists of continents, not towns and cities. But one has to give it to them that this town deserves special treatment.]]></string>
<string id="528200"><![CDATA[By virtue of what?]]></string>
<string id="528201"><![CDATA[Take a look at it. Look at its tight and harmonious blend of every era of humanity. Its reflection of every facet of human existence. Its well-proportioned combination of good and evil: a straight footpath between heaven and hell.]]></string>
<string id="528202"><![CDATA[That's true of any town.]]></string>
<string id="528203"><![CDATA[A smart observation—and yet this town manifests it particularly vividly. So vividly that, for all its provincial ugliness, it can aspire to become a magical model of the universe. It's destined to become a warning. A pretend-play rehearsal of our eventual common fate.]]></string>
<string id="528204"><![CDATA[Now I understand…]]></string>
<string id="528205"><![CDATA[Because I don't like presumptuous fools. Human lives are valuable to me. To this day, I've been paying for my kind-heartedness.]]></string>
<string id="528206"><![CDATA[You shouldn't blame them... They did what they believed to be their duty.]]></string>
<string id="528207"><![CDATA[What will you task me with today?]]></string>
<string id="528208"><![CDATA[You've mesmerized people before, with quite some success. This really speaks in support of your being... exceptional. Today you're going to test your powers on a monster. You will meet Oyun, the Foreman of the Abattoir.]]></string>
<string id="528209"><![CDATA[Is he not human?]]></string>
<string id="528210"><![CDATA[An equal blend of human and beast. As I understood from esteemed Boös Olgimsky's account, his father had been begotten on a Steppe woman by a bull. He is thus a chimera... a vivid epitome of this town. If the town were to get a coat of arms, the Foreman should be on it.]]></string>
<string id="528211"><![CDATA[My God…]]></string>
<string id="528212"><![CDATA[Find out whether he is guilty. Also try to assess how much of a threat he is.]]></string>
<string id="528213"><![CDATA[A threat to what?]]></string>
<string id="528214"><![CDATA[To whom, rather... To the one who will have a lot of dealings with him. To sum up, I will need a psychological portrait of this... being. Gain his trust and learn as much as you can.]]></string>
<string id="528215"><![CDATA[Aren't you afraid that I could deceive you?]]></string>
<string id="528216"><![CDATA[I'm not. I would learn a great deal more of what I need to know from your deceit than from your honesty, with a few added touches to your own portrait. By the way, let me tell you a little secret about yourself, the first key to unravelling your mystery. You are entirely incapable of deceit.]]></string>
<string id="528217"><![CDATA[How am I to get inside the Abattoir?]]></string>
<string id="528218"><![CDATA[These passages open and close at random, as if controlled by a kind of paranormal sphincter. It looks like a hole, but no human can get through: the mental barrier is impassable even to me.]]></string>
<string id="528219"><![CDATA[What conclusions have you drawn from my behaviour yesterday?]]></string>
<string id="528220"><![CDATA[You are not as simple as I thought.]]></string>

<string id="528223"><![CDATA[What do you want to task me with now?]]></string>
<string id="528224"><![CDATA[Does that mean I'm a Mistress?]]></string>
<string id="528225"><![CDATA[The only one around who could be described as a "mistress" is, at the present moment, me.]]></string>
<string id="528226"><![CDATA[How am I to get inside the Abattoir?]]></string>
<string id="528227"><![CDATA[So what am I supposed to do?]]></string>
<string id="528228"><![CDATA[Find a girl at the Termitary who goes by the name of the Mother Superior. Come up with something to make her let you pass. I suppose you'd handle a small child without any difficulty. However, I wouldn't advise you to try your spells on her. She's Steppe-born, and a special kind of Steppe-born...

<string id="528231"><![CDATA[Seen him and lived? Let me take a look at you... Widen that pupil, look into the light... So what did you talk about?]]></string>

<string id="528241"><![CDATA[Oh, poor dear... They hate you? Really? I'm beginning to feel for you. But don't worry. You're now under my protection. They won't dare harm you. Avoid Maria, though... The niece is unpredictable.]]></string>
<string id="528242"><![CDATA[What? What did you say?]]></string>
<string id="528243"><![CDATA[Quiet. Don't be so twitchy. Then, find out from them how to get inside the Polyhedron, and do. Once you're in there, do whatever you want. In short, it's the usual thing. I'll find out what I want to find out one way or another.]]></string>
<string id="528244"><![CDATA[May I ask you a question?]]></string>
<string id="528245"><![CDATA[A single one.]]></string>
<string id="528246"><![CDATA[All right. I will do it all.]]></string>
<string id="528247"><![CDATA[What do you need this for?]]></string>
<string id="528248"><![CDATA[Firstly, I want to lure the Kains out of their entrenched defences. Secondly, I'm interested in an impartial opinion on the Polyhedron. You ought to agree that the structure deserves some thoughtful studying. Rumour, I presume, is greatly exaggerating its capabilities.]]></string>

<string id="528255"><![CDATA[If you really did spread the disease, I'll ask for you to be taken to the Thanatica for experimentation. Perhaps I'll have better luck getting you out of this miracle-abounding hellhole than I did with Simon.]]></string>

<string id="528261"><![CDATA[Weren't you trying to get to the Inquisitor just now? I suppose that didn't turn out well in the slightest. You weren't even allowed to present yourself to her gracious ladyship. Be thankful there's no armed guard around the Cathedral right now.

<string id="528265"><![CDATA[No door will stop me. No hand will hold me back. See? Now you can convince yourself.]]></string>
<string id="528266"><![CDATA[How did you recognize me?]]></string>
<string id="528267"><![CDATA[It's simple! No other Executor could approach the Cathedral from that direction at this time. You are the Changeling. But don't you fret, I won't turn you in.]]></string>

<string id="528274"><![CDATA[A little…]]></string>
<string id="528275"><![CDATA[Well... that is entirely lawful. What does the Inquisitor want from me?]]></string>
<string id="528276"><![CDATA[She's ordered me to question you the way I used to question others upon your orders. I'll ask you my way... and you will give answers.]]></string>
<string id="528277"><![CDATA[What is it?]]></string>
<string id="528278"><![CDATA[I believe the town has been doomed from the outset. And if I'm right, there is at least a degree to which our actions could be justified. So here goes: I anticipate that some very powerful people share my views. Find out one last thing for me: by whom, and with what instructions, were the three envoys sent here. The Bachelor, the Inquisitor, and the Commander.]]></string>
<string id="528279"><![CDATA[The... Commander?]]></string>
<string id="528280"><![CDATA[Didn't you know? The army is on its way here. They will arrive in a few days. I presume that their commanding officer is under orders to assess whether a total annihilation of our town is in order.]]></string>
<string id="528281"><![CDATA[So the army will level the town?]]></string>
<string id="528282"><![CDATA[It is clear at this point that all three emissaries are destroyers. Not one of them is even considering the option of preservation and future creative development. Find out, then, what orders these destroyers have been given. I am interested in knowing who instructed these destroyers, and with what rationale.]]></string>
<string id="528283"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="528284"><![CDATA[Why do you need to know that?]]></string>
<string id="528285"><![CDATA[Don't you understand? I can die with a clear conscience if I know that those pulling the strings also believed the town to be doomed. Otherwise, I'll go mad. Find that out for me, my child! Then I'll tell you everything, and make you my heiress even as you condemn me to death.]]></string>
<string id="528286"><![CDATA[I don't need to be retold what others had to say. I'd like to hear it in your own words. Well?]]></string>
<string id="528287"><![CDATA[The town is doomed, father. It's been doomed since the very beginning.]]></string>
<string id="528288"><![CDATA[The very beginning? This town is several hundred years old. And if we include the Kin settlement, it might date all the way back to the creation of the world.]]></string>

<string id="528296"><![CDATA[Tell me about her.]]></string>
<string id="528297"><![CDATA[She was brought here by a kidnapper eleven years ago when she was but a little child. She's been indulging in every sin possible ever since—passionately, voluptuosly even. It's more than anyone can bear—and so it's time for her to go!]]></string>
<string id="528298"><![CDATA[You go easy on Aspity!]]></string>
<string id="528299"><![CDATA[Sorry. Didn't think you two had something in common.]]></string>

<string id="528302"><![CDATA[No! Of course not! I didn't want to. You asked me why I am so sad, so I gave the answer, that's all.]]></string>

<string id="528307"><![CDATA[Speak.]]></string>
<string id="528308"><![CDATA[You will be loved. You will shed rivers of blood. You will think hard as to what sacrifice to make. You will inevitably make the wrong choice.

<string id="528309"><![CDATA[You're right, I'd rather not.]]></string>
<string id="528310"><![CDATA[I wanted to introduce myself. Looks like it's unnecessary.]]></string>
<string id="528311"><![CDATA[Explain yourself? Your very self? How curious! Speak. I've found myself rather preoccupied with matters of identity lately! Seems like I've abandoned those matters all too early—seeing what they have done to me.]]></string>
<string id="528312"><![CDATA[Our conversation is taking a strange turn...]]></string>
<string id="528313"><![CDATA[No it isn't. Your father had invited you to his own funeral. And so you arrived—only to find him murdered. You then came into an inheritance, saddled with an obligation to save a creature that you know nothing about by making a panacea; it also warned you of a sacrifice it will inevitably require. Is that correct?]]></string>
<string id="528314"><![CDATA[It is.]]></string>
<string id="528315"><![CDATA[So, they've made you invent a panacea? An unexpected move...]]></string>
<string id="528316"><![CDATA[Made me? It was my choice.]]></string>
<string id="528317"><![CDATA[You were masterfully led to this conclusion by the circumstances. You consider the creation of a panacea your principal goal—and do you really believe it was your idea all along?]]></string>
<string id="528318"><![CDATA[So what am I guilty of?]]></string>
<string id="528319"><![CDATA[Oh please, no one is blaming anyone here! Who in the world would call you guilty... the Powers That Be tricked you. You were set up. Who led you onto this path? Who was this malicious influence? You are but a pawn in their clumsy hands. A tool for someone else's execution.]]></string>
<string id="528320"><![CDATA[I do as I see fit. I choose my own path. If someone wants to use my choices for their scheming, so be it.]]></string>
<string id="528321"><![CDATA[…That's some nerve. Or am I missing something…? Listen to me, you silly man, you've been played! Manipulated! My position comes with perks—facts, access to information. Don't you believe me? Do you need proof?]]></string>

<string id="528362"><![CDATA[What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="528363"><![CDATA[I've had a disagreement with the Rat Prophet! And so he's hiding from me now, telling me nothing...

<string id="528364"><![CDATA[You said yourself that he was a liar. Why do you need him?]]></string>
<string id="528365"><![CDATA[Oh, I need someone! Anyone! Oh, Burakh! I have helped you, haven't I? You've made another step towards making your panacea, haven't you? Could you help me out too? Do me a favour in return?]]></string>
<string id="528366"><![CDATA[What do you want?]]></string>
<string id="528367"><![CDATA[Let's outsmart him! Go see him as though on your own, he won't say no to you. Pretend to hate me and ask him about my fortune! What happens to me tomorrow? But most importantly—who am I…? Why have I come to this world…? Got that? Will you help me?]]></string>
<string id="528368"><![CDATA[He lives under the Theatre—or even inside it. Burakh, Haruspex, sir, please, please be kind, please get to him! Oh, if only you knew how I suffer… I'm lonely and in pain…]]></string>

<string id="528374"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>

<string id="528380"><![CDATA[I've heard an enraged mob was planning to desecrate the Mistresses' tombs. And, well… you see, I disobeyed doctor Dankovsky's orders recently and went outside to speak to my mother. Her tomb is the one that's closer to the cape, you must have seen it.]]></string>
<string id="528381"><![CDATA[I don't get it...]]></string>
<string id="528382"><![CDATA[I brought a gift for my mother then. A diary. A compilation of sentimental memoirs, nothing more, but it's dear to me. When I was a little girl, my mother used to leave me secret notes in it; the letters were seemingly appearing out of nowhere. I believed that the book was talking to me.]]></string>
<string id="528383"><![CDATA[You need this book?]]></string>
<string id="528384"><![CDATA[Bring me the diary, Burakh! I fear... I fear that the tomb will end up desecrated. I wouldn't want the diary to be damaged... or fall into the wrong hands.]]></string>
<string id="528386"><![CDATA[Why did you take it to the grave?]]></string>
<string id="528387"><![CDATA[Oh, that look in your eyes, Burakh! Yes, you are quite shrewd—and your assumption is correct. Do not be disturbed though. We, the Kains, have our own way of communicating with our dear departed. In fact, their relationship with the world of the living is much more intimate than is commonly believed.]]></string>
<string id="528388"><![CDATA[So...]]></string>
<string id="528389"><![CDATA[...That diary could of more value to me than a simple memento. Will you bring it?]]></string>

<string id="528391"><![CDATA[For a price.]]></string>
<string id="528392"><![CDATA[Oh... It was quite unexpected of you to flaunt the price tag. I thought our relationshp was developing so chivalrously… I will reward you, of course. Let us pretend you've never asked for it. It's more fun that way.]]></string>
<string id="528393"><![CDATA[Don't try playing games with me.]]></string>
<string id="528394"><![CDATA[No. I don't want to.]]></string>

<string id="528396"><![CDATA[I'm happy to hear you admit that.]]></string>
<string id="528397"><![CDATA[I apologize wholeheartedly. I would much rather prefer peace. I've heard that you've done so many worthy deeds that even the feats of ancient warriors pale in comparison. Are you truly so heroic?]]></string>

<string id="528432"><![CDATA[No, I don't believe you...]]></string>
<string id="528433"><![CDATA[But—heads up!—she doesn't know it. And so she performs miracles, branding herself a miracle-maker—because she believes that she is one.

<string id="528443"><![CDATA[Apology accepted.]]></string>
<string id="528444"><![CDATA[It wasn't. By the time the locomotive that had brought you here arrived at the Station, we hadn't given out any orders yet. Few people even knew of the ruler's death. We thought that this ambush was carried out by random enthusiasts.]]></string>

<string id="528458"><![CDATA[The fact that my daughter is growing to resemble her by the day. It means that this town will soon have a powerful Mistress who will use her primordial, ancient power that comes from the very depths of the earth to stop this cursed pestilence and revive our town for the glory to come.]]></string>
<string id="528459"><![CDATA[You have a poetic mind.]]></string>
<string id="528460"><![CDATA[Yes. I've been luckier than you.]]></string>
<string id="528461"><![CDATA[But I'm more likely to survive.]]></string>

<string id="528466"><![CDATA[Are you sure?]]></string>
<string id="528467"><![CDATA[The government Inquisitor will conduct a swift investigation, find the culprits and make a public example of them. Rightly so, if you ask me, sir!]]></string>
<string id="528468"><![CDATA[Which culprits? Hundreds of crimes have been committed here recently.]]></string>
<string id="528469"><![CDATA[I mean this jail, sir. There's been a mass imprisonment of innocent townsfolk. Senseless violence; unlawful methods. Criminal negligence that led to the contamination of a cell and numerous deaths. The culprit must be punished.]]></string>
<string id="528470"><![CDATA[And here I thought it's you and the likes of you that are actually guilty of… unlawful violence.]]></string>
<string id="528471"><![CDATA[Not by choice, sir. We were acting under direct orders, sir. We were not ordered to think, sir.]]></string>
<string id="528472"><![CDATA[Now Law shall prevail, sir.]]></string>
<string id="528473"><![CDATA[You are one philosopher, mate. Where's the Inquisitor?]]></string>
<string id="528474"><![CDATA[I ain't no mate of yours! And stop with the snarling! You ain't my boss! You cooked your own goose—and now you're making fun of an honest patrolperson?]]></string>
<string id="528475"><![CDATA[Calm down, will you? Where's the Inquisitor?]]></string>
<string id="528476"><![CDATA[Her Excellency has left for that leech of a usurer's hideout to interrogate him. The one that was at the root of all that arson mess. Well, they'll fashion themselves with hempen cravats now. Arson is bad, mate!]]></string>
<string id="528477"><![CDATA[Is the Inquisitor in?]]></string>
<string id="528478"><![CDATA[On business, mate.]]></string>
<string id="528479"><![CDATA[Talk to the head Executor. Ours is a modest role.]]></string>
<string id="528480"><![CDATA[Why are you here?]]></string>
<string id="528481"><![CDATA[The volunteer patrol guard forces have been transferred under the command of the government emissary. We're guarding the place and executing the Inquisitor's orders. So please kindly comply.]]></string>
<string id="528482"><![CDATA[I need to see the Inquisitor.]]></string>
<string id="528483"><![CDATA[We were late. We came when it was all over. She dealt with the attack, ordered to seize the Hunchback, and went away.]]></string>
<string id="528484"><![CDATA[You wanted to kill her?]]></string>
<string id="528485"><![CDATA[No, of course not! Killing an Inquisitor…? Hah! What for, anyway? We're not killers. We wanted to expose her true intentions! A plan exposed is less than half a plan.]]></string>
<string id="528486"><![CDATA[I wish you luck.]]></string>
<string id="528487"><![CDATA[Uh huh, I see...]]></string>
<string id="528488"><![CDATA[You are one naïve young man.]]></string>
<string id="528489"><![CDATA[You students…]]></string>
<string id="528490"><![CDATA[How is it strange?]]></string>
<string id="528491"><![CDATA[Well, for one thing, Aglaya Lilich is my late wife's sister. We could think ourselves lucky—were it not for an old mutual grudge between the sisters that persisted despite the difference in age. It's a terrible, hopeless feud that even the elder sister's death has done nothing to assuage.]]></string>
<string id="528492"><![CDATA[It is a coincidence.]]></string>
<string id="528493"><![CDATA[I fear that too many personal interests will get in the way of Aglaya's duty here. None of these personal interests… being remotely favourable for us. I think Aglaya Lilich regards this expedition as a mere pretext for revenge.]]></string>
<string id="528494"><![CDATA[Since when are Inquisitors allowed to have feelings?]]></string>
<string id="528495"><![CDATA[Some are. You see, it's only getting stranger from here. I've been informed of another strange detail by a person from the Capital who I trust. According to him, the High Tribunal of the Inquisitors' Collegium has sentenced Aglaya Lilich to death.]]></string>
<string id="528496"><![CDATA[What?]]></string>
<string id="528497"><![CDATA[There are three possibilities here. One: my information is incorrect. Two: she has come here of her own accord, having disposed of the real Inquisitor and usurped their authority. If anything, she has nothing to lose anymore… But that's too hard to believe.]]></string>
<string id="528498"><![CDATA[Well, what about the third possibility?]]></string>
<string id="528499"><![CDATA[The third, and most likely, possibility is that the Powers That Be have granted Aglaya Lilich a last chance to redeem herself—by giving her an all but hopeless mission. It makes sense; her chances of survival here are quite low to begin with. This version seems to be the best one for us... and the worst one for you.]]></string>
<string id="528500"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="528501"><![CDATA[Because the last thing she needs is competition, my friend. An Inquisitor's job is to find a bold solution to an impossible problem—a solution so smart, so outside-the-box, that its very outlandishness (provided, of course, that it proves efficient) would more than justify their acting with impunity. That's why they are needed in the first place. You've robbed Aglaya of the chance to prove her worth... and I'm afraid she is already aware of that.]]></string>
<string id="528504"><![CDATA[I'm no competitor to her.]]></string>
<string id="528505"><![CDATA[What about your panacea? The Bachelor has told me there's only one tiny step left for you to make. If that is not the solution to the problem, what is? Were it not for these unfortunate tribulations poor doctor Rubin had to go through because of us, you would have created it already, wouldn't you?]]></string>
<string id="528506"><![CDATA[No. I wouldn't have.]]></string>
<string id="528507"><![CDATA[Well... Then you can stand before the Inquisitor with a clear conscience. You won't be able to avoid it anyway—unless you're considering fleeing the town, of course.]]></string>
<string id="528508"><![CDATA[I'm considering nothing of the sort.]]></string>
<string id="528509"><![CDATA[She is probably already at the Cathedral. All I can do is wish you luck. Fortune has been kind to you of late—perhaps it will continue to shower you with its abundant gifts. If you go to the Cathedral, I'd say the odds of your survival and non-detainment are three to seven.]]></string>
<string id="528510"><![CDATA[Is it true that the Inquisitor is planning to have me killed for my invention?]]></string>
<string id="528511"><![CDATA[Upon whom?]]></string>
<string id="528512"><![CDATA[Upon my late wife and her elder sister... Or rather what's left of her.]]></string>
<string id="528513"><![CDATA[Who would allow an Inquisitor to use their mission for setting personal scores?]]></string>
<string id="528514"><![CDATA[Not a "who". A "what". Despair. I have recently come to know that Aglaya Lilich has been sentenced to death… for her affinity to schemes and hidden agendas, dare I add. Only a miracle can save her from the scaffold. It's easy to get carried away in a situation like this. One may as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb.]]></string>
<string id="528515"><![CDATA[How could anyone have assigned a mission like this to her then?]]></string>
<string id="528517"><![CDATA[I fear no one.]]></string>
<string id="528518"><![CDATA[Is she still here?]]></string>
<string id="528519"><![CDATA[No. She went to the town jail. And she was sooo angry! She's ordered to unlock the Termitary! Said there was no one there to escape anyway…]]></string>
<string id="528520"><![CDATA[What else did she say?]]></string>
<string id="528521"><![CDATA[Said she'll punish those who are responsible for this big time. It won't be easy to find out who's to blame, I told her. She'll crack the puzzle though, I think.]]></string>
<string id="528522"><![CDATA[I thought everyone knew who issued the order to lock the Termitary up.]]></string>
<string id="528523"><![CDATA[Well, I don't. But the guest said she would find out. Ugh, she's so menacing! All I wanted was to shrink into a very very tiny little thingie—that's how scared I was… And I'm not one to get scared easily!]]></string>
<string id="528524"><![CDATA[How will it make them come to harm?]]></string>
<string id="528528"><![CDATA[A sacrifice was made yesterday—and who do you think they used? A Supreme, a Bos Primigenius went to the slab! Everything was supposed to change… yet nothing has. It means the Warden is a false one!]]></string>
<string id="528529"><![CDATA[What Warden?]]></string>
<string id="528530"><![CDATA[Foreman Oyun. It was he that opened the Supreme up. But nothing happened! The plague didn't stop! Perhaps he's simply a bad Warden? Otherwise the lines would've extended. The sacred blood of the Supreme would have cured the world. But no such luck!]]></string>
<string id="528531"><![CDATA[So the Foreman is back?]]></string>
<string id="528532"><![CDATA[Since last night. That's when the Supreme was brought in from the Steppe—right through the Gorge. He was sooo huge! I've seen a Supreme's shadow for the first time in my life! And my odonghs keep saying it will be the last, too…]]></string>
<string id="528533"><![CDATA[You wouldn't happen to know as to how I could get to the Foreman, would you, Mother Superior?]]></string>
<string id="528534"><![CDATA[Tell me, Mother, do you know what the "udurgh" brand means?]]></string>
<string id="528535"><![CDATA[Kind of. I've seen this mark. It means something really really big. Like a mountain, maybe?]]></string>
<string id="528536"><![CDATA[No, it's not a mountain.]]></string>
<string id="528537"><![CDATA[Maybe it's the earth?]]></string>
<string id="528538"><![CDATA[Hardly.]]></string>
<string id="528539"><![CDATA[Weird... Maybe it's the people?]]></string>
<string id="528540"><![CDATA[Do you know, or are you just guessing?]]></string>
<string id="528541"><![CDATA[I don't know the letters all that well. I haven't been taught yet. But I know that it's something either very very big, or very very important! See that angle?]]></string>
<string id="528542"><![CDATA[Is it alive?]]></string>
<string id="528543"><![CDATA[Probably. See the horns?]]></string>
<string id="528544"><![CDATA[Can anyone tell me more about this brand?]]></string>
<string id="528545"><![CDATA[Only a Warden can. Too bad that we don't have any menkhus left, they're all dead. And the odonghe that know it have all gone off into the Steppe. They're preparing for a very important festival.]]></string>
<string id="528546"><![CDATA[Too bad indeed…]]></string>
<string id="528548"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="528549"><![CDATA[So what do we do?]]></string>
<string id="528550"><![CDATA[The Worms opened a bull up yesterday too, you know! And they claim their sacrifice has made a difference! Is that possible? It's just idle talk, I think… and it'll do them more harm than good. Perhaps you could find out what they've done? They're on the upper floor of the Short Block, hiding from the wrath of the Kin.]]></string>
<string id="528551"><![CDATA[To fulfil what was preordained. It is not forbidden. Even children are allowed to do clay-moulding. Fill Bos Turokh's belly with Suok's gruel, and evil will go.]]></string>

<string id="528553"><![CDATA[We've summoned a colossal envoy from beyond. It's unlike us. It's not human.]]></string>

<string id="528562"><![CDATA[We would not dare, oynon. What for? We do not know how. We were doing a good deed.]]></string>
<string id="528564"><![CDATA[That's interesting... Go on!]]></string>
<string id="528565"><![CDATA[Tell me.]]></string>
<string id="528566"><![CDATA[You are to call me Elder One. You have been brought up away from the Vein of Boddho, yet you have decided to come back. You are nothing here until the Kin takes you in. Obey the customs. Obey the Rite. Obey the line of succession. Obey.]]></string>
<string id="528567"><![CDATA[Who killed my father, Elder One?]]></string>
<string id="528568"><![CDATA[Silence! Who gave you the right to ask me questions without my permission?]]></string>
<string id="528569"><![CDATA[...The one who sent me here, Elder One. I do it in their name.]]></string>
<string id="528570"><![CDATA[Then ask.]]></string>
<string id="528571"><![CDATA[Tell me what an aurochs is.]]></string>
<string id="528572"><![CDATA["Aurochs" is the name given to a Kindred Bull by merchants of old. We call him Bos Primigenius to honour the knowledgeable one that had shown him to us.]]></string>
<string id="528573"><![CDATA[You are Oyun, a menkhu and the Foreman of the Abattoir.]]></string>
<string id="528574"><![CDATA[What does the "Udurgh" brand mean, Elder One?]]></string>
<string id="528575"><![CDATA[I have no intention of obeying you!]]></string>
<string id="528576"><![CDATA[You have chosen your fortune. Get out.]]></string>
<string id="528577"><![CDATA[My free will means more to me.]]></string>
<string id="528578"><![CDATA[I know of that name.]]></string>
<string id="528579"><![CDATA[He is Mother Boddho's flesh and blood, his form congruent to the Universe!  His lines are the lines of the world. There is nothing in the world that is not contained within the body of a Supreme. His white flesh tells the march of time; his blue flesh rules waters and rains; his brown flesh keeps the heat in.]]></string>
<string id="528580"><![CDATA[So you've opened up a Supreme not so long ago, haven't you?]]></string>
<string id="528581"><![CDATA[I have, as was my right. Who else but I, a Warden, the Foreman of the Abattoir, is to open a Supreme's lines up?]]></string>
<string id="528582"><![CDATA[Give me a gulp of his blood.]]></string>
<string id="528583"><![CDATA[You are impudent, son of Boddho. Aren't you pushing it?]]></string>
<string id="528584"><![CDATA[That is a foreign name from a dead language.]]></string>
<string id="528585"><![CDATA[I am aware of that.]]></string>
<string id="528586"><![CDATA["Aware"? What are you aware of? Are you aware that his ribs are mountain ridges? That his skull is the firmament? His juices are rivers. His hair is herbs and grass and roots. His voice is the song of Boddho, his seed the joy of Boddho's Vein, his black blood the time and memory of our Earth. Are you aware of that?]]></string>
<string id="528587"><![CDATA[…You're faltering already. Even I'm aware of that.]]></string>
<string id="528588"><![CDATA[Who directed your steps?]]></string>

<string id="528590"><![CDATA[The lines of my fortune direct my steps, Elder One.]]></string>
<string id="528591"><![CDATA[I act in the name of the one who sent me. You know what Emissary came to the town last night.]]></string>
<string id="528592"><![CDATA[I know that all too well. Let it be so then. I will give you as much blood as you can carry away in your cupped palm. This is the price I am willing to pay to buy us peace and get rid of the emissary. I know neither of you nor of your name, and so you will get not a single drop more. Give me your hand!]]></string>
<string id="528593"><![CDATA[How much blood do you have left?]]></string>
<string id="528594"><![CDATA[You have asked too many questions, Kindred One. Be on your way.]]></string>
<string id="528595"><![CDATA[Yet you haven't answered.]]></string>
<string id="528598"><![CDATA[What reason does the Inquisitor have to take your life?]]></string>
<string id="528599"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor has no power over me... although... they do have power over everyone. They need not concern themselves with legal details. If they need to kill, you die. If they need you to go, you go. They know the ways. But that's not what I'm talking about.]]></string>
<string id="528600"><![CDATA[So what is it that stands between you and your victory?]]></string>
<string id="528601"><![CDATA[I've failed to find the source of the disease. And yet it keeps coming… from somewhere. There is a will behind this. But I've failed to find the carrier; moreover, it doesn't feel like that's a matter of time. It's like the carrier isn't human at all…]]></string>
<string id="528602"><![CDATA[Funny. I keep coming back to the same problem…]]></string>
<string id="528603"><![CDATA[And so I won't be able to make a panacea. You said that we could try artificial synthesis, didn't you?]]></string>
<string id="528604"><![CDATA[No, it's useless... and impossible without Rubin anyway.]]></string>
<string id="528605"><![CDATA[Perhaps there is another way for me to fulfil my duty. If only I knew whom my father had marked with the damn sign!]]></string>
<string id="528606"><![CDATA[Oh... Have you given in to despair? Whoever this mysterious patient is, there's only one thing that can save him—the panacea. If it's not too late, I mean. So many have died…]]></string>
<string id="528607"><![CDATA[What are you talking about then?]]></string>
<string id="528608"><![CDATA[I've made up my mind. If I am not to go back victorious, then I'd rather blow my brains out with this very revolver. I'm cornered. I'll never be able to look the people I've failed to protect in the eye. My allies will end up in prison or exile, my research… in fire.]]></string>
<string id="528609"><![CDATA[That was not the chimera I had in mind.]]></string>
<string id="528610"><![CDATA[What's happened to Stakh?]]></string>
<string id="528611"><![CDATA[He turned himself in to the Kains yesterday. I don't know whether he was counting on Victor's compassion or Georgiy's common sense, but—against all expectations—Maria was on the throne at the time. I don't know any further details… What I do know is that no one's seen Stakh since.]]></string>
<string id="528612"><![CDATA[Which one then?]]></string>
<string id="528613"><![CDATA[If only I knew whom my father had marked with the cursed sign! I need to go to the Abattoir right now. To talk to the Foreman.]]></string>
<string id="528614"><![CDATA[I need to go to the Abattoir now. To see the Foreman.]]></string>
<string id="528615"><![CDATA[The Abattoir is off limits. You won't get in there unless the Inquisitor lets you. It's the Inquisitor who is now in charge of fighting the epidemic… and everything else.]]></string>
<string id="528616"><![CDATA[I can do just fine without it...]]></string>
<string id="528617"><![CDATA[You're going to need their clearance for movement anyway. I advise you receive it sooner rather than later. If your ill fame precedes you… well, it would be better if you came on your own volition. Outrun ugly rumours and let them know that you're dissecting bodies for a reason.]]></string>
<string id="528618"><![CDATA[And so the only thing left for me is to fulfil my father's duty. But who was it that he vowed to save even if it cost him his family's honour? I don't know…]]></string>
<string id="528619"><![CDATA[Well, I need a hybrid of man and bull. A chimera...]]></string>
<string id="528620"><![CDATA[Will you come too?]]></string>
<string id="528621"><![CDATA[I will go there. Not with you though. Go, I need some time to collect my thoughts. And, Burakh… I'm glad we haven't had time to become enemies. Good luck.]]></string>
<string id="528622"><![CDATA[Good luck to you too, oynon.]]></string>
<string id="528623"><![CDATA[The envoys have turned into destroyers against the will of those that sent them here. The Powers That Be only want one thing, and that's to preserve the town at any cost.]]></string>
<string id="528624"><![CDATA[Have I answered your question, father?]]></string>
<string id="528625"><![CDATA[...Which means that I am beyond forgiveness.]]></string>
<string id="528626"><![CDATA[Have I fulfilled your task, father?]]></string>
<string id="528627"><![CDATA[Yes. Spare me your formulas. I will answer your questions candidly and without prejudice. Everything is seemingly self-evident anyway. War crimes and crimes against the state are the only kinds of crime that warrant the death penalty without the need to worry about a possible judicial error.]]></string>
<string id="528628"><![CDATA[Why do you blame yourself for what's happened here?]]></string>
<string id="528629"><![CDATA[If anyone is to blame for it all turning out this way, it's me. The ruler is always responsible for the suffering of the populace. I bear no blame for the outbreak of the epidemic—but the blame for the devastation it has wrought upon our town is mine and mine alone.]]></string>
<string id="528630"><![CDATA[True. You are beyond forgiveness.]]></string>
<string id="528631"><![CDATA[A force like that is impossible to oppose.]]></string>
<string id="528632"><![CDATA[You may convict me now and hand me over to the Inquisitor. Katerina and I took council last night. We had foreseen this outcome. Yet my wife believes that you'll gain much more if you keep us alive for now. You will soon need people who are prepared to die.]]></string>
<string id="528633"><![CDATA[Wh—what?!]]></string>
<string id="528634"><![CDATA[Have you talked to Katerina yet? Talk to her. She still bears you no ill-will. And now her goodwill is no longer mudded with considerations of either power or duty.

<string id="528654"><![CDATA[How tragic!]]></string>
<string id="528655"><![CDATA[Yes. I promised to compensate the gatherer for his loss, as I feel I had been partly to blame.

<string id="528657"><![CDATA[Indeed? Why not?]]></string>
<string id="528658"><![CDATA[This town is a most unfortunate synthesis of irreconcilable opposites. They're gnawing at each other, coupled forcibly by an extraneous will like two of the same pole of a magnet. Spirit can't be contained by everyday-life matter. The town may have nurtured a miracle into existence, but it must be released now. And here, as you can see... Aglaya is right!]]></string>
<string id="528659"><![CDATA[And what are her instructions?]]></string>
<string id="528660"><![CDATA[I don't know. But I can give you a tip. She's been surprisingly forthright with the Haruspex. Ask him; perhaps he'll share her confessions with you. I don't suppose the feelings have been mutual.]]></string>
<string id="528661"><![CDATA[So now we're talking feelings? Interesting! How did that happen?]]></string>
<string id="528662"><![CDATA[It was during the interrogation. She declared that he was no more than a pawn and an instrument of her retribution. But Burakh's manner was so dignified that she was touched. He impressed her so much with his adamancy that nothing came of the interrogation in the end. The roles were almost reversed.]]></string>

<string id="528667"><![CDATA[Ah! I see. What did he say? It doesn't work out?]]></string>
<string id="528668"><![CDATA[He asked me to give you these vials.]]></string>
<string id="528669"><![CDATA[That's exactly what he said. "It doesn't work out..." In short, he's betrayed you.]]></string>

<string id="528678"><![CDATA[Does it sound crazy to you? Why on earth? It shouldn't. After the raid, he had promised to get their father out of jail. But I suppose he then had more important business to attend to. The man died in custody along with dozens of other innocents.]]></string>
<string id="528679"><![CDATA[And how are you planning to help them?]]></string>
<string id="528680"><![CDATA[Give them these five vials, will you? They're an extract of... well, you don't need to know. You see, I can't leave this place. I think I now have a chance to create my panacea before the day ends…]]></string>

<string id="528689"><![CDATA[I'm only interested in one thing. Those who sent her, what do they want?]]></string>
<string id="528690"><![CDATA[Ah... Well, there's an underhanded game going on there. The Powers That Be are playing everyone at once. Killing several birds with one stone. For every single thing that misfires, they have a backup plan. They turn every failure to their advantage. This woman is one of those stones. It doesn't matter what the stone hits. Those are just her suspicions, though. I might even say her epiphanies...]]></string>
<string id="528691"><![CDATA[So Aglaya Lilich was a stone they threw right at the town?]]></string>
<string id="528692"><![CDATA[The Powers gave her hypocritical orders. They need this town with all the warts that have grown upon it. They're interested precisely in this living mutant. But to preserve all of it is a task as amoral as is it is impossible. Which is why they're disguising this objective as something else. In short, they utter one command and imply another.]]></string>
<string id="528693"><![CDATA[And why is preserving the town amoral and impossible?]]></string>
<string id="528694"><![CDATA[Not the town. The town proper ought to be saved all right. But in their parlance, "the town" means this entire order of things. This pump that sucks half-humans out of the ground, who then feed children to that horrible tower over there. The envoy thinks this system is doomed. Hence the ongoing disaster.]]></string>
<string id="528695"><![CDATA[And what about the Commander? Did she talk about him?]]></string>
<string id="528696"><![CDATA[What Commander? Commander who?]]></string>

<string id="528707"><![CDATA[An unnatural town? And yet it embodies the entirety of the logic of human Existence!

<string id="528708"><![CDATA[Oh... So you have your doubts?]]></string>
<string id="528709"><![CDATA[Have you talked to the Inquisitor? I've heard she cleared you of all charges…]]></string>
<string id="528710"><![CDATA[Yes. For some reason, it didn't take her long to stop doubting my innocence.]]></string>
<string id="528711"><![CDATA[No. She said time would show whether my persecution had been justified.]]></string>
<string id="528712"><![CDATA[Well... The tide has turned. The Saburovs have been stripped of power. When one falls from a great height, one cannot but fall to one's death... We have been given very little time to... transfer our power. Both the Power of the Sword and the Power of the Spirit.]]></string>

<string id="528716"><![CDATA[But who was the Saburov Mistress before you?]]></string>
<string id="528717"><![CDATA[There was one... Don't ask for her name. Go now! Don't you dare hesitate... This is an issue I cannot resolve on my own. Fear nothing.]]></string>
<string id="528718"><![CDATA[What are they saying?]]></string>
<string id="528719"><![CDATA[They said they'd recognize my power—but not my sister's.]]></string>

<string id="528722"><![CDATA[There is nothing to tell. Everything is clear. I never had the power. I am not a true Mistress. I lied... but not for gain.

<string id="528724"><![CDATA[Well then. It's your fault!]]></string>
<string id="528725"><![CDATA[What can I say…]]></string>
<string id="528726"><![CDATA[I'll tell you just one thing... trust me on it if you can trust me at all anymore. Leave me and my husband alive for a while; we won't last long anyway. We'll be useful to you in the end.]]></string>

<string id="528734"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="528735"><![CDATA[Is she? That has long been overdue. An event like this means the Inquisitor's arrival was worth the wait indeed... In whose favour?]]></string>
<string id="528736"><![CDATA[Certainly not yours, Maria!]]></string>
<string id="528737"><![CDATA[God... do you really think I would claim the mantle of the Mistress of the Humble? That's a role better suited for you.]]></string>

<string id="528739"><![CDATA[You're a funny girl... He doesn't exactly appear before me in the mirror, you know! It's only in scary tales that spirits talk in hollow voices from under the ground.

<string id="528740"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="528741"><![CDATA[Just like that... You see, it's strange that Simon is still alive. Diffused, as it were, within the town itself. We can feel his presence. He claims it's you who are making this possible.]]></string>

<string id="528743"><![CDATA[We're all busy thinking now how to reassemble his spirit, particle by particle, and saturate it with life. Then he'll say more. Off you go, girl—we won't hurt you anymore, what with Aglaya's orders too…]]></string>

<string id="528750"><![CDATA[She is.]]></string>
<string id="528751"><![CDATA[At any rate, nothing is going to happen while Katerina is alive. It's not a throne. One cannot sign away the spirit to someone else... But it probably won't be long...

<string id="528838"><![CDATA[On day five, Rubin said that Simon's unique, most singular blood had all been spent—to the last drop. Gone into the vaccine. Then yesterday, the Haruspex made a serum out of blood that was structurally similar to Simon's, even surpassing it.]]></string>
<string id="528839"><![CDATA[…And whose blood was it?]]></string>
<string id="528840"><![CDATA[Only he knows that. But that's not the mystery. On days six and seven, the Haruspex brought me blood that was similar to Simon's. Where was he getting it from?]]></string>
<string id="528841"><![CDATA[Capella has asked me to bring you your old book of fairytales.]]></string>
<string id="528842"><![CDATA[Let me see. No, that's not our book of fairytales... This one has some that weren't included in the Tale of the Sons, and not even in the Ughun. My sister had them copied by hand... Apparently these things have never been written down before. Thank you. Just a little while ago a present like this would've made me very happy.]]></string>
<string id="528843"><![CDATA[And now?]]></string>
<string id="528844"><![CDATA[And now it's reminding me that there's probably no use trying to get to the bottom of things that people aren't meant to know. I'm even wondering if I haven't incurred the earth's wrath by inflicting such a wound on it... I guess I'll surrender to the Worms at the Termitary. That's the thing to do.]]></string>
<string id="528845"><![CDATA[What for?]]></string>
<string id="528846"><![CDATA[It will be a symbolic death. Tomorrow the Inquisitor will re-open the Termitary and find out who and when gave the order to board it up. No, I've made up my mind! I won't wait until I'm dragged out by the ear; I'm going to surrender voluntarily to those I subjected to such tortures and executions.]]></string>
<string id="528847"><![CDATA[I'm not afraid of you either.]]></string>
<string id="528848"><![CDATA[But that's not true!]]></string>
<string id="528849"><![CDATA[Whether it's true doesn't matter at this point. Have you heard the news? Mark Karminsky, a governmental Inquisitor, arrives here tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="528850"><![CDATA[No…]]></string>
<string id="528851"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="528852"><![CDATA[No, it was you!]]></string>
<string id="528853"><![CDATA[That's exactly why I need him!]]></string>
<string id="528854"><![CDATA[He'll kill you…]]></string>
<string id="528855"><![CDATA[We'll see about that!]]></string>
<string id="528856"><![CDATA[He'll kill me if he finds me against my will.]]></string>
<string id="528857"><![CDATA[He's gone to the runaway butchers' den, to—whatserface, that sort-of-human—ah yes, Aspity! Her belongings were found in the Cathedral.]]></string>
<string id="528858"><![CDATA[And you, Lara? Have you been cleared?]]></string>
<string id="528859"><![CDATA[I don't know yet... But I did agree to be tested. I gave him my blood.]]></string>
<string id="528860"><![CDATA[Where is the Bachelor?]]></string>
<string id="528861"><![CDATA[Don't make me angry... or I'll bite!]]></string>
<string id="528862"><![CDATA[I wasn't trying to in the first place. Where did he go? ]]></string>
<string id="528863"><![CDATA[He's gone to the Shelter to see Lara Ravel. I wonder how exactly the semi-half-witted Lara wound up on the suspect list…]]></string>
<string id="528864"><![CDATA[It was!]]></string>
<string id="528865"><![CDATA[Don't you know? A woman sneaked mysteriously into the Cathedral at dawn, passing through walls and doors. She kissed the lips of everyone who was sheltered there, and gave them gifts. They all died. And the things they were clutching in their hands—those were Yulia's belongings.]]></string>
<string id="528866"><![CDATA[Ah, so that's what happened! I've been suspecting her for a long time.]]></string>
<string id="528867"><![CDATA[But it wasn't Yulia, was it?]]></string>
<string id="528868"><![CDATA[Oh, how I'd like to have a frank conversation with her…]]></string>
<string id="528869"><![CDATA[Then seize the moment. She'll spill the beans now.]]></string>
<string id="528870"><![CDATA[I could swear on something holy…]]></string>
<string id="528871"><![CDATA[What measure is a while?]]></string>
<string id="528872"><![CDATA[Tell me about your brother.]]></string>
<string id="528873"><![CDATA[So you're not close?]]></string>
<string id="528874"><![CDATA[All he ever thinks of is money. Well, money and Steppe lore. He's crazy about it... But even that doesn't make him a good conversationalist.]]></string>
<string id="528875"><![CDATA[Steppe lore?]]></string>
<string id="528876"><![CDATA[Yes. The legends and myths. The rites and traditions. By the way, he asked for a book of fairytales; my kids have copied one for him. But you are a Steppe lore character yourself, it would seem?]]></string>
<string id="528877"><![CDATA[Not as fortunate as you think.]]></string>
<string id="528878"><![CDATA[I don't know… What does it suggest?]]></string>
<string id="528879"><![CDATA[What? I've never even seen you before!]]></string>
<string id="528880"><![CDATA[The Saburovs have adopted me! They wouldn't have believed such an absurd lie!]]></string>
<string id="528881"><![CDATA[The Bachelor paid a visit to Alexander. He made an offer that Saburov simply could not refuse. Well, they still have some affection for you; so I don't think they are going to have you arrested. However, you will no longer find shelter with them. Where will you stay? You can rest your head in my place, if you agree to humour me with a heartfelt confession.]]></string>
<string id="528882"><![CDATA[What? Who used my head as a guarantee?]]></string>
<string id="528883"><![CDATA[All the evil deeds that I have been accused of... were committed by my sister.]]></string>
<string id="528886"><![CDATA[That was all her! ]]></string>
<string id="528887"><![CDATA[The Bachelor is an astute, perspicacious man. It is only a matter of time before he figures out which line of enquiry is most feasible. Before then, you could tell me... where does your sister stand in relation to you? How did she come to be? I doubt your inelegant fabrications were enough to bring her to life.]]></string>
<string id="528888"><![CDATA[No… What?]]></string>
<string id="528889"><![CDATA[People who'd been in the streets and faced the threat of infection were being sheltered at the Cathedral, per the Bachelor's orders. He had had something in between a shelter and an isolation ward set up there. Last night, a disease carrier infiltrated it and infected the entire crowd with Sand Plague.]]></string>
<string id="528890"><![CDATA[That's horrible! Are they all dead?]]></string>
<string id="528891"><![CDATA[Yes. Almost four hundred people. And I have no doubt that the real culprit behind our present calamity is going to meet her end today.]]></string>
<string id="528892"><![CDATA[Who could it be?]]></string>
<string id="528893"><![CDATA[I'm positive that a certain Yulia Lyuricheva is the perpetrator. Items belonging to her have been found at the Cathedral. Waste no time—or she will escape the reckoning. Expose that warlock! Or else somebody will warn her... or accuse someone else. Yes?]]></string>
<string id="528894"><![CDATA[Who are the Inquisitors? ]]></string>
<string id="528895"><![CDATA[Ah... you don't know. They are horrible creatures. Government envoys who specialize in unresolvable situations. Intellectuals with a licence to put the most perverse plans and arrangements to a practical test—all for the sake of efficiency.]]></string>
<string id="528896"><![CDATA[But you're going to stop them from wreaking havoc, aren't you?]]></string>
<string id="528897"><![CDATA[The worst thing is that they enjoy an unrestricted mandate. Stopping an Inquisitor is as impossible as stopping a ghost—or time. If they want something done, they will do it.]]></string>
<string id="528898"><![CDATA[But how can I get closer to that Yulia? She's clever and, I think, has an iron peg for a heart... There's no hook with which to catch her.]]></string>
<string id="528899"><![CDATA[I don't know who you are, what kind of a demon you are, but I have a feeling that you exist in two concurrent guises. I do not wish to take my chances anymore.]]></string>
<string id="528900"><![CDATA[You're... not being serious, are you? It's some kind of a practical joke, isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="528901"><![CDATA[Out! Do not attempt to move me with your words! Perhaps you've kept me under your hypnosis all along? Go away! I shall not be held for a fool any longer.]]></string>
<string id="528902"><![CDATA[So you've joined the host of my persecutors too now! And I believed in you so much!]]></string>
<string id="528903"><![CDATA[Bit of a late epiphany there, eh... daddy?]]></string>
<string id="528904"><![CDATA[All right. I'll leave... You don't need to yell.]]></string>
<string id="528905"><![CDATA[I have a feeling that this is the last time we're talking like this... as a loving father and an obedient daughter.]]></string>
<string id="528906"><![CDATA[You'll be inviting me back soon. ]]></string>
<string id="528907"><![CDATA[What will you ask of me today?]]></string>
<string id="528908"><![CDATA[Today we'll attempt to convert Vlad the Younger; we'll search for allies among the Termites.]]></string>
<string id="528909"><![CDATA[Whatever you say.]]></string>
<string id="528910"><![CDATA[I've thought of approaching Victor—he's a more powerful figure—but the Utopians are much too fierce. Our escapade yesterday must have infuriated Maria.]]></string>
<string id="528911"><![CDATA[He's a simple person. He doesn't need recommendations or introductions. That said, he is cynical. We need an incentive... He loves money most of all... but he has other weaknesses too. After all, he's not digging that well for the money! I doubt he's looking for treasure there...]]></string>
<string id="528912"><![CDATA[What am I to do?]]></string>
<string id="528913"><![CDATA[I can't tell a lie. Just like you! I'm your heiress.]]></string>
<string id="528914"><![CDATA[Ask whoever you like.]]></string>
<string id="528915"><![CDATA[Have you lost hope?]]></string>
<string id="528916"><![CDATA[Farewell… Katerina.]]></string>
<string id="528917"><![CDATA[I'm not my own enemy…]]></string>
<string id="528918"><![CDATA[The Bachelor said that he and the Haruspex have been trying to solve the riddle posed by the mysterious blood that appears to be strangely identical to Simon's. The answer to the riddle is hiding inside the Termitary, risking his life every minute. If you go there, we will provide you with medicine, weapons, and protective clothing.]]></string>
<string id="528919"><![CDATA[What do I have to do with this?]]></string>
<string id="528920"><![CDATA[That's what I want to find out.]]></string>
<string id="528921"><![CDATA[All right. I'll go.]]></string>
<string id="528924"><![CDATA[I'll make it so everyone will be saved.]]></string>
<string id="528925"><![CDATA[So what is it? Or did you hope to intimidate me by saying the name of my daughter-in-law?]]></string>
<string id="528926"><![CDATA[Would your attitude change if I told you that my visit will determine the fate of the Polyhedron?]]></string>
<string id="528927"><![CDATA[Do you believe your visit is that significant? Now it's you who will answer my questions candidly and without prejudice. Are you one of Aglaya's confederates?]]></string>
<string id="528928"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="528929"><![CDATA[No. I am her victim.]]></string>
<string id="528930"><![CDATA[How did you know?]]></string>
<string id="528931"><![CDATA[Aglaya would grasp at any formal pretexts that would allow her to file her report as soon as possible. You are yet to visit the Tower, but all the conclusions from your visit have already been drawn... Nevertheless, one should always hope for a miracle.]]></string>
<string id="528932"><![CDATA[How can I help you?]]></string>
<string id="528933"><![CDATA[What kind of things are they? Do tell.]]></string>
<string id="528934"><![CDATA[If you tell me something first. Why is that tower so precious to you?]]></string>
<string id="528935"><![CDATA[I'm afraid Nina will show you nothing, since you're no longer a child. All that you may possibly see there are cold walls and empty flights of stairs.]]></string>
<string id="528936"><![CDATA[You promised.]]></string>
<string id="528937"><![CDATA[Victor will open the path into the Polyhedron for you. Only he knows how to to earn the good favours of his beloved wife. He was the only one she'd ever listen to.]]></string>
<string id="528938"><![CDATA[Oh my, that's a lot to reflect on...]]></string>
<string id="528939"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="528940"><![CDATA[I hope this torture ends soon…]]></string>
<string id="528941"><![CDATA[Katerina would speak the same words every time the Rat Prophet possessed her...]]></string>
<string id="528942"><![CDATA[There's nothing but joy ahead. Isn't it so?]]></string>
<string id="528943"><![CDATA[Victor, I'm going to the Polyhedron. With Georgiy's permission…]]></string>
<string id="528944"><![CDATA[Yes, I know. But I am afraid you're not going to see anything there. I doubt that Nina will be favourably disposed towards you.]]></string>
<string id="528945"><![CDATA[We'll see. How can I get past the barrier?]]></string>
<string id="528946"><![CDATA[It's simple. Go all the way to the top. You'll see my son there. If he's not there, wait for him or tell one of the Dogheads to call for him. When he receives you, you should immediately—without answering any questions, without a greeting or an apology—say the following words: "Fains I!"]]></string>
<string id="528947"><![CDATA[Thank you. "Fains I"…]]></string>
<string id="528948"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="528949"><![CDATA[Because she loves me, and is pained by the thought of me having to part with my life... without even a guarantee that the whole affair will be a success.]]></string>
<string id="528950"><![CDATA[What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="528951"><![CDATA[You can't even begin to imagine the immense power of voluntary self-sacrifice. Don't you know there've been examples in history where someone living would give their life so that someone deceased could spend a little more time with their loved ones?]]></string>
<string id="528952"><![CDATA[No... My knowledge of history is... well... not great.]]></string>
<string id="528953"><![CDATA[…Nina is not just my beloved wife. She is a spirit in whose name one could charge into battle with despair itself. Nina has imbued the town with spiritual force; Nina has breathed life into it—and Nina too will save it from the Fourth Army and its cannons!]]></string>
<string id="528954"><![CDATA[You want to sacrifice your life for Nina?]]></string>
<string id="528955"><![CDATA[But what about Simon? I thought he was the town's protector.]]></string>
<string id="528956"><![CDATA[Any member of the Circle of the Bound will readily sacrifice themselves for the sake of the Town's salvation. Had Simon been a giant, with enough blood in him to fill an ocean, the Town would have been saved. But Simon's blood was only enough for a handful of people...]]></string>
<string id="528957"><![CDATA[Then my sympathies are with you completely!]]></string>
<string id="528958"><![CDATA[Pity about that. History provides a better understanding of the modern times.]]></string>
<string id="528959"><![CDATA[That's deep! So how do I get into the Polyhedron?]]></string>
<string id="528960"><![CDATA[How do I get into the Polyhedron?]]></string>
<string id="528961"><![CDATA[Good. An honest and straightforward answer. Well then, prepare for quite an ordeal…]]></string>
<string id="528962"><![CDATA[Wait. First I'd like to know what this Tower is.]]></string>
<string id="528963"><![CDATA[This Tower? It's a toy that makes any adventure pale in comparison. It's a treasure. It gives the gift of dreams. Here, the most fragile fantasy can be played with forever. Here you can share your dreams with others and play in them together.]]></string>
<string id="528964"><![CDATA[But a dream can be retold if it's worth it…]]></string>
<string id="528965"><![CDATA[Yeah, or drawn or... I mean, that's just silly! Don't you know that the most precious aspects of dreams—the things that make you want to keep on dreaming forever and never wake up again—vanish moments after you wake up? A dream can't be recorded or retold. The magic is gone then.]]></string>
<string id="528966"><![CDATA[And now let me in.]]></string>
<string id="528967"><![CDATA[I do! I do wish to become one of you.]]></string>
<string id="528968"><![CDATA[Are you saying this Tower can preserve dreams?]]></string>
<string id="528969"><![CDATA[Not just preserve them! Bring them back! Continue them! Share them with others. Not just the characters and the worlds, but the very fragrances of the ether. The most magical of dream experiences. The most precious of fantasized events.]]></string>
<string id="528970"><![CDATA[What, these bare walls can do that?]]></string>
<string id="528971"><![CDATA[Are you seeing bare walls? I feel sorry for you.]]></string>
<string id="528972"><![CDATA[And what do you see?]]></string>
<string id="528973"><![CDATA[I see ships aflame, traversing the islands of Orion.]]></string>
<string id="528974"><![CDATA[We won't find a lot of mutual understanding.]]></string>
<string id="528975"><![CDATA[Come in and look around. I'd have gladly showed you what I'd like to see—but you're a grown-up already.]]></string>
<string id="528976"><![CDATA[It's all right.]]></string>
<string id="528977"><![CDATA[Well done. You're brave.]]></string>
<string id="528978"><![CDATA[Taya Tycheek? Not a lot of smart there to outsmart. She can lead herself up a garden path on her own just fine. How about... we remind Khan who's in charge instead?]]></string>
<string id="528979"><![CDATA[Mother says you once brought an exceptional storyteller to her.]]></string>
<string id="528980"><![CDATA[Wait! Does she like fairy tales? Taya, I mean...]]></string>
<string id="528981"><![CDATA[She does. The catch is, she knows every single one. She was nursed by odonghs, and they're great storytellers. She's heard them all!]]></string>
<string id="528982"><![CDATA[We haven't had the real conversation yet... sister.]]></string>
<string id="528983"><![CDATA[Did he take the inheritance from you by force?]]></string>
<string id="528984"><![CDATA[Nonsense! Why would he take by force what's rightfully his own?]]></string>
<string id="528985"><![CDATA[Who is he?]]></string>
<string id="528986"><![CDATA[He is a Warden. He is of menkhu stock; his father was a surgeon. I revere him. Soon he will overthrow the usurper, become leader of the Kin, and inaugurate a new era. Then I shall go back and vanish into the Earth.]]></string>
<string id="528987"><![CDATA[Utopia?]]></string>
<string id="528988"><![CDATA[There are three nodes nourishing our town. The town had been growing until the nodes closed. The Earth begat beasts. The Beasts sustained Humans. The Humans begat a settlement. The settlement sustains the children. The head had been drawing juices in excess. The plague closed the nodes. Everything resumed its natural course.]]></string>
<string id="528989"><![CDATA[What does that mean?]]></string>
<string id="528990"><![CDATA[The Settlement is a burden on the Earth. The Utopia is destroying the Settlement. The plague will destroy the Utopia. The Sand Pest is a creature of the plague—the will of the Law. I used to think it was my destiny. Now I see that it's yours.]]></string>
<string id="528991"><![CDATA[No. Not mine!]]></string>
<string id="528992"><![CDATA[What's a "Utopia"?]]></string>
<string id="528993"><![CDATA[The Utopia is a whim. A desire for the impossible. Children don't know the value of presents. They don't know that happiness is ephemeral. They want it to be full and never-ending. Before, life itself used to curb such things. The mirror trap had shut out the laws of life; it had left them outside. And so the Plague had to intervene.]]></string>
<string id="528994"><![CDATA[But the suffering is dealt out to everyone! Why not just smite the Tower?]]></string>
<string id="528995"><![CDATA[The town and the Tower are no longer separable. The town sustains it—feeds it with its children. The town exists for the Tower's sake. Just listen to them, they're all obsessing over some new construction project. That's what they believe to be their mission, led on by their blind rulers. That's the dream that gives a meaning to their futile existence.]]></string>

<string id="529002"><![CDATA[...Not just that. I am no more of a Priest than Katerina is a Mistress... It all started because of us.

<string id="529128"><![CDATA[Could it have been... just a woman?]]></string>
<string id="529129"><![CDATA[It was the disease in human form. A spirit. If my Master said this is possible, then it must be so. And she did have the face of a woman. I know nothing else—except that my teacher didn't die of the disease; he was murdered.]]></string>
<string id="529130"><![CDATA[How did you pick those people?]]></string>
<string id="529131"><![CDATA[For years, I have been keeping order in this town and looking out for possible criminals. I trust my clairvoyant wife's judgement. Even that trust, however, I would have thought unduly partial, but for seeing my hypothesis confirmed by her rival Mistresses.]]></string>
<string id="529132"><![CDATA[So what do you expect from me?]]></string>
<string id="529133"><![CDATA[I only want one thing, and that is—justice! This is a case where we can dispense with evidence and trials. When the last dawn is rising above the world, it is time for arguments of a different nature. A trial resting on conscience, and a verdict resting on faith. Find the culprit for us! It is why you've come into this world, and into our house, the house of the town's rulers.]]></string>
<string id="529134"><![CDATA[...Who should I begin with?]]></string>
<string id="529135"><![CDATA[A mysterious creature named Aspity will, I am sure, be the best start. Children say she is an evil spirit. Simon didn't like her. That bitch has been called a walking plague even before this. I'm sure that a woman, a maneater, and a spawn of the Steppe—which is exactly what a shabnak is—is a fitting description for her.]]></string>
<string id="529136"><![CDATA[How do I make her reveal herself after I've gained her trust? Who can tell me something about her that she'd be surprised to hear?]]></string>
<string id="529137"><![CDATA[Right... You don't know anybody here... The shortest way is via the Olgimskys. Ask Vlad the Younger, Olgimsky's son. The Olgimskys must have old scores to settle with her. Besides, Vlad the Younger is knowledgeable about the legends and traditions of the Steppe people... He will instruct you.]]></string>
<string id="529138"><![CDATA[Yes, exactly!]]></string>
<string id="529139"><![CDATA[Not good... So there's been no miracle.]]></string>
<string id="529140"><![CDATA[No. She isn't.]]></string>
<string id="529141"><![CDATA[Olgimsky was asking…]]></string>
<string id="529142"><![CDATA[Ha ha! The old shark... Right... so if Vlad finds out that this cutthroat has learned to mix herbs, the guy's in for it! Vlad the Wholesaler's already got what, eight thousand indentured servants—what's one more?]]></string>
<string id="529143"><![CDATA[Ouch…]]></string>
<string id="529144"><![CDATA[It's up to you if I should rat him out to Vlad. The Haruspex will be useful to you, so don't cross him... He'll figure out who the snitch was right away. I can sell you some immune system boosters, but they'll cost you.]]></string>
<string id="529145"><![CDATA[You're so pretty too! Sweet as sugar, really.]]></string>
<string id="529146"><![CDATA[And how do you know that? Now... look me in the eye, Anna! What was it you said yesterday about evildoers?]]></string>
<string id="529147"><![CDATA[Look here... Leave me alone, my dear, and I will show my gratitude. I have means too, didn't you know? I'll tell you another thing. That Ripper, the one from yesterday—the Olgimskys have given him shelter. So the thing is—they don't have to snatch medicine from the people. He knows how to make his own!]]></string>
<string id="529148"><![CDATA[Really?]]></string>
<string id="529149"><![CDATA[Common folk are gossiping about it already. His father knew the secret! And he, the Ripper, has been concealing his art from Vlad... because there's a mystery involved, and he needs blood! And he probably guessed that Olgimsky would make him work to return the favour. I wish he did just that! Just show this mixture to Vlad, and he'll have that man chained to the wall by his leg at once.]]></string>
<string id="529150"><![CDATA[Don't be obstinate, my dear.]]></string>

<string id="529159"><![CDATA[Ah, so you don't know... She's a woman living in the kip on the edge of Earth. Some people call the place a "hospice".]]></string>
<string id="529160"><![CDATA[Ha ha... An excellent recommendation.]]></string>

<string id="529168"><![CDATA[You'll find all of them herb dealers at the den. Now there's a ruthless man that runs the place, an artist and a builder, and from across the Steppe too, from where no one lives but dressed-up deaders and the spawn of Suok... Here, he brews his twyre brews, and he blasphemes, and he blasts curses over them!]]></string>
<string id="529169"><![CDATA[Blasphemes? How?]]></string>
<string id="529170"><![CDATA[He ill-treats them herbs, he tests how much they'll take... He buys them up more 'spensive than we can. And he stirred up some bad blood among our lot; made us kill them with our own hands, them as had been giving him the secret spices... If you find some herb, don't sell it to him. He'll hurt the herb.]]></string>
<string id="529171"><![CDATA[Would you like me to sell it to you?]]></string>
<string id="529172"><![CDATA[There's more than one haruspex round these parts... ay, they are many, the knowing ones. Which one are you looking for? The biggest and meanest of them, that would be Foreman Oyun. He was here two days ago; stomped out our fires, so he did, and trampled on our yurts. If we hadn't taken cover, his hooves had sure been the end of us.]]></string>
<string id="529173"><![CDATA[Did he bring you any herbal concoctions?]]></string>
<string id="529174"><![CDATA[He did. But I wouldn't take none. So he took them to them dealers, who buy and sell again.]]></string>
<string id="529175"><![CDATA[Who are those dealers?]]></string>

<string id="529184"><![CDATA[Exactly, Grace. Think about what I said. And now wake up, it's done. It's all over.]]></string>
<string id="529185"><![CDATA[Of course!]]></string>
<string id="529186"><![CDATA[That simple? And what do I give Grace herself?]]></string>
<string id="529187"><![CDATA[She doesn't need anything. With people like Grace and me, it's the good done to one's neighbour that matters. I thought you understood that.]]></string>
<string id="529188"><![CDATA[I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="529189"><![CDATA[These are our parties. The first thing, the original creation, was the Earth. The ancient one, giving life to plants and animals. She begat the Abattoir; she begat the Kin. She gives and she takes. The dead go into her; everything ends with her. She is the inception and the completion. Such is the Law. We, the Saburovs, act in the interests of the Law, by which everyone must abide. Ours is a faith of Humility.]]></string>
<string id="529190"><![CDATA[A wise faith.]]></string>
<string id="529191"><![CDATA[A town sprang up upon the Earth. A town of men was built upon her, the Earth eternal, the giver of life: built by greed and creativity, by ingenuity and hard work. The Abattoir found its continuation in the Works and the railway. The hands of the Olgimskys crafted an environment in which people could develop and reflect. Theirs is a faith of Construction.]]></string>
<string id="529192"><![CDATA[A necessary faith.]]></string>
<string id="529193"><![CDATA[Finally, the minds of people desiring to overcome the limits set for human beings by their nature and condition, engendered projects that were fantastic and audacious. That was how the party of creativity and invention emerged and flourished: the party of the Kains. Theirs is a faith of Utopia. A belief in miracles. A belief in a non-existent place.]]></string>
<string id="529194"><![CDATA[A weird faith...]]></string>
<string id="529195"><![CDATA[I foresee myself knowing why this punishment has befallen us. The town lived, grew, developed, and finally tried to break free of its own limitations. The Earth that had borne it hit it on its head, which it had stuck out too far—much like a strict mother would do to her unthinking child.]]></string>
<string id="529196"><![CDATA[Yes, Katerina. I believe that our faith is the true one.]]></string>
<string id="529197"><![CDATA[You will speak to those Bound to you about the truth of Humility. You are to convince one of them, two of them, three of them of the true faith's wisdom. Should some of them prove stubborn, you will use the powers that were granted to you by providence itself.]]></string>
<string id="529198"><![CDATA[With Grace? Doesn't she sympathize with you... with us?]]></string>
<string id="529199"><![CDATA[I want to be certain of that. Make friends with her. Try to make her like you and grow an affection for you eventually. You don't need much for this. And if you need to find out more about her, Lara Ravel is the person who will tell you all about Grace. She is as much of an angel of kindness as the poor daughter of the caretaker... and her father has recently died too.]]></string>
<string id="529200"><![CDATA[So this is the will of the Earth?]]></string>
<string id="529201"><![CDATA[I believe that the Earth wishes to return unto herself what has moved waywardly out of her reach. And before I explain to you the path that I am setting before you, I want to know for certain whether I have my dear child on my side.]]></string>
<string id="529202"><![CDATA[I'll look around and use my judgement. For now, I must obey: there is no other way ahead for me.]]></string>
<string id="529203"><![CDATA[She believes and thinks the same way as we do.]]></string>
<string id="529204"><![CDATA[I made her change her mind, just like that! It seemed like the right thing to do.]]></string>

<string id="529209"><![CDATA[She's the reason for all of the Kin's riots and unrest! No one has ever harmed our family more. Sometimes I feel she's an evil spirit. She appeared suddenly... after one of the riots. At the time, my father had brutally crushed the revolting butchers; and it was then that he'd appointed Oyun as their Foreman.]]></string>
<string id="529210"><![CDATA[Is that so!]]></string>
<string id="529211"><![CDATA[Yes... And ever since then, I've thought of her as a personification of the Kin's defiance. I've even begun to confuse cause and consequence. Did she appear to avenge our cruelty, or are her provocations forcing my father's hand? It's become a vicious circle!]]></string>

<string id="529228"><![CDATA[Yes, yes… The thing is, Katerina's barren. She can't predict the future. That creature can, though, and it visits her at night. Unlike a true Mistress, however, it can tell lies—and it's certainly good at telling the right lies.]]></string>
<string id="529229"><![CDATA[I've come to ask what's going to happen to the theatre now…]]></string>
<string id="529230"><![CDATA[Where is he then? Where? Don't keep me waiting!]]></string>
<string id="529231"><![CDATA[He may have gone to seek justice from the rulers... Will he find it? Or he may have found shelter with some good friends... But are they really his friends? Time will tell, my child... time will tell. And you—go and live your life. While you still can.]]></string>
<string id="529232"><![CDATA[There's no need to hurry... Whoever's waiting for you, can wait some more.]]></string>
<string id="529233"><![CDATA[I...]]></string>
<string id="529234"><![CDATA[...You've come to charm us. You're charming. No, don't say anything, you're doing a great job. But you really should've picked someone weaker for a start... Then this wouldn't have felt so inane, and we could do away with you without a second thought. When it's like this, though, we just don't have the heart...]]></string>
<string id="529235"><![CDATA[What is it?]]></string>
<string id="529236"><![CDATA[There's a manhunt going on for young Burakh. It appears that your patron, Alexander, is behind it. But he's unfair towards Burakh.]]></string>
<string id="529237"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="529238"><![CDATA[The Haruspex doesn't just chop up the dead for his own amusement. He's trying to create a panacea. Please, find out what's happening and stop Alexander's punishing hand. He's blinded.]]></string>
<string id="529239"><![CDATA[I'm ready.]]></string>
<string id="529240"><![CDATA[...Today we shall strike where they don't expect us to... You will talk to Mark Immortell... He is the director at the Theatre who stages prophetic mime performances with his Masks... Some time ago, he staged a performance about the death of King Kuron... He knew Simon would die...]]></string>
<string id="529241"><![CDATA[You're shaking. Why? There's even sweat on your brow…]]></string>
<string id="529242"><![CDATA[...This is almost too important for me... I've had a prophetic dream in which the Bachelor was going to turn the Theatre into a leper colony... Just let Mark Immortell know about this... let him find a way to stop it... I need the Theatre badly! We need it... I can feel it...]]></string>
<string id="529243"><![CDATA[So? ...Why are you looking at me like that? This was not the most important of what you were going to tell me, was it?]]></string>
<string id="529244"><![CDATA[Do you know of the Rat Prophet?]]></string>
<string id="529245"><![CDATA[No, nothing... mommy. I still haven't talked to him.]]></string>
<string id="529246"><![CDATA[...I sense something. When you uttered those words, I suddenly felt something familiar... as if something ran its sharp little claws across my back...]]></string>
<string id="529247"><![CDATA[It's the creature that whispers false prophesies to you in your sleep!]]></string>
<string id="529248"><![CDATA[It's my duty.]]></string>
<string id="529249"><![CDATA[Now I'm convinced that Grief is the culprit! This man, this kingpin of the Warehouses, smuggler and death peddler, has now let gangs of thugs loose on the streets. You can see what's going on. They cut people down; they murder women; they rob homes... They are too much for the patrolmen.]]></string>
<string id="529250"><![CDATA[…But how could he have caused the epidemic?]]></string>
<string id="529251"><![CDATA[Bachelor Dankovsky found during his investigation that Grief had ordered thieves to dump infected corpses into the river. Anything up to... several dozen. The thieves refuse to reveal the location. In fact, they are altogether denying having done it. But the claim must certainly be examined.]]></string>
<string id="529252"><![CDATA[...That's just horrible! And yet the infected corpses had to have come from somewhere!]]></string>
<string id="529253"><![CDATA[That's what I'd like to know. I'd like to know if it's true, and if yes, the exact location where they dumped those corpses... before we stamp out this whole nest of vipers. And we are going to have to stamp it out. He has done too much evil already, this Grief. Perhaps he is not directly responsible—but indirectly is enough for us.]]></string>
<string id="529254"><![CDATA[Gladly!]]></string>
<string id="529255"><![CDATA[Will our manpower suffice? There are cutthroats everywhere…]]></string>
<string id="529256"><![CDATA[You won't have to fight bandits. Do you really think I'm asking you to do what I've just talked our bloodthirsty Bachelor out of? I have already assembled a round-up squad led by a brave patrolman named Wolf. They will find the killers' lair... once Grief's guilt is proven.]]></string>
<string id="529257"><![CDATA[I had a hunch about what might be in the bag…]]></string>
<string id="529258"><![CDATA[...My most trusted patrolman! The sharpest, the most skilful and daring! I had him in mind as the replacement for Yaklakh, who had gone missing... Who am I to rely on now? Ah, the blackguard! He has as good as cut off my right hand! I've had enough! Where did you say they were hiding?]]></string>
<string id="529259"><![CDATA[In a large, semicircular warehouse on this side of the river. It's quite nearby.]]></string>
<string id="529260"><![CDATA[They are all done for... I'll crush these ones today, and the rest of them tomorrow! Let Grief breathe for now; he must be in a panic himself. We shall see in two days... So you haven't asked about the river yet?]]></string>
<string id="529261"><![CDATA[Yes, and it's good that you've mentioned it.]]></string>
<string id="529262"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="529263"><![CDATA[But how?]]></string>
<string id="529264"><![CDATA[Tell him that doctor Rubin is waiting for him back home, with urgent business to discuss. This Rubin, by the way, is himself highly suspicious... Are the rumours true that he refuses to hand over Simon's body to the Kains? Georgiy is furious. Something's wrong here...]]></string>
<string id="529265"><![CDATA[And—]]></string>
<string id="529266"><![CDATA[He's in one of the infected houses. Be quick. This will be more proof that you stand on the side of the Law.]]></string>
<string id="529267"><![CDATA[Indeed…]]></string>
<string id="529268"><![CDATA[Lara Ravel took note of this house. That Harpist of hers went there…]]></string>
<string id="529269"><![CDATA[I have warned the Haruspex. Lara will rejoice at the news.]]></string>
<string id="529270"><![CDATA[The deed is done. Yet again I surpassed my father's expectations and did what a group of armed patrolmen was unable to accomplish. I should inform him at once.]]></string>
<string id="529271"><![CDATA[It is as you said. Yes, I am her moulded cast, her harbinger, bringing justice. The hour is nigh when you shall have to bow down to me.]]></string>
<string id="529272"><![CDATA[Yes, I do get called a thief, but I have no idea why. I haven't stolen anything.]]></string>
<string id="529273"><![CDATA[Sorry. I often do this. I'm curious! I like meddling in all sorts of things I'm not supposed to meddle in. I guess that's why they call me a thief. And why do they call you a thief?]]></string>
<string id="529274"><![CDATA[Is that what they're calling me? I don't remember ever stealing anything.]]></string>
<string id="529275"><![CDATA[Perhaps you're going to steal something? Make sure you do it carefully.]]></string>
<string id="529276"><![CDATA[That happens a lot. You steal something and can't remember it afterwards. Must've been something important—or else something you don't just put in your pocket. Someone's name, maybe?]]></string>
<string id="529277"><![CDATA[So I'm getting shamed for a crime I haven't committed yet? You're a funny fellow.]]></string>

<string id="529279"><![CDATA[Death…]]></string>
<string id="529280"><![CDATA[Yes! And, as would befit an angel, you smell of herbs: the spicy twyre and the harsh swevery... What is your name?]]></string>
<string id="529281"><![CDATA[I'd never have thought death to have green eyes. But it all depends on the state you're in, I suppose... And do you have a name?]]></string>

<string id="529283"><![CDATA[Call me Clara.]]></string>

<string id="529285"><![CDATA[...Why are you lying to me? No, your tricks aren't going to baffle me... I have after all read a lot about you—creatures fashioned out of clay and bones. I know what's said about you in the Tale of the Daughters, and in the Baur Meges too.]]></string>
<string id="529286"><![CDATA[Whoa! Don't joke like that... I hereby solemnly declare that none of that refers to me.]]></string>
<string id="529287"><![CDATA[Then you oughtn't to be baffled by my simple tricks.]]></string>
<string id="529288"><![CDATA[And what did I tell you?]]></string>

<string id="529293"><![CDATA[…None what-so-ever!]]></string>
<string id="529294"><![CDATA[Your manner's telling me that you're a person of influence... and your voice, that you're very unhappy.]]></string>

<string id="529300"><![CDATA[Eva. Eva Yan... And you must be here to see the Bachelor?]]></string>
<string id="529301"><![CDATA[Goodness no! That's an encounter I hope I'll be spared.]]></string>
<string id="529302"><![CDATA[I'm here to see you, Eva Yan. Hello.]]></string>
<string id="529303"><![CDATA[I have a name. I'm Clara.]]></string>
<string id="529304"><![CDATA[Now that's a question I didn't expect... Smart thief, you!]]></string>

<string id="529306"><![CDATA[The Changeling, right? I've heard a lot about you. Let's talk. I hope the cigarette smoke is no major nuisance? For reasons quite obvious I'd rather not open the window.]]></string>
<string id="529307"><![CDATA[Why "The Changeling"?]]></string>
<string id="529308"><![CDATA[Nevermind. No particular reason... Do you have any business with me?]]></string>
<string id="529309"><![CDATA[Nevermind. No particular reason... ]]></string>
<string id="529310"><![CDATA[I've come to get acquainted with you.]]></string>
<string id="529311"><![CDATA[I am no one. An instrument in the hands of a force whose name is not to be taken in vain. And who are you?]]></string>
<string id="529312"><![CDATA[…It's odd that you don't know who I am. I'm Capella. And even though I've never seen you before, I feel a gnawing uneasiness for some reason…]]></string>
<string id="529313"><![CDATA[There's definitely a reason.]]></string>
<string id="529314"><![CDATA[I'm Clara. You haven't heard of me yet.]]></string>
<string id="529315"><![CDATA[You're against the rules. I don't want you visiting the Theatre.]]></string>
<string id="529316"><![CDATA[No one can prohibit me from entering.]]></string>
<string id="529317"><![CDATA[I may be useful to you yet…]]></string>
<string id="529318"><![CDATA[You bring us nothing but misfortune!]]></string>
<string id="529319"><![CDATA[You have to be patient, Mother... Such is fate.]]></string>
<string id="529320"><![CDATA[I thought the opposite…]]></string>
<string id="529321"><![CDATA[Whatever happens, I'm only fulfilling my purpose.]]></string>
<string id="529322"><![CDATA[You shall visit a singer named Anna Angel. Of all the black souls in our town, this is the blackest. The Willows used to be the happiest house in this side of the town, and we were happy to have such neighbours. Now every crack in the walls of that house is oozing blood and tears.]]></string>
<string id="529323"><![CDATA[My God... what happened there?]]></string>
<string id="529324"><![CDATA[No one knows. Ever since Anna came to our town, she has always gotten away with whatever she did. Neither does anyone know what happened to all the former dwellers of that house. They had been a family, and a tight-knit one...]]></string>
<string id="529325"><![CDATA[Do you suspect her?]]></string>
<string id="529326"><![CDATA[I suspect that one of the bloodthirstiest ghouls that walk the earth has infiltrated our town in the shape of this singer! Have you heard about the Caravan? Of course you haven't... Ask her about it and see what she has to say.]]></string>
<string id="529327"><![CDATA[I have no will but yours, father…]]></string>
<string id="529328"><![CDATA[Are you sure? Clara?]]></string>
<string id="529329"><![CDATA[…I am sure.]]></string>
<string id="529330"><![CDATA[Who is guilty then?]]></string>
<string id="529331"><![CDATA[I don't know! Are there no more bad people left in town? Don't you want to know who caused the disease?]]></string>
<string id="529332"><![CDATA[You're being hunted, Ripper! Beware. They're closing in.]]></string>
<string id="529333"><![CDATA[Ripper? Me? How did I get a shameful nickname like that?]]></string>
<string id="529334"><![CDATA[Indeed? The Bachelor is very close. He won't hesitate to shoot, and you are unarmed.]]></string>
<string id="529335"><![CDATA[You know what? Don't tip them off. I'm not planning anything evil... Wait, forget it, you're not going to believe me anyway. So look here: if you don't turn me over, I'll give you my concoctions. They're good; you'll see for yourself. Or are you really unaffected by the disease?]]></string>
<string id="529336"><![CDATA[Shout all you like... You've deserved this.]]></string>
<string id="529337"><![CDATA[It's just twyre, Anna... sleep.]]></string>
<string id="529338"><![CDATA[And so...?]]></string>
<string id="529339"><![CDATA[And so now, of course, he wants to kill her because of the Caravan. His Dogheads must have been prowling about the town looking for people with Caravan connections. Now they know, but the epidemic has struck in the meantime... As soon as he pulls himself together after his grandfather's death and is done setting up the Polyhedron's defences, he will surely dispatch a revenge squad to Anna.]]></string>
<string id="529340"><![CDATA[That was unexpected…]]></string>
<string id="529341"><![CDATA[I will prefer to ignore what you have told me. Beware! I have my own relationship with the Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="529674"><![CDATA[]]></string>

<string id="529706"><![CDATA["The Curative Substances"]]></string>
<string id="529707"><![CDATA[It has transpired that Anna was sitting on a large stockpile of medicine. That is peculiary prudent of her... This isn't going to be an easy task, but I will have to convince her to give up her stash for the common good.]]></string>
<string id="529708"><![CDATA[Anna told me a herb gatherer would know who the buyer of Haruspex's curative infusions was.]]></string>
<string id="529709"><![CDATA[I can take the medicine supply to Vlad the Younger. Everything will be fair and equal now.]]></string>
<string id="529710"><![CDATA[The medicine produced by the Haruspex was bought by Andrey Stamatin—a famous artist known to frequent the twyrine shebeen.]]></string>
<string id="529711"><![CDATA[Too much controversy. Why do they care? Mass-produced chemicals and natural herb infusions can't perform miracles. The most that can be hoped for is to delay the inevitable. They must be blind, for they seek salvation in all the wrong places. Whom should I offer to sate the appetites of Vlad the Younger? It really doesn't matter.]]></string>
<string id="529712"><![CDATA[*** I gave Anna's medicine supply to Vlad the Younger.]]></string>
<string id="529713"><![CDATA[*** I didn't manage to keep Anna's supply.]]></string>
<string id="529714"><![CDATA[*** I gave up the Haruspex. The more that monster suffers, the better.]]></string>
<string id="529715"><![CDATA[*** I didn't give up the Haruspex.]]></string>
<string id="529716"><![CDATA[I've changed my mind. I will go to the Polyhedron... I myself am curious to know what's so extraordinary about it.]]></string>
<string id="529717"><![CDATA[You don't have to go if you don't want to. Nobody's forcing you. I'll just note that you've instinctively recoiled from the Polyhedron. Haven't you?]]></string>

<string id="529722"><![CDATA[Is it like when people let a cat inside a new house, so that it lies down at the coziest place?]]></string>
<string id="529723"><![CDATA[Something along those lines. You can be witty.]]></string>
<string id="529724"><![CDATA[Really? Amazing! You exceeded the expectations, then, since no one was demanding such dedication from you. ...It was I who have found out everything; you have helped me there... I even feel a certain degree of gratitude.]]></string>
<string id="529725"><![CDATA[…Why just a degree?]]></string>
<string id="529726"><![CDATA[Summing up the conclusions drawn from your discoveries, I shall combine the causal relationships into a coherent picture. I shall reveal the arcane nature of the disease to you from a mystical standpoint. That was how it should have been revealed to you; I suppose all that I will tell you will be no news to you. Still, it will determine the wording of your verdict.]]></string>
<string id="529727"><![CDATA[Because you are an instrument of the Law, and I am its servant. Both are doing their duty, but only the latter wilfully.]]></string>
<string id="529728"><![CDATA[I don't understand.]]></string>
<string id="529729"><![CDATA[Sounds ominous…]]></string>
<string id="529730"><![CDATA[Are you interested? Do listen, it's really about you. So the Earth begat the town. Two entirely different worlds that have nonetheless managed to achieve a symbiotic coexistence. That was a miracle. A true miracle. Normally, civilization devours tradition.]]></string>
<string id="529731"><![CDATA[I'm confused…]]></string>
<string id="529732"><![CDATA[As you can see, the town is small. It's made up of people, not ranks and functions. Fortuitous circumstances had enabled people to create an environment here that everyone could be happy in. But that was entirely due to a miraculous coincidence.]]></string>
<string id="529733"><![CDATA[What coincidence?]]></string>
<string id="529734"><![CDATA[It's rare that a succession of extraordinary personalities should stand at the helm for five generations. It's even rarer that they should have the love and respect for one another that allows them to carry on the policies of their predecessors. Here, they had grown used to the miracle. And that was their undoing. They wanted to learn to control the miracles. The elder generation had constructed an environment for bringing up the young in the same spirit. They paid for it.]]></string>
<string id="529735"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="529736"><![CDATA[The Law stipulates a harsh punishment for an attempt to capture a miracle. The disease is a means of restoring the balance. A part of the chimeric town must be destroyed, and there is no turning back. The town and the miracle cannot coexist. And I swear I know what the choice should be between them!]]></string>
<string id="529737"><![CDATA[Is this more of your claiming that I'm the disease?]]></string>
<string id="529738"><![CDATA[But what about me? What's going to happen to me?]]></string>
<string id="529739"><![CDATA[You are an instrument of the Law. But your mission has been accomplished. And it being my mission not merely to understand you but also to rein you in—I hereby prohibit you from existing, and banish you from the town. The captured Miracle shall pass into oblivion.]]></string>
<string id="529740"><![CDATA[I...]]></string>
<string id="529741"><![CDATA[You may vanish into the earth that you came from. Go. I permit you—both of you, to be exact—to die in any way you prefer. On one condition.

<string id="529742"><![CDATA[Farewell…]]></string>
<string id="529743"><![CDATA[Inquisitor Aglaya Lilich has prohibited me from seeing you. Why?]]></string>
<string id="529744"><![CDATA[Are you really this superstitious? Surely you were just making fun of me?]]></string>
<string id="529745"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor fears and detests me. I must say it's mutual. Most of all, I'm worried that the mission to save the town—or to destroy it, however you prefer to think of it—may degenerate into a long-range artillery duel. She's surely going to plot and scheme.]]></string>
<string id="529746"><![CDATA[But why is she overestimating my role in this so much?]]></string>
<string id="529747"><![CDATA[She isn't overestimating. I had been greatly impressed with you—long before I saw you.]]></string>
<string id="529748"><![CDATA[How is that possible?]]></string>
<string id="529749"><![CDATA[But she must follow your orders, mustn't she?]]></string>
<string id="529750"><![CDATA[On the contrary. My duty calls on me to obey the Inquisitor. But Lilich is always playing her own game. I've heard that she was once condemned to death for it—I suppose they pardoned her in the end... She will make a dishonest decision. One dictated, not by her duty, but by covert calculation. Both of the healers have clearly already been poisoned by her deception.]]></string>
<string id="529751"><![CDATA[On our way here, a lieutenant told me a legend about the holy sisters-in-arms of the warriors. He spoke of medieval wars, of pilgrimages, of the power of the Holy Spirit that led quiet and unassuming young girls—orphans, beggars and peasants—to call the might of great armies to a lofty duty. I was profoundly moved by his story.]]></string>
<string id="529752"><![CDATA[It was a mere coincidence.]]></string>
<string id="529753"><![CDATA[Coincidences like this don't happen by chance. No... I gave it a lot of thought as we were travelling here. His story had come at the right moment. My life was approaching a watershed.]]></string>
<string id="529754"><![CDATA[Speak on…]]></string>
<string id="529755"><![CDATA[Yes! My deployment to this plague-stricken little town was an expedition into hell. I was meant to die here—and so it will happen. The old Alexander Block will die—but a new one will emerge from this place. From this town, an army will set out on a glorious march—in the name of Truth.]]></string>
<string id="529756"><![CDATA[Why do you say they've sent you here to your death?]]></string>
<string id="529757"><![CDATA[I've long become inconvenient to the Supreme Command. Since I've started my reform of the armed forces. Since I've turned the tide of the war. Since I've made clear that I'm striving to make perpetual warfare—the livelihood of corrupt generals—a thing of the past. They've tried and failed to get me killed by enemy fire—so now they're taking their chances with an unknown strain of plague.]]></string>
<string id="529758"><![CDATA[Don't be afraid. No one will dare harm you.]]></string>
<string id="529759"><![CDATA[I am invulnerable.]]></string>
<string id="529760"><![CDATA[So the Powers That Be are hoping the plague will kill you?]]></string>
<string id="529761"><![CDATA[They are, and they're also hoping that this mission will disgrace me. I, Alexander Block, a hero of both campaigns, victorious and venerated by the people, now appear as a headsman and a scourge. When they gave me the assignment, they went out of their way to make clear how much the people are going to despise and detest the destroyer of this tiny town.]]></string>
<string id="529762"><![CDATA[Who?]]></string>
<string id="529763"><![CDATA[I feel that what they want the most is for this town to continue to exist. Diseased and miserable, in flames and pain, a smithy of shared suffering—but still there. They've sent the army in out of fear of popular opinion. The people wield power too.]]></string>
<string id="529764"><![CDATA[Then the people won't hate you…]]></string>
<string id="529765"><![CDATA[They will. The Powers That Be will take care of that. They know how to manipulate the masses. They will frame the town's destruction, not as a necessary sacrifice for the sake of public safety, but as a horrific mistake resulting from confusion. They will take all the credit for any good that will come out of this, and let me take all the backlash.]]></string>

<string id="529853"><![CDATA[We call these primitive antibiotics "dead gruel." They enrich the blood with the antibodies required to fight the disease. This is not even close to a panacea, though. It will take a number of exceptionally fortunate coincidences for the dead gruel to clear the infection completely (Rubin, myself).
The dead tissue was mixed with the solutions: "amber", "jade", "basalt."
"Basalt": brown twyre + black twyre + swevery (immune system 80 / harmful 15).
"Jade": swevery (3) + brown twyre (immune system 100 / harmful 15).

The highest concentration of the bacteria is to be found within the major circulatory organs. Liver—unpredictable. Blood offers the purest specimens available. Rubin suggests the arch.—won't do.

19. IX The blood of Bud.—enriched, starts to consume the infection, then nothing. ?
27. IX The blood II—enriched much too slow.
2. X The bst. blood—different! Blocks cellular transportation? The infection is not soaked...
...
The findings: a medium with high particular density is needed. More tests to be done! Applying the solutions of the "thick group" to infected organs may allow us to produce the vaccine-gruel. It will cure someone infected with Sand Plague—however late the stage.

Swevery would almost invariably boost the effect.

The clear group
The following herbs were combined:
"Amber"—brown twyre (2), swevery (2)
"Tar"—brown twyre (2), swevery

The astringent group
The following herbs were combined:
"Bitterness"—black twyre, brown twyre, swevery, white whip
"Smoke" —brown twyre (3), swevery

The earth gives birth to both herbs and plague. Beneath the ground, roots bind what is then released by sunlit seeds. Whenever nature enforces its will upon us, we must take heed to seek the way. Whoever says we should submit is unwise.]]></string>

Regrettably, there is still no good news for you. The antibodies do eliminate the infection, but the problem is that there's not nearly enough of them. The bacteria propagate much faster than they die; I see no way to reverse the process.

The regrettable conclusion is that human blood is not enough to produce a panacea by the method you described.

The blood of a human can cope with the bacteria, up to a point, but the antibodies are not nearly powerful enough to clear the infection. Even the antibodies contained in the blood of a Steppe person won't suffice to eliminate the sickness. The disease acts much faster than human organisms can react.

I have another idea how to handle it, though. Perhaps today we will discover a new material with which the panacea can be made.

The rulers lack even the nominal kind of authority. Aglaya's hands are tied. While she is still alive, she won't let the Commander raze and demolish at will.

That's the way it is. Ask her yourself. Block and I have her cornered. We have completely disarmed her, so she has no choice but to confess. My dear Burakh, she is your sacrifice!

I don't think it is at all necessary to slit her throat with your own knife. You see, if the town is destroyed, the head of Aglaya Lilich will be separated from her shoulders in less than a day.

It has transpired that this whole situation affords her a stay of her death warrant. If she presents the town entirely purged of any disease to the Powers That Be—she is granted pardon. The issue is, it is impossible. The disease has soaked the town, it keeps rising up from the very roots of it.

It is doubly deplorable that when she deceived you, she didn't merely save her life. She pursued her own purpose, too, which is to destroy the Polyhedron.

The disease can be destroyed only if we destroy the town. There is no other option. By your own reasoning, I cannot be wrong about it, can I? Please take this into consideration if you come to the Cathedral.

I have found my own path to victory, I think. Believe it or not. It is simple, but don't reject it in a hurry. Perhaps, this is also the only way for you to save yourself.

<string id="530576"><![CDATA[From this point forward, I am the eldest member of the Burakh family. A menkhu. I am the heir to my father, Isidor Burakh; a Warden of the Kin; the supreme menkhu of many years.

The inheritance of my father will nourish my mind and my body alike. It is a question of life and death for me to claim it, for it will imbue my dissolute existence with reason.

I am one of the menkhu; those who know the lines; those who open up the body; those who link the earthly to the under-earth. The duty of the menkhu is to serve the children of Boddho; to interpret coincidence; to point out decisions informed by wisdom. The very reason of my existence is to carry out this duty.

Who will I become if I will fail to bind my destiny with my father's calling?]]></string>
<string id="530577"><![CDATA[Behold the Sought One. The Named One; marked by the Brand. He is sick. He is dying. The earth has come up to his waist.

I must complete the task that my father left unfinished. I have yet to find out the identity of my patient, but I already know the answer to how his life may be prolonged.

There's talk of a Sand Pest outbreak. I don't know who is dying yet, but I know what they are dying of. The enemy that was once defeated by my father has returned with a vengeance. I wasn't left this box for its mundane value. There is more inside it than this unfinished deed; this unfulfilled duty.

There is knowledge inside; the formulas; the compoundings; the keys to create the only solution by which the Sought One may be cured; a panacea. I don't know yet who is at their deathbed, but I know how he may be brought back to life.

Two journeys await me. The first will lead me to the Sought One. The second will teach me how the panacea can be made. 

It is time to depart.]]></string>
<string id="530578"><![CDATA[Who will the Sought One be? Whom are we going to cure? Ever since I was a child, I knew that sacrifice is the only way to proceed.

This has nothing to do with superstition or with the prophecies of the Mistresses. This is just a fact: a sacrifice will have to be made. This sacrifice is what enables the udurgh to live. This has nothing to do with the ritual, but is rather suggested by the law of a higher justice. There is a sacrifice I should make, and I know what the offering is. This will be my only destination, regardless of the path I take. The offering dies, the Sought One lives. There is no other way.

Having said that, I remember that a Warden might appoint the offering himself, as long as the conditions are met. 

The offering, the rules dictate, should be appropriate. It should be proportionate. It should be linked closely to the one performing the sacrifice. Otherwise, what sacred power will the sacrifice bring forth? None whatsoever... 

So be it.]]></string>
<string id="530579"><![CDATA[Is any choice right as long as it's willed?

The lines did cross; the two opposite truths formed a line with a single surface. My victory will be flawed, regardless of the choice I make.

But how can they possibly manipulate me, a Warden? What do I, the Haruspex, have to care about their petty affairs? The Warden will make the choice suggested by his conscience, and what happens next is of no great importance. They may say I am predictable, but no one would ever say I am easily controlled.

If I will sacrifice my offering, that doleful woman I have summoned, then I will become one with the Kin. I will take the burden of their suffering on my shoulders and provide for them.

But if I keep the word I gave to my father and allow the offering to live, this will mean I have strayed away from the path I was chosen to follow. Not only will I reject the destiny meant for me, but also for the rest of my kin.

It is time to choose.]]></string>

<string id="530581"><![CDATA[Why would they call me a thief, pray tell?

What did I steal? Why does the Law detest me so?

The only thing I remember is that I am an outlaw, and will forever be persecuted.

Was I really that good a thief, I wonder? I have nothing of value, just myself and these rags I am wearing. My crime is horrendous, still, I am beyond redemption. Back in the day, every heart was open before me. Now, whatever door I approach is slammed in my face. This is terrifying. Where should I run? With whom shall I seek shelter? Shall I find what I stole and give it back? Who will agree to take it off my hands? 

Who will answer my questions, if not you?]]></string>

I am the Harbinger; the Judge. I am one of the twin angels. The angel of righteousness, no less, for there is no place within me where evil may hide. I will look them in the eye, I will set my hooks deep into them and pull out whatever sickness I find. I will unveil the embodiment of pestilence! 

But who was it that bestowed upon me the right to judge? Who gave me the freedom to choose who lives and who dies? 

Tell me!]]></string>
<string id="530583"><![CDATA[Tell me, why do they call me the Changeling?

Who am I, but a ragged wanderer? What is so interesting about me? Alas, it is not so simple as that. I am the key, the solution. Not the-world-in-me, but me-in-the-world.

I can perform miracles, there's no doubt of that. The Bachelor himself had to admit I am no killer; no plague carrier... But who am I then? This he did not tell.

With my own eyes, I saw my sister whom I had but slight intimations about. Now I don't know which one of us is which. I must be going insane.

Which one of the two stole the other's name; claimed her calling; seized her destiny? 

Please define me.]]></string>
<string id="530584"><![CDATA[Before today I was making rounds of the people. Now I am making rounds of the Town. My journey is over. I witnessed the seeds of righteousness within the deepest chasms of evil. I was unable to find a single place that deserved to be destroyed.

But what shall I do then? Can I bring back the victims I have condemned? Can I save the ones that died because of me? 

...Is it really within my power to perform a true miracle? 

What was the point of repeating history if everything was known in advance? What made them say that I was the only one able to escape? The key to victory, and the key to my freedom is lost on the road I have travelled. 

Here are my hands. Time to act.]]></string>
<string id="530585"><![CDATA[I am making the choice.

My past will be solidified by this decision. If I proceed with the final miracle, it will define me as a wonder-worker and a thief. If I give up, it will mean I was the embodiment of pestilence and the weapon of the Law.

But the Powers That Be... Are they not a bunch of frightened children? Why else would they be so fascinated by miracles? I thought I was the puppet. Now it seems to be the other way around.

Is this not a trap? 

Was this twist not foreseen by the Makers though? If the miracle is the way to overcome the inevitable—can a miracle be done at someone else's bidding? Is this not a trap?

What shall I do? How shall I free myself? Shall I refuse to perform miracles even though I am able? Is this not a trap... 

The clock is ticking. The initiation reaches its extremity.]]></string>

Attention all citizens! Following the outbreak of a lethal disease commonly known as "Sand Plague", "Sand Pest", and "Sand Dirt", the town authorities hereby declare state of emergency.

The disease is extremely contagious. There is still ongoing research as to how the disease is transmitted, but cases of contact and droplet infection have been confirmed. There are currently no vaccine solutions in the town and none are to be expected before the regular train arrives. Please be extra careful!

The townspeople are forbidden to leave their homes unless under special instruction. Remember: the possibility of infection is much lower for those who stay indoors. The citizens are advised to sterilise their household wares, boil their clothing, and exterminate as many vermin as possible.

Do not panic! Medics, couriers and executors will take care of mail delivery, as well as the distribution of drinking water, provisions and medicine. Requests should be written down and slid under the door for couriers to collect.

This address was composed on the instructions of Bachelor Dankovsky and ratified by the State of Emergency Town Governor Alexander Saburov. It is compulsory to follow every advice herein.]]></string>
<string id="530678"><![CDATA[EPIDEMIC ALERT]]></string>
<string id="530679"><![CDATA[The Annotation for Patrolmen, Couriers, Executors and Sanitary Personnel

In order to prevent panic, this annotation is classified and its contents should be under no circumstances disclosed to the civilian population.

The disease is incurable. There is no vaccine, neither here nor in the Capital. However, there are a few positive facts:

1. The probability of contracting the disease is significantly lower for someone who has taken immune system stimulants. As of now we believe that A-pills and B-pills (yellow coloured and blue coloured pills, respectively) provide the best protective effect. Excessive doses of these medicants may be detrimental to one's health.

2. Additional protection is afforded by synthetic clothing. Woolen garments are strictly off limits (parasites). The clothing should be changed as often as possible.

3. IMPORTANT! The disease develops sporadically. At its initial stage, it does not progress in any significant way, especially if antibiotics are taken. However, if contact with the infection reoccurs, the development of the disease becomes extremely rapid.

4. The disease is not transmitted by means of droplet infection. As of now, we've yet to find out how it is contracted. Preliminary tests suggest that the disease is not contagious at early stages, therefore there is no need to isolate the sick person immediately after the appearance of the symptoms.

App. The Executors:

In consideration of your particular line of work, we believe that you will not be able to avoid infection. If you have contracted the disease, do not give in to despair. It would have happened sooner or later anyway. Try your best to conserve the infection at its initial stage. Take antibiotic medicine. Consider using the "shmowders": they are extremely dangerous, but they help curb the infection.]]></string>

<string id="530686"><![CDATA[Abusing someone else's integrity is despicable! Despicable… And I know who's behind all that.

<string id="530691"><![CDATA[With the fact that you're a bachelor? Sure.]]></string>
<string id="530692"><![CDATA[I wanted to explain myself.]]></string>

<string id="530714"><![CDATA[...Before we can announce to the Powers That Be that the cure for the disease has been found... I meant to say announce that you've found it... it has to be tested.

<string id="530715"><![CDATA[I am.]]></string>
<string id="530716"><![CDATA[Then you'll have to get infected and wait for the... critical stage. The experiment will have to be observed, of course. Take the panacea only after you begin to fade. Then the Executors will acknowledge that it works.]]></string>
<string id="530717"><![CDATA[How shall we arrange this?]]></string>
<string id="530718"><![CDATA[I've notified the Executors that are on duty at the hospital. I think the place used to serve a different purpose before? Oh yes, the Theatre. They've been informed.

<string id="530724"><![CDATA[I see. How much time do we have?]]></string>
<string id="530725"><![CDATA[Before they get around to thinking about us? Two weeks or so... No, this town is most likely doomed. I'm talking about other towns.]]></string>
<string id="530726"><![CDATA[There are no other towns. I only care about this one.]]></string>
<string id="530728"><![CDATA[So do I! Too much, perhaps… Nevertheless, I will not neglect my duty. Will you test the medicine?]]></string>
<string id="530729"><![CDATA[I will.]]></string>
<string id="530730"><![CDATA[I can't. I'm too exhausted.]]></string>

<string id="530732"><![CDATA[Death, what else…]]></string>
<string id="530733"><![CDATA[It brings life, not death. And it is you I should thank for it.]]></string>
<string id="530734"><![CDATA[You have nothing to thank me for. And the source material you've made it from is very rare... the town will be gone long before they produce an artificial equivalent in the Capital. And I'm describing the best possible scenario here…]]></string>
<string id="530735"><![CDATA[Wait. If it weren't for you, I would never have fulfilled my duty as a son. You can't possibly imagine how much it means… to me.]]></string>
<string id="530736"><![CDATA[Definitely. Everything has a hidden meaning. Lies do not exist; and nether is it possible to invent a fantasy. Myths are always true—all you need is to find the right interpretation. As for your panacea... it will yet be of use… to all of us.]]></string>
<string id="530737"><![CDATA[I can. But don't be rash. Perhaps the panacea has nothing to do with your udurgh...]]></string>
<string id="530738"><![CDATA[Do you believe in the udurgh?]]></string>
<string id="530739"><![CDATA[I believe in you.]]></string>
<string id="530740"><![CDATA[This is not an answer. Do you believe the Sought One to be an udurgh? Do you take Steppe superstitions seriously?]]></string>
<string id="530741"><![CDATA[So Victor was right! It wasn't you who made the panacea, and now the Powers That Be will use this as an excuse to execute you, won't they?]]></string>
<string id="530742"><![CDATA[Ah, forget it... Where there's a will, there's a way... And Victor—are you talking about Victor Kain? Nina's husband? He has a keen mind. But he still loves his wife way too much... she never deserved a husband like that, and I mean it. Nor do I deserve your gratitude. What's done is done.]]></string>
<string id="530743"><![CDATA[No one will ever dare to say that the panacea was made without your help.]]></string>
<string id="530744"><![CDATA[It's a coincidence. Moreover, Dankovsky has told me all about your work—all I had to do was add the information I have to the mix. You alone deserve all the credit. Don't you ever deny your creation. You get the laurels, you get the responsibility. Your path hasn't come to an end yet. And, perhaps... neither has mine.]]></string>
<string id="530745"><![CDATA[I'll tell them it was you who made it. You led me to the man-bull hybrid.]]></string>

<string id="530748"><![CDATA[I know what this meant for you. And I won't forget it.]]></string>
<string id="530749"><![CDATA[Laughably little. The Foreman only gave me enough to hold in my cupped hands.]]></string>
<string id="530750"><![CDATA[I've been told a lot about the Abattoir... you know, the more I study this town, the more it feels like the Steppe beliefs are important. Every source needs to be spoken to in its own tongue... every source needs to be asked the questions it can answer…]]></string>
<string id="530751"><![CDATA[I agree.]]></string>
<string id="530752"><![CDATA[Inquisitorial methods?]]></string>
<string id="530753"><![CDATA[Listen, Artemy Burakh. Come back here in a while. Tomorrow, perhaps. I might have something interesting to tell you then... If we manage without their help... yes, it'll be a true miracle. Then I'll be able to return with my head held high! But now I need to think.]]></string>
<string id="530754"><![CDATA[Tell me, would you like to preserve this town?]]></string>
<string id="530755"><![CDATA[I would. I grew up here. My father is buried here. My name is respected here.]]></string>
<string id="530756"><![CDATA[Not anymore. It disgusts me now.]]></string>
<string id="530757"><![CDATA[Then our ways part here. However, if deep down you turn out to be a kinder person, I would be happy to accept your help.]]></string>
<string id="530758"><![CDATA[I'll keep that in mind.]]></string>

<string id="530760"><![CDATA[I don't know. I think I forgot to drink it...]]></string>
<string id="530761"><![CDATA[You've chosen a bad time for jokes… I think it's time for you to return to the Executors. Better yet, drink it right here. I will find someone else to test it on.]]></string>
<string id="530762"><![CDATA[No, it doesn't...]]></string>
<string id="530763"><![CDATA[You never know with you Inquisitors… You're good at hiding your true feelings.]]></string>
<string id="530764"><![CDATA[No need. I'm going back to the Theatre.]]></string>
<string id="530765"><![CDATA[I don't care.]]></string>
<string id="530766"><![CDATA[I will not doubt your words.]]></string>
<string id="530767"><![CDATA[Of all the goals I may have, saving this town is the most crucial one. I'll be honest with you—I do not love it; and I do suspect this hopeless mission is my last chance. Yet my choices have nothing to do with self-preservation; they're about integrity and ambition.]]></string>
<string id="530768"><![CDATA[I understand.]]></string>
<string id="530769"><![CDATA[The source of the disease will be found, and it will be destroyed. It's a matter of time—and it will only take a few days. The sick can be cured with your panacea. The plan is all-around great, but there's a huge hole in it. The panacea is scarce. Its main ingredient is a relic, a fossil almost; there are fewer aurochses left in this world than leviathans, as far as I can tell...]]></string>
<string id="530770"><![CDATA[That is so.]]></string>
<string id="530771"><![CDATA[They say an aurochs was brought from the Steppe the day before yesterday to be sacrificed. It's supposed to deliver us from the plague. Odonghs say it was the last one.]]></string>
<string id="530772"><![CDATA[That is so.]]></string>
<string id="530773"><![CDATA[Still, I'm confused. I've been told that only a true Warden can handle an aurochs. Is this the reason why Olgimsky manages the Kin personally, but requires a middleman in any matter that has to do with the Abattoir?]]></string>
<string id="530774"><![CDATA[An interesting conclusion… I never thought of it like this…]]></string>
<string id="530775"><![CDATA[I understand.]]></string>
<string id="530776"><![CDATA[The Foreman oversees the rituals and performs the Rite from time to time, cutting a bull in a way that has been the true way since the creation of the world—for the perpetuation of the world. That cosmic bull is an aurochs. It contains every element, every line, every tongue, every connection; everything. Have I been informed correctly?]]></string>
<string id="530777"><![CDATA[Yes, sounds about right.]]></string>
<string id="530778"><![CDATA[But the rite didn't work out. The Kin is disappointed and unhappy with the Foreman. This means he did something wrong. The Kin had been locked up in the Termitary, so I assume there were few witnesses. Could it be that the Foreman was unable to handle the aurochs? Perhaps there was no mactation at all?]]></string>
<string id="530779"><![CDATA[Where did the blood come from then?]]></string>
<string id="530780"><![CDATA[That's exactly what's bugging me. The Rite was performed the day before yesterday, so many hours must have passed since then, but you were given steaming blood. It was full of oxygen, it was alive—as if it had just been extracted from a living body.]]></string>
<string id="530781"><![CDATA[Speak.]]></string>
<string id="530782"><![CDATA[Yes, my father used to say the same thing.]]></string>
<string id="530783"><![CDATA[That is true.]]></string>
<string id="530784"><![CDATA[Ask the Foreman where the blood came from. I think the Abattoir hides many secrets... and you are the only person that can get into its depths. The further we go, the more convinced I become that we're on the right path. Even in our enlightened times, we are to be saved by the legends of ancient herdsmen.]]></string>
<string id="530787"><![CDATA[Why is it hopeless?]]></string>
<string id="530788"><![CDATA[Not for me; but I think they deem it hopeless. This town is little more than a grave they can throw anything into and watch it rot. I do have a suspicion that it's precious to them though… Yet they wouldn't have sent an artillery squad here… unless they had other towns to have fun with.]]></string>
<string id="530789"><![CDATA[What are you planning to do?]]></string>
<string id="530790"><![CDATA[I don't even know if they'll let me in.]]></string>
<string id="530791"><![CDATA[Oh, they will—after what happened yesterday. The Foreman is interested in you now. He is also frightened of you.]]></string>
<string id="530792"><![CDATA[How do you know?]]></string>
<string id="530793"><![CDATA[He sent a messenger to seek Olgimsky's advice. They held a meeting. I've interrogated Vlad, and he said that the Foreman is very frightened. Basically, you've made a big commotion. See? I'm being completely honest with you.]]></string>
<string id="530794"><![CDATA[If he is frightened, what's to stop him from closing the Abattoir and waiting for me to meet my death here?]]></string>
<string id="530795"><![CDATA[Try to get in there through the Termitary then. Taya Tycheek can open the way to the Abattoir. That girl is something else. Keep a close eye on her.]]></string>
<string id="530796"><![CDATA[I will follow your bold advice.]]></string>
<string id="530797"><![CDATA[Good luck to you, Artemy Burakh. Beware of the Foreman. He's afraid of you, but he is the kind of man whose fear is more dangerous than his calm.]]></string>
<string id="530798"><![CDATA[What if the Abattoir is closed?]]></string>
<string id="530799"><![CDATA[Then get in there through the Termitary. I talked to this girl, Taya Tycheek, yesterday. Her power is incredible. She even made me doubt if I can make her obey my will. She knows how to open the Abattoir.]]></string>
<string id="530800"><![CDATA[Tsk, tsk.. I don't think anyone has ever dared call me "woman".]]></string>

I'm too dangerous when I'm sober... I ought to keep my mind chained. That is because I am Peter Stamatin, an architect of His Imperial Highness!]]></string>

<string id="530819"><![CDATA[My intuition tells me that there should be some kind of liquid, like boiling water or spirit, in the big container. The tissue itself is put somewhere lower. It's probably stewed there... or something like that.]]></string>
<string id="530820"><![CDATA[What of the other devices?]]></string>
<string id="530821"><![CDATA[So what about Clara?]]></string>
<string id="530822"><![CDATA[She is swooping at my children. She is definitely up to no good.]]></string>
<string id="530823"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="530824"><![CDATA[There is a whole system of underground tunnels beneath the town, up to the Gorkhon river. Sacrificial blood has been poured down there for hundreds of years.]]></string>
<string id="530825"><![CDATA[No surprise there. I've read about it when I was preparing for the trip. Furthermore, I know for sure that other peoples have similar cults. They all belong to different ethnic groups—some of them are northerners.]]></string>
<string id="530826"><![CDATA[The blood there is alive. That means the town nourishes it—and it probably nourishes the town. That's inexplicable—but it's a fact. Well? Is it consistent with your data and calculations?]]></string>
<string id="530827"><![CDATA[I am simply interpreting Isidor's words. Here, I've written it down: he knew that said udurgh was in danger. He knew that only a miracle could save its life. He knew that in order to cure it, one would require rivers of panacea. And so he decided to replace the Foreman and regain legitimate control over the Kin to get closer to the... udurgh's bowels.]]></string>
<string id="530828"><![CDATA[You are correct... Yes. It's true.]]></string>
<string id="530829"><![CDATA[Well, I have a different point of view, but I think I'm reconstructing Isidor's thought process more or less correctly. The sign refers to some unnamed entity. It was silly of him to include this... superbeing in his list among ordinary patients. It must have been boggling his mind, too.]]></string>
<string id="530830"><![CDATA[…Well I'll be… It is consistent with the calculations. As for the data… well, it also is. This is why digging wells is prohibited around here. This is why the rivers are so shallow and the Gorkhon is so clean. Yes. I'm impressed, but not shocked. I was prepared to encounter something unique… even though I expected the mundane.]]></string>
<string id="530831"><![CDATA[How do you explain this?]]></string>
<string id="530832"><![CDATA[Wait a moment... this may be a rather fascinating natural phenomenon, but you should look at it from a different angle. If there is blood circulating in the town, feeding it, then it's alive. This is your Sought One. It all clicks, doesn't it? At least the size is fitting. What does "udurgh" mean?]]></string>
<string id="530833"><![CDATA["A body that contains the world."]]></string>
<string id="530834"><![CDATA[What were you expecting?]]></string>
<string id="530838"><![CDATA[Something way less exciting. I thought the Foreman was hiding an aurochs somewhere—a wounded one, perhaps... They could have drawn some of its blood for you. One aurochs would allow us to produce a few thousands of portions at least—enough for the remaining people. I've heard they are gigantic. Almost comparable to brontosauri.]]></string>
<string id="530839"><![CDATA[To what?]]></string>
<string id="530840"><![CDATA[That's just nonsense!]]></string>
<string id="530841"><![CDATA[Artemy, I want us to sort this out once and for all—and never bring up the subject again. I'm not an Inquisitor for you. It seems that fate wants it this way. You are not allowed to request such things of me. It would be... an abuse of my trust. An offence against my integrity and my duty.]]></string>
<string id="530842"><![CDATA[But still…]]></string>
<string id="530843"><![CDATA[I am only interested in having a personal relationship with you for now. I don't want you to indulge in politics until your status is comparable to mine. I have enough aids and advisors.]]></string>

<string id="530845"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="530846"><![CDATA[Okay. Got it.]]></string>
<string id="530847"><![CDATA[I understand.]]></string>
<string id="530848"><![CDATA[I know all the facts. I have more than twelve thousand facts concerning this town's case at my disposal. I will deal with the rulers myself—as an official emissary... and you should take your place, the place that lies outside the scope of authority of the Powers That Be... to say nothing of mine.]]></string>

Regardless of what libel the Bachelor is spreading about me, I am simply too afraid to plot any manner of mischief. There is a lot going on right now. This terrifying child... this angel of death has descended to my humble abode. She won't leave. I think she is hiding somewhere in the house at this very moment.

The healing saint doesn't look as saintly as she used to. Not a Supreme Judge, but rather the opposite. She is exhausted, ragged, and worn out, her clothes are soaking wet as though she has been crying for a week. If this is you she is trying to hide from—then come and take her. I will hold her, at least until the evening.

Yours as may be,

<string id="531099"><![CDATA[Well... I'm not just some bloke, as it turns out! Got a place in Capella's master plan, see? I'll start taking things on when she turns into the White Mistress. First I'll become the head of intelligence, but then… oh man!]]></string>

<string id="531125"><![CDATA[The Olgimsky girl? Curious. I had a feeling she might make a move. Sooner or later our paths had to cross… So what is she up to?]]></string>

<string id="531127"><![CDATA[So goes the world. Capella is smarter than me, but she is nothing without military support. ]]></string>
<string id="531128"><![CDATA[Time will tell, Kain.]]></string>
<string id="531129"><![CDATA[You have Khan's consent. It didn't take him long.]]></string>
<string id="531130"><![CDATA[That means he will leave the Tower tomorrow or the day after tomorrow—and so will his minions. You know how to make a lot of panacea already, don't you?]]></string>

<string id="531145"><![CDATA["Who is Going to Feed the Dolly?"]]></string>
<string id="531146"><![CDATA[Murky is worried; she wants to get outside. What could have possibly made her this agitated?]]></string>
<string id="531147"><![CDATA[The doll is fed by one of the "bull barrows". Father said that these stones were here long before the first cattle-breeders arrived. The stones were used for some ritual needs and the bones that lay beneath make them easy to see.]]></string>
<string id="531148"><![CDATA[It seems that this horrible freak of nature is none other than Murky's precious dolly. She looks well-fed. I may return.]]></string>
<string id="531149"><![CDATA["The Spirit Will Bow Before the Power"]]></string>
<string id="531150"><![CDATA[The Bachelor knows how to get inside this wretched Tower. He has been to the very bowels of it... which is something I do not require. I only need to go as far as the threshold.]]></string>
<string id="531151"><![CDATA[The Kains are plotting something. They are a large family, and each one of them wants to live by their own will. It seems that both Capella and the Bachelor know of the intrigue these power games entail, whereas I don't give a damn.]]></string>
<string id="531152"><![CDATA[Kaspar Kain doesn't look a pleasant fellow. I wonder what this hero will be like in ten years time... He has potential, but it suggests he should be held on a short leash. I can go back to Capella now.]]></string>
<string id="531153"><![CDATA[*** So, the matchmaking was a success. Capella has moved the final figure on the board. A sad move... She was clearly trying to pick the lesser of two evils. It's strange how calm and collected the lad was. As if he always knew what was going to happen.]]></string>
<string id="531154"><![CDATA[Would you do me another favour? There is more bad news. I'm not surprised anymore. Every crucial person will have to face a dangerous trial now.]]></string>
<string id="531155"><![CDATA[Why do you care for this Murky anyway?]]></string>
<string id="531156"><![CDATA[When Murky grows up, she'll replace Saburova. She knows how to listen to the soil, and so she'll make a good Mistress of Earth—and the Rat Prophet's dirt-piling services will not be required anymore. Murky is clean.]]></string>
<string id="531157"><![CDATA[Ok, I'll stop by at her place.]]></string>
<string id="531158"><![CDATA[I've got other things to do.]]></string>
<string id="531159"><![CDATA[Okay, I'll check on Murky.]]></string>
<string id="531160"><![CDATA[I think it could benefit you too. Our paths are intertwined—and Murky guards the paths that hold a lot of exciting things.]]></string>
<string id="531161"><![CDATA[...I have no idea.]]></string>
<string id="531162"><![CDATA[Is that you? But she didn't come back...]]></string>
<string id="531163"><![CDATA[What does she eat?]]></string>
<string id="531164"><![CDATA[What is that doll to you anyway?]]></string>
<string id="531165"><![CDATA[No, she left on her own. She was hungry!]]></string>
<string id="531166"><![CDATA[Where did she go?]]></string>
<string id="531167"><![CDATA[She eats herbs that grow by the bull burial grounds. You know those? They have bullhead stones.]]></string>
<string id="531168"><![CDATA[Mommy and daddy left her to me. She is the one listening to the Earth. Personally, I can hear almost nothing. She tells me everything. She's nice...]]></string>
<string id="531169"><![CDATA[So which stone is she by?]]></string>
<string id="531170"><![CDATA[No one knows for sure, but there were Worms there. Worms mean herbs.]]></string>
<string id="531171"><![CDATA[Stay here. I'll bring you the doll.]]></string>
<string id="531172"><![CDATA[Is this your doll?]]></string>
<string id="531173"><![CDATA[Here. Take this. It's not just a flask. There's blood in it. You know how to make medicine from it, don't you? Well, make some for yourself. Don't worry, it's no one's.]]></string>
<string id="531174"><![CDATA[Where did you get this?]]></string>
<string id="531175"><![CDATA[I got it from a puddle near the Tower when I went looking for my doll. There's probably a whole lake there by now. The Earth is all damp. I felt it. I thought my doll could have gone to drink it.]]></string>
<string id="531176"><![CDATA[No way…]]></string>
<string id="531177"><![CDATA[There's more where this came from. Go take a look.]]></string>
<string id="531178"><![CDATA[If this is true, then I'll come back and ask you a few questions, so you stay here.]]></string>
<string id="531179"><![CDATA[You're right. There is blood over there. What does this mean?]]></string>
<string id="531180"><![CDATA[I don't know. It happens from time to time. When we lived in the Tower, we used to think it was a bad omen. We began playing "Marsh" or "Coverlet" immediately.]]></string>
<string id="531181"><![CDATA[It seems all the answers are there...]]></string>
<string id="531182"><![CDATA[Blood is emerging from beneath the Children's Tower? But where did it come from? Was this blood spilled within the Tower? It makes me wonder who resides there...]]></string>
<string id="531183"><![CDATA[Murky was telling the truth. This is amazing; the blood doesn't appear to be human... Nor does it seem to be leaking from inside the Tower... I should ask Murky if she knows anything else about this.]]></string>
<string id="531184"><![CDATA[*** The story suggests a number of different conclusions... But something tells me this is not the time to jump to any of them. As the good old Bachelor would say: "Let us just make note of the facts."]]></string>
<string id="531185"><![CDATA[You are the mistress of the house. I'll speak to your guest first if you want.]]></string>
<string id="531186"><![CDATA[Is that so?]]></string>
<string id="531187"><![CDATA[The soldiers are all over the place now. They won't risk staying in town for too long, but will rather return to the Polyhedron. I'm so thankful to you for helping Sticky out! You have my gratitude, Warden.]]></string>
<string id="531188"><![CDATA[And who are these "parts of your design"?]]></string>
<string id="531189"><![CDATA[Several kids. I told you before—and your father before that. The outcast children. Those who didn't fit in the Polyhedron and those who have left it willingly. Taya Tycheek, Notkin, Sticky, Murky, Grace. And… one more boy, but we'll talk about him later.]]></string>
<string id="531190"><![CDATA[What do they have to do with the fires?]]></string>
<string id="531191"><![CDATA[The fires were put out! I don't really care about the fires themselves—in fact, I'm glad they're out. They made me feel terrified—and made the Town look truly doomed. Sticky is risking his life because of them now... What are they for anyway?]]></string>
<string id="531192"><![CDATA[Why do you need these kids?]]></string>
<string id="531193"><![CDATA[Your trust is touching. What's the matter?]]></string>
<string id="531194"><![CDATA[What do you think each one of them will grow to be? Can you guess? I can—Mother has whispered the truth to me in my sleep. The outcast children are destined to achieve great things. If in ten or twelve years they become Rulers… the Town will change beyond recognition! A new age will begin.]]></string>
<string id="531195"><![CDATA[A pie in the sky... I don't believe in it. Sorry.]]></string>
<string id="531196"><![CDATA[I see. So why did you call me?]]></string>
<string id="531197"><![CDATA[How is he risking his life?]]></string>
<string id="531198"><![CDATA[What for?]]></string>
<string id="531199"><![CDATA[Sticky is a brave boy. He thinks the Albino has something to do with the plague. He also knows the Albino is always following the same route. And Aglaya… shhh… ordered the fires to be lit just by that path. Oh, it's merely his way of putting his bravery to the test!]]></string>
<string id="531200"><![CDATA[Oh... And where is he lighting them up?]]></string>
<string id="531201"><![CDATA[Well, if he's so brave, he'll deal with it just fine on his own. And you should be thinking about your future.]]></string>
<string id="531202"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="531203"><![CDATA[Eh... I can't tell you yet. Don't count your chickens before they're hatched. Ever heard that saying?]]></string>
<string id="531204"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="531205"><![CDATA[Well, these are the words of an adult.]]></string>
<string id="531206"><![CDATA[…Distance lends enchantment.]]></string>
<string id="531207"><![CDATA[I have. Saw a bunch of chickens. Why are they so scared?]]></string>
<string id="531208"><![CDATA[Who knows... They're all taken up with their war. Maybe they plan to attack the army train? Khan must be going nuts for the cannons. He can see what is staring the Polyhedron in the face now. And he'd rather let himself be flayed than abandon the Tower…]]></string>
<string id="531209"><![CDATA[Come off it!]]></string>
<string id="531210"><![CDATA[Isn't he a little to young for this?]]></string>
<string id="531211"><![CDATA[Kain? Come on... No Kain is a trifle, pal. He's not too young.]]></string>
<string id="531212"><![CDATA[They say he's knee-high.]]></string>
<string id="531213"><![CDATA[Got it.]]></string>
<string id="531214"><![CDATA[Stay. There will be exploits to witness.]]></string>
<string id="531215"><![CDATA[Don't. We'll be better off without you.]]></string>
<string id="531216"><![CDATA[Really? What if you're wrong though? Take the money. I give you what is due. The shop that will accept any goods at a high price is in the Stone Yard. Skirt The Crucible, walk towards the tombs, and you'll see a inconspicuous sign. Good luck.]]></string>
<string id="531217"><![CDATA[The new. I've found something in my father's inheritance.]]></string>
<string id="531218"><![CDATA[So? Are you saying that you're planning to brew new types of twyrine?]]></string>
<string id="531219"><![CDATA[Very likely.]]></string>
<string id="531220"><![CDATA[Well, it's worth staying then. At least we'll see if you manage anything.]]></string>
<string id="531221"><![CDATA[Nah... I haven't found anything new.]]></string>
<string id="531222"><![CDATA[You aren't likely to get any.]]></string>
<string id="531224"><![CDATA[By the way, what did you gossip with Maria about, tough guy?]]></string>
<string id="531225"><![CDATA[That's absolutely not your business.]]></string>
<string id="531226"><![CDATA[She wanted me to make you two stay here for a while.]]></string>
<string id="531227"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="531228"><![CDATA[I have money. Tons of it. Four thousand in local currency. I want a mere nothing for it. I need brown twyre. Ten blades, no less. Straight, clean ones. No flaws. No colour. Preferably named... but that's optional. Brown twyre will yield to you, you are a menkhu. Deal?]]></string>
<string id="531229"><![CDATA[Why can't you buy it yourself?]]></string>
<string id="531230"><![CDATA[I had a... quarrel with the Worms. My dark game has been revealed... they basically went off and started killing each other for revealing their tribal secrets. I'm no longer trusted.]]></string>
<string id="531231"><![CDATA[So why don't you just get down to business then?]]></string>
<string id="531232"><![CDATA[I don't need this. I'm a closed chapter already. I'll just grab my little brother—and to hell with everything else. We'll be all right.]]></string>
<string id="531233"><![CDATA[What about the money? You'll just give it to me?]]></string>
<string id="531234"><![CDATA[Well, don't let the door hit you on your way out.]]></string>
<string id="531235"><![CDATA[No way. Go to hell!]]></string>
<string id="531236"><![CDATA[What shop?]]></string>
<string id="531237"><![CDATA[Not so fast. Like I said, my sources are reliable. Victor won't let us down either. It's all cut and dried with the Kains... they've got no time for mercantile matters anyway. So overprice away. Well? What do you say? Huh?]]></string>
<string id="531238"><![CDATA[I don't get it. And how am I supposed to make a fortune by the evening?]]></string>
<string id="531239"><![CDATA[You don't get it? With my money you'll be able to buy a whole load of goods and resell them for three times as much... at a certain shop. I've got good sources.]]></string>
<string id="531240"><![CDATA[So what's in it for me?]]></string>
<string id="531241"><![CDATA[I can imagine.]]></string>
<string id="531242"><![CDATA[It's okay. Feast your eyes on it.]]></string>
<string id="531243"><![CDATA[Why don't you do it yourself?]]></string>
<string id="531244"><![CDATA[Are you laughing at me? The herb doesn't yield to us. Tried it many a time. It conceals itself from strangers. I also used to think it was a legend or a myth or something, but... Ah, why am I explaining it to you of all people?!]]></string>
<string id="531245"><![CDATA[You are correct though.]]></string>
<string id="531246"><![CDATA[It's a myth.]]></string>
<string id="531247"><![CDATA[Of course I do. Your name is Burakh. Your visit hardly qualifies as a surprise. I am Yulia Lyuricheva, or Yulia, for simplicity. Do you have any serious aversion to cigarette smoke?]]></string>
<string id="531248"><![CDATA[It's all right. I got used to it when I was a student.]]></string>
<string id="531249"><![CDATA[It doesn't bother me.]]></string>
<string id="531250"><![CDATA[Indeed. You don't have the look of a man who is bothered so easily. And you don't seem to be too inclined to keep things tidy either.]]></string>
<string id="531251"><![CDATA[That depends. Shall we get acquainted?]]></string>
<string id="531252"><![CDATA[I can't stand it.]]></string>
<string id="531253"><![CDATA[Doesn't matter. I've noticed you were headed for the architects. Are you the man they asked to gather rare herbs for them before they hit the road?]]></string>
<string id="531254"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="531255"><![CDATA[That's not how you're supposed to address me. I am a menkhu.]]></string>

<string id="531259"><![CDATA[Damn! Missed it…]]></string>
<string id="531260"><![CDATA[*** I don't think that Tycheek's daughter was convinced by the story I told her. She is in a thoughtful mood; she seems to have forgotten about the bulls for now...]]></string>
<string id="531261"><![CDATA[Murky is just about to leave her van.]]></string>
<string id="531262"><![CDATA[Could be somewhere around here… At least, there's something to eat there.]]></string>
<string id="531263"><![CDATA[MURKY'S TOY. A remarkably ugly specimen. With pets like this, no wonder the girl is growing up gloomy and aloof.]]></string>
<string id="531264"><![CDATA[What are you, an odongh? How did you manage to avoid the massacre then? I thought all of you were killed by the zealots three days ago, and the rest were locked up in the Termitary yesterday.]]></string>
<string id="531265"><![CDATA[I come from a menkhu family.]]></string>
<string id="531266"><![CDATA[Hush! Quiet... Listen to me, olgoy. The architects are planning to leave our town. I want them to stay. Tell Andrey you've managed to discover the secrets of old Isidor's brews. They're quite sought-after now—rumour has it, Saburov has seized Isidor's belongings.]]></string>
<string id="531267"><![CDATA[I was promised money for this, actually.]]></string>
<string id="531268"><![CDATA[I'll give you one of the recipes if Andrey demands proof. It costs a fortune, but I'm prepared to go to great expences for a deal like this. I'll also reimburse any lost profits to you, of course. You must be aware that I come from a rather wealthy family. Well? Deal?]]></string>
<string id="531269"><![CDATA[Are girls with good backgrounds really supposed visit places like this?]]></string>
<string id="531270"><![CDATA[No. You're confusing me with someone else, woman.]]></string>

<string id="531272"><![CDATA[But they can see us two whispering.]]></string>
<string id="531273"><![CDATA[That's a ridiculous idea. Just look at them, their eyes are fixed on us. No.]]></string>
<string id="531274"><![CDATA[Do you two come from the Capital?]]></string>
<string id="531275"><![CDATA[Yes. I am, you know... when we were invited here—that was ten year ago... twyrine was unheard of in the Capital back then. I came here for it. So fetch us more herbs, gatherer, will you!]]></string>
<string id="531276"><![CDATA[Who is it this time?]]></string>
<string id="531277"><![CDATA[This time Clara came to Murky—and now Murky wants to go outside! Clara did something bad to her. Murky is anxious now, I can feel it.]]></string>
<string id="531278"><![CDATA[What happened?]]></string>
<string id="531279"><![CDATA[I don't know! Nothing at all, perhaps. All I know is Murky is very anxious. And she's not the type of girl to be easily scared by fairy-tales… you'll be the one scared of hers.]]></string>
<string id="531280"><![CDATA[Seems like she can take care of this herself.]]></string>

<string id="531282"><![CDATA[Of course I will.]]></string>
<string id="531283"><![CDATA[What would you do?]]></string>
<string id="531284"><![CDATA[As if they have dwindled since yesterday.]]></string>
<string id="531285"><![CDATA[They have. Many of them got infected the day before… And Block made them distrubite their pills among the local population. Khan and the Bachelor also helped throw them out of balance. So there's that.]]></string>
<string id="531286"><![CDATA[My hands aren't as strong as yours, but I can be dangerous, Burakh. I am a Mistress, don't you ever forget that. I know how to stand up for myself and I can make a criminal regret their actions.]]></string>
<string id="531287"><![CDATA[So where is the girl?]]></string>
<string id="531288"><![CDATA[Perhaps the Commander can issue an order to let her go. Where do the military keep their prisoners? It must be in the Town Hall.]]></string>

<string id="531299"><![CDATA[Yeah, but what do you think? Personally?]]></string>
<string id="531300"><![CDATA[I think the Abattoir people may know what it is. All blood flows from there. They even make blood pudding there. And we aren't allowed to even think about the Abattoir. There.]]></string>

<string id="531529"><![CDATA[And what does Capella think?]]></string>
<string id="531530"><![CDATA[You wouldn't understand, oynon.]]></string>

<string id="531532"><![CDATA[Is Capella a Mistress already? Although... it doesn't matter, it's of no importance at all. So, what's the answer? Can Simon be the udurgh? Is that even in the realm of possibility?]]></string>
<string id="531533"><![CDATA[Yes, he can. You seem to be right, oynon.]]></string>
<string id="531534"><![CDATA[Well... Then the game is worth the candle. Even though it's going to be risky, I'll have to put my reputation at stake and triumph over the dreadful champion of the Skerries.]]></string>
<string id="531535"><![CDATA[Please note that I'm not forcing the decision down your throat. I, myself, will keep going over this, thinking and rethinking. I only want to use your special case as an... additional argument, I think? It fills the empty spaces in my musings... just like that stone with ancient writings in three languages.]]></string>

<string id="531565"><![CDATA[Long time no see..... friend.]]></string>
<string id="531566"><![CDATA[Most venerable doctor! It is with great impatience that we have been expecting you. You need not delve into the minutiae of your business with us since our family is well acquainted with your scholarly work. We are also quite aware of the difficulties you were experiencing and well-prepared to do our utmost to support you. It hurts me all the more to be the one to inform you that Simon, my consanguineous brother, the creator, keeper and embodiment of all that surrounds us, has been murdered.]]></string>
<string id="531567"><![CDATA[I can't believe it.....It cannot be!]]></string>
<string id="531568"><![CDATA[My brother was murdered last night, under the strangest of circumstances. But, for all the mystery surrounding his death, I'd rather eschew the notion that his... departure was connected with whoever had visited Simon that evening. The visitor is a man of laudable rectitude and an old friend of our family. There are witnesses to testify that he and Simon did nothing but converse.]]></string>
<string id="531569"><![CDATA[Who was the visitor?]]></string>
<string id="531570"><![CDATA[Someone you know quite well. The man whom my brother saw last night was your colleague, Isidor Burakh. Was he not the the very person to advise you come here as well?]]></string>
<string id="531571"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="531572"><![CDATA[Hmm... Isidor has done more than he thinks... I have a lingering feeling that time itself is using uncontestable powers to further its own intentions. What do you think?]]></string>
<string id="531573"><![CDATA[I'm no fatalist.]]></string>
<string id="531574"><![CDATA[It could be that my mind is clouded by sorrow, but I cannot escape the feeling that your arrival was no coincidence. Your choice was made for you, my dear doctor! Let us not blame... fate for it. Isidor wrote to you without making us aware. He took a risk that could have displeased our family.]]></string>
<string id="531575"><![CDATA[Really?]]></string>
<string id="531576"><![CDATA[Even though we were uncertain of when you would arrive, my brother was looking forward to meeting you! The tragedy may have been a consequence of the actions he took in preparation for your arrival. Someone has taken a powerful piece from the chessboard; a piece upon which your position here depended. It is doubly regrettable that Simon was playing on your side...]]></string>
<string id="531577"><![CDATA[So you presume the queen knew of the blow and sacrificed itself for a pawn? But why?]]></string>
<string id="531578"><![CDATA[To grant you victory over death! Was it not your ultimate aspiration? To help you, Simon seems to have played a very dangerous game with... fate itself. He went out of his way to provide you with a body of evidence.]]></string>
<string id="531579"><![CDATA[What did he do?]]></string>
<string id="531580"><![CDATA[It is of no importance to me what exactly he did. He took another leap for the stars and paid a terrible price for it. I repeat: he was murdered. The subject of importance here is the identity of the murderer.]]></string>
<string id="531581"><![CDATA[Everything has gone to rack and ruin... I wish I could take vengeance upon the person who ripped the life from this man.]]></string>
<string id="531582"><![CDATA[Do you want to help us, doctor? Find the murderer for us. My brother Victor, who is in the wing next door, would share some of his thoughts on the matter. Help us and the reward will not disappoint you.]]></string>
<string id="531583"><![CDATA[Indeed. It seems there are too many coincidences. Your brother's murder can just as well be called the murder of Bachelor Dankovsky. I will help you in every way I can.]]></string>
<string id="531584"><![CDATA[We will take our own measures. The only thing I expect from you is to be yourself. Do only what you think is required. Whatever you find out; whatever you do; whatever your day turns into; everything is a clue to the solution of this puzzle. I repeat: everything that is happening here is happening on your account.]]></string>
<string id="531585"><![CDATA[Fine. I'm fine with this course of action.]]></string>
<string id="531586"><![CDATA[You have my sympathy.]]></string>
<string id="531587"><![CDATA[I need some time to get my act together. I suspect you are not aware that these developments render my whole lifework null and void?]]></string>
<string id="531588"><![CDATA[If that is indeed so, I feel obliged.]]></string>
<string id="531589"><![CDATA[My sincerest condolences to you. Is there anything I can do to help?]]></string>
<string id="531590"><![CDATA[Why do you speak the word "fate" with such disgust?]]></string>
<string id="531591"><![CDATA[I prefer the word "time". In a fatalistic sense of the notion, of course.]]></string>
<string id="531592"><![CDATA[So Simon wasn't aware I would come?]]></string>
<string id="531593"><![CDATA[Categories like "time", "nature", and "fate" deprive man of responsibility for what goes on around him. I was taught to avoid this worldview.]]></string>
<string id="531594"><![CDATA[I would have told you that I'd been brought here by the hand of fate not so long ago, a naïve man that I was…]]></string>
<string id="531595"><![CDATA[Has it occurred to you that your brother could have died a natural death?]]></string>
<string id="531596"><![CDATA[It won't be easy for you to accept it as fact, but this fact is not subject to debate. My brother could under no circumstances have died a natural death.]]></string>
<string id="531597"><![CDATA[Hmm...]]></string>
<string id="531598"><![CDATA[I'd rather not waste our time explaining the entire situation to you, even if it helps me substantiate the claims that you are justified to see as extraordinary. My dear doctor! I cannot imagine what kind of infernal aptitude the killer of Simon Kain must have. But Simon could not have died a natural death, so murder is the only feasible explanation.]]></string>
<string id="531599"><![CDATA[I do not doubt that your brother could fight death like no other, but there was not and could not be an immortal man!]]></string>
<string id="531600"><![CDATA[The physiological paradox is obvious, I grant you, and I am not going to try persuading you otherwise. I am not a strong player in the field of academic debate. But I repeat: under no circumstances could my brother die a natural death. Immortality is the greatest secret humanity is forbidden to posses. Still, my brother managed to break the seal that locked it away from everyone else.]]></string>
<string id="531601"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="531602"><![CDATA[I will tell you who my brother was, and who he has become, if you find his murderer. For now, let me bring up the fact that Simon lived one hundred and fifty seven years without being susceptible to any kind of disease—no influenza, no pneumonia, no haemorrhage, no organ failures or malignant growths have ever plagued him.]]></string>
<string id="531603"><![CDATA[Yes. I believe in that. I came here to witness the possibility of such a phenomenon; but immortality...]]></string>
<string id="531604"><![CDATA[To find the murderer? An unusual request... Or was it my colleague Isidor that recommended me as a skilled investigator?]]></string>
<string id="531605"><![CDATA[Well, fine! In any case, I came here to see a mystery, not a person. I am willing to sell my soul to you if you help me reveal it. How can I help?]]></string>
<string id="531606"><![CDATA[What kind of help do you expect from me?]]></string>
<string id="531607"><![CDATA[And you are implying that you can prove that?]]></string>
<string id="531608"><![CDATA[Dammit! Why did it have to happen just before I arrived? Right as I found the chance to prevail…]]></string>
<string id="531609"><![CDATA[Precisely. Why did it have to happen just before your arrival? Are you asking yourself this same question?]]></string>
<string id="531610"><![CDATA[I hope you don't see any connection between my arrival and the murder.]]></string>
<string id="531611"><![CDATA[In fact, I do see a connection. However, do not mistake it for a thought that it was you who murdered him.]]></string>
<string id="531612"><![CDATA[What do you know?]]></string>
<string id="531613"><![CDATA[Well, at least that's something…]]></string>
<string id="531614"><![CDATA[Who did it?]]></string>
<string id="531615"><![CDATA[That is what we want to find out. With your help, Bachelor Dankovsky.]]></string>
<string id="531616"><![CDATA[What do you know?]]></string>
<string id="531617"><![CDATA[Who could possibly benefit from Simon's death?]]></string>
<string id="531618"><![CDATA[No one. That's the problem. Simon had no enemies. However, my brother Victor can shed some light on certain grim circumstances that have to do... How shall I put this…? With some preternatural relationship my brother shared with several people. ]]></string>
<string id="531619"><![CDATA[I need no reward. This situation is my direct concern. I want to uncover the truth and I am willing to begin an investigation.]]></string>
<string id="531620"><![CDATA[How many doctors are there in your town?]]></string>
<string id="531621"><![CDATA[If we exclude Isidor Burakh, Stanislav Rubin is the only doctor here. He's the most competent of Isidor's apprentices. The rest are good for nothing, as far as I can tell, they're only capable of distorting the knowledge their teacher is trying to pass to them…]]></string>
<string id="531622"><![CDATA[I'd like to speak to Isidor Burakh first and foremost.]]></string>
<string id="531623"><![CDATA[Well... that is a reasonable thing to do. Moreover, that is what etiquette demands. After all, it was he that invited you here. However, I don't think he has informed anyone in The Crucible of these plans. I hope you don't get me wrong. You are our guest and we welcome you.]]></string>
<string id="531624"><![CDATA[Where does Isidor live?]]></string>
<string id="531625"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="531626"><![CDATA[Do you have any relevant experience? Do you know how a murderer may be found?]]></string>
<string id="531627"><![CDATA[Not really. But I hunt the killer of all killers in my laboratory.]]></string>
<string id="531630"><![CDATA[Incidentally, it is more than possible that the killer is hiding in the house of Anna Angel; a thespian of sorts. Now, here is another woman worthy of attention. In fact, I heard some ghastly man covered in blood was seen entering her house today.]]></string>
<string id="531631"><![CDATA[How do you know this?]]></string>
<string id="531632"><![CDATA[The town is a small place, Bachelor. The wind carries rumours with falling leaves; mixing birds' feathers with emotions. We all know one another so well here that we are sometimes able to hear each other's thoughts. A family trait, if you will. But that being said, I doubt that the man in Anna's house is the real killer.]]></string>
<string id="531633"><![CDATA[Where does this Anna live?]]></string>
<string id="531634"><![CDATA[She lives in a mansion that once belonged to a family of exiles whose political views led them to a far out town like ours. Because of some ill-conceived sense of camaraderie they were happy to give shelter to a runaway actress—as soon as she told them she was persecuted by the Powers That Be. A few years later, they died—suspiciously if you ask me—leaving Willow Mellow, their daughter, in the care of their companion. Willow died soon thereafter.]]></string>
<string id="531635"><![CDATA[Anna, huh... Well, I'll get to know her!]]></string>
<string id="531639"><![CDATA[No, I won't go there. I'm inclined to think that her visitor is another victim rather than the killer; and even that is unlikely.]]></string>
<string id="531647"><![CDATA[What kind of woman is this Anna Angel?]]></string>
<string id="531653"><![CDATA[Looking for killers is the duty of law enforcement officers. I am only willing to assist them in any way I can.]]></string>
<string id="531654"><![CDATA[I don't do killer-hunting. I'm a scientist.]]></string>
<string id="531655"><![CDATA[So, you have travelled all the way here only to find that both people you wanted to see were brutally murdered? Is this how the story goes? I do hope that your visit is not in any way related to these most unfortunate circumstances...]]></string>
<string id="531656"><![CDATA[Not quite, but in any case I hope that getting to know me will not become a problem to you.]]></string>
<string id="531678"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="531679"><![CDATA[A foul murder occurred here this night. No unauthorized access allowed. Inspecting the crime scene is strictly forbidden until further notice.]]></string>
<string id="531680"><![CDATA[You should have said so from the start.]]></string>
<string id="531681"><![CDATA[Look, this is no place for you to be, sir. Could you kindly leave? Eh? The place is villanous, and times are rough… what if some thug or cutthroat comes after you? I can't protect everyone…]]></string>

<string id="531685"><![CDATA[I was actually invited by Isidor, so I came to meet with him first and foremost. But now it turns out that…]]></string>
<string id="531686"><![CDATA[There are very few good analysts in our town. Everyone is more or less superstituous here. Except for one Yulia Lyuricheva, perhaps; a most level-headed and reasonable person; the only person to remain sceptical about Katerina's talents, too. Without a shadow of a doubt, she has her own picture of events. She always does...]]></string>
<string id="531687"><![CDATA[Very well, I'll speak to this Yulia.]]></string>
<string id="531688"><![CDATA[Nothing. Not anymore.]]></string>
<string id="531689"><![CDATA[Do you have any weapons?]]></string>
<string id="531690"><![CDATA[They're going to lynch a woman, I think. There's this superstition circulating among the people—a myth of a maneater from the Steppe, a creature called a shabnak-adyr. Supposedly it can only take female form even though it's made up of all sorts of filth… Where are my patrolmen though?]]></string>
<string id="531691"><![CDATA[Where is this lot?]]></string>
<string id="531692"><![CDATA[I've yet to meet anyone who can help me in the slightest way to find the killer...]]></string>
<string id="531693"><![CDATA[I have to find whoever it is that killed Isidor and Simon, and I wanted to ask for your help. Saburov told me you have a gift for all manner of investigative inquiry.]]></string>

<string id="531696"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="531697"><![CDATA[You have been sent to a ruler... and this is where you came... that's flattering. Simon, however, comes from a different family. The Kains are waiting for you.]]></string>
<string id="531698"><![CDATA[Yes, I know.]]></string>
<string id="531699"><![CDATA[Do you know the way? Do you have a map?]]></string>
<string id="531700"><![CDATA[Yes, thank you.]]></string>
<string id="531701"><![CDATA[I will soon speak to you as well.]]></string>
<string id="531735"><![CDATA[Yes… Getting everything back on track won't be an easy task…]]></string>
<string id="531736"><![CDATA[How do you think Simon died?]]></string>
<string id="531737"><![CDATA[I don't think he was murdered... How could he who craved monocracy not perish? He couldn't, not in this place… Balance requires equilibrium…]]></string>
<string id="531738"><![CDATA[So Simon's course of action contradicted yours?]]></string>
<string id="531739"><![CDATA[Come now... What I'm saying is... when someone takes too much upon themselves, they always end up… ground down. That's how life works.]]></string>
<string id="531740"><![CDATA[Yet they say Simon was the one to bend the circumstances, not the other way round. No one seems to doubt that.]]></string>
<string id="531741"><![CDATA[Simon has lived a very long life... Very long... He was a worthy man. But long doesn't mean eternal, does it? No one is to blame for his death… Examine the body, you'll see for yourself… It just happened…]]></string>
<string id="531742"><![CDATA[Kain won't let me examine the body.]]></string>
<string id="531743"><![CDATA[Well, that is temporary... A family tradition... He' s not lying to you, he truly believes Simon was murdered. Were he to admit that Simon simply died of death… he'd probably go to his last home himself. The shock would be too much for the man…]]></string>
<string id="531744"><![CDATA[That's strange. Georgiy Kain didn't appear sentimental to me.]]></string>
<string id="531745"><![CDATA[I'll follow your advice.]]></string>
<string id="531746"><![CDATA[But there were signs of an otherworldly visitor that night, weren't there?]]></string>
<string id="531747"><![CDATA[So what you're saying is Simon's death worked in favour of the local hot shots, huh?]]></string>
<string id="531813"><![CDATA[Yes, it will be hard.]]></string>
<string id="531932"><![CDATA[What are you implying? What is this "manner" you're talking about? Be so kind as to mind your own manners... I had nothing to do with it... Don't they say Isidor was murdered by a Steppe demon? A shabnak-adyr? There was that thingie… a talon they fished out from the wound...]]></string>
<string id="531933"><![CDATA[Does he know the Steppe well, that son of yours?]]></string>
<string id="531934"><![CDATA[He rubs elbows with the rabble—the butchers, odonghe, shepherds and gatherers! Learns their tongue! Collects their legends! He doesn't keep them in check at all—they even dare to come visit him within the premises of the town! If you see a Worm creeping through the streets, he's definitely looking for my son!]]></string>
<string id="531935"><![CDATA[What's wrong with them visiting him within the premises of the town?]]></string>
<string id="531936"><![CDATA[They're dangerous, they're aggressive, and they hate everyone... who isn't a Steppe person. They'll jump you and kill you on the spot. They'll tear you up with their teeth and devour your flesh while you're still throwing fists at them! So if they're spotted within the town… counter-measures are taken.]]></string>
<string id="531937"><![CDATA[So what of your son? Perhaps he could tell me more about this creature?]]></string>
<string id="531938"><![CDATA[Hold your horses…! You want to talk to my blockhead? No, you have nothing to talk about! He's not here… thankfully! I don't want you two to meet. You heard me? These are tradesman's words. And I'll stick to them!]]></string>
<string id="531939"><![CDATA[I won't leave it at that.]]></string>
<string id="531940"><![CDATA[Eva, tell me, where does Olgimsky's son live?]]></string>
<string id="531941"><![CDATA[In the Lump... Oh, but wait...! Now that he's at odds with his father, he lives somewhere by the Station... There is an abandoned shack there. They say it's haunted. Vlad is probably listening to the ghosts. He is interested in folk convictions.]]></string>
<string id="531942"><![CDATA[Thank you. I'll pay him a visit.]]></string>
<string id="531943"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="531944"><![CDATA[I have a very bad feeling... The same feeling plagued me just before my father died.]]></string>
<string id="531945"><![CDATA[Lara, do you know where to find Olgimsky's son, Vlad the Younger?]]></string>
<string id="531946"><![CDATA[Yes, I do. He had a quarrel with his father and is now doing field work. I think he's in charge of some excavations, digging out monuments of the Steppe culture. He sleeps in an abandoned shack near the Station. It's close to the Guzzle, the upper tributary of the river.]]></string>
<string id="531947"><![CDATA[You've been very helpful, Lara. Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="531948"><![CDATA[I have a bad feeling too, although I'm generally not superstitious.]]></string>
<string id="531949"><![CDATA[Now, sweetheart, please be so kind as to do me a favour in return. Tell me where Olgimsky's son lives.]]></string>
<string id="531950"><![CDATA[Vlad the Younger? Why would you need him?]]></string>
<string id="531951"><![CDATA[That's better.]]></string>
<string id="531952"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="531953"><![CDATA[See how it all turns out... I used to keep this place secret, but all these secrets seem so childish now…]]></string>
<string id="531954"><![CDATA[Vlad, now tell me... did Isidor visit you last night? Tell me the truth please.]]></string>
<string id="531955"><![CDATA[Yes, Isidor did pay me a visit, but don't ask what we talked about. I have no right to share that with you.]]></string>
<string id="531957"><![CDATA[I don't know. There was a secret dissecting room in one of the warehouses, but no one knows where exactly. He used to live mostly in the Steppe—sometimes sleeping in the Termitary or at Lara Ravel's Shelter. But he's not there, I know that for sure. He went away to mourn his master. What would you have done if you were him?]]></string>

Could it be that the Polyhedron is my udurgh?  ]]></string>
<string id="532004"><![CDATA[The Changeling will come to the Cathedral. She is adamant that she can perform some kind of miracle to protect us all.

I have no proof of this possibility. Her miracle is an act of blind faith. And if I know anything about miracles, it's that they are all too often rotten on the inside.]]></string>
<string id="532005"><![CDATA[I have made my choice. I have decided what the offering will be.

Aglaya will live. The Powers That Be have nothing to hold against her, now that the cure for the Sand Plague has been found.

It's of no importance to me what the Kin will think of my choice. If my refusal to offer a human being as a sacrifice means that they won't let me anywhere near the veins of the udurgh—I will find a different source of blood with which to make the panacea. The Polyhedron will be brought down and rivers of blood will spout from the gaping hole that is left by its foundation.

The prophecy was fulfilled. The lines have led me to the place where my path as a Warden will commence. My father would be proud of me, I think.

Any choice is right as long as it is willed. This is how it is.]]></string>
<string id="532006"><![CDATA[The tangle of lines has formed an intricate ornament. Something that before seemed quite obscure is now illuminated with meaning.

By the will of my father, I should take care of these few children; my Taglur, as Victoria would say. However, it is not either of them that my father was referring to when he spoke of an udurgh. Rather, he referenced the town itself. The town, which exists only by feeding on the will of its inhabitants, just as these children were intended to be fed upon. They were destined to grow up to become the brain of the town, its lungs, and its heart.

If these children see the Polyhedron as their home, it must be protected. Any choice is right as long as it is willed. This is how it is.]]></string>
<string id="532007"><![CDATA[The town I remember so well has become a chimera. It is like a golem these days; a creature made of many parts; each part trying its best to destroy the other. Still, none of the parts may be removed: take an arm or a leg and the whole creature will perish.

All my life I've been taught that nothing may come to pass without a sacrifice. Imagine a famished woman that goes into labour. Which one of them will live: the child or the mother? A choice must be made, otherwise both of them will die. This is—we're taught—the way of the world. There is never a third option.

As I recall these tenets today, I feel all the more confused by their message. Perhaps Clara is right and the miracle is possible? Let it happen then, even if death will breathe down our neck ever after, waiting for a single misstep to plunge us into non-existence. Still any choice is right as long as it is willed. This is how it is.]]></string>

<string id="532645"><![CDATA[Let's get to the point then. A case of pointless, aimless unrest has occured in that hivemind's nest. The workers there are prone to lashing out from time to time like beasts frightened by a storm. They rage, they howl, they gnaw at one another… an unsightly image of a mass uprising.]]></string>
<string id="532646"><![CDATA[What does this have to do with Simon's murder?]]></string>
<string id="532647"><![CDATA[Riots occured in the Termitary several times before. The mob goes crazy for a few days. Then they calm down just as unexpectedly—all of them at once. The sudden calm is just as void of reason as the unrest that had set them agog previously. Having a certain experience with the Kin, we simply block the entrance to this zoo off until the riot defeats itself.]]></string>
<string id="532648"><![CDATA[And?]]></string>
<string id="532649"><![CDATA[We usually lock them up beforehand. The evidence of an upcoming outbreak of mass lunacy becomes obvious in advance, and the Termitary's Father Superior informs us of it. But Father Tycheek has recently passed… a curious coincidence, don't you think? Mass anarchy... Anyway, a member of the Kin managed to run off into the town while we were busy taking measures.]]></string>
<string id="532650"><![CDATA[You think he is the killer?]]></string>
<string id="532651"><![CDATA[I think you and I can help each other, doctor. You are looking for the killer, and I'm sure it is a runaway butcher. The title of a "half-man" suits him very nicely. The Kains claim that Simon had not been killed by a human hand, don't they? And our family doesn't need unnecessary unrest in the town. This butcher can babble devil knows what. His mind is most likely clouded with insane ideas...]]></string>
<string id="532652"><![CDATA[So you'd rather he kept mum about what is happening inside?]]></string>
<string id="532653"><![CDATA[You are correct. They barely know how to speak, but that only makes it worse… Halfmen, halfbeasts—if they start preaching, you feel as though you've encountered a doomsayer. I need this butcher to disappear. Hand him over to the Kains or simply kill him if the beast attacks you. The reward will be hefty.]]></string>
<string id="532654"><![CDATA[Very well, I'll look into this. Where can I find him?]]></string>
<string id="532655"><![CDATA[He is most likely being harbored in a suspicious house... that's in the Crude Sprawl... Yes. My father is a man of rather hard-handed disposition—and quick-tempered to boot. If he finds out the Crude Sprawl is concealing a fugitive… he will make a mess. Pointless brutality serves no one. I'm looking for peace rather than blood, I'm telling you.]]></string>
<string id="532656"><![CDATA[I'll do my best to make sure you're right. Show me the house.]]></string>
<string id="532657"><![CDATA[I thought you treated native people better…]]></string>
<string id="532658"><![CDATA[Are you taking me for a thug or something?]]></string>
<string id="532659"><![CDATA[I'm taking you for a person that's looking for the killer and has the authority to punish him. I'm telling you—there is a rebellious outlaw beast out there. If he attacks you and you're forced to defend yourself, you are free to kill him.]]></string>
<string id="532660"><![CDATA[Where can I find this monster?]]></string>
<string id="532662"><![CDATA[I think your family has the means to send someone who is a better killer than me.]]></string>
<string id="532663"><![CDATA[Why is your family so concerned about public order?]]></string>
<string id="532664"><![CDATA[Because we are rulers. It has nothing to do with charity, trust me. We are in charge of production, after all. If the unrest becomes serious, the factories will stop. The Project will start failing… And we have contracts. We would lose money. I'm surprised I have to explain this to you.]]></string>
<string id="532665"><![CDATA[I understand. So you don't want the runaway to spread unrest among the already scared townsfolk with his words, right?]]></string>
<string id="532666"><![CDATA[Where do I look for this runaway butcher?]]></string>
<string id="532667"><![CDATA[How did he die?]]></string>
<string id="532668"><![CDATA[How should I know? A disease most likely... or an accident or something. That is beside the subject at hand.]]></string>
<string id="532669"><![CDATA[What is the subject then?]]></string>
<string id="532670"><![CDATA[A disease?]]></string>
<string id="532671"><![CDATA[Could be flu or a hernia... I don't know what caused his death, and, frankly speaking, I don't care. When one of these ants dies, the rest loot bits and pieces of him, burying what's left afterwards. Are you asking out of professional curiosity?]]></string>
<string id="532672"><![CDATA[Sort of.]]></string>
<string id="532673"><![CDATA[So why are you telling me all this?]]></string>
<string id="532674"><![CDATA[What is this Kin?]]></string>
<string id="532675"><![CDATA[The Kin is... well, doesn't matter, it's hard to explain. Their whole so-called society. The many-headed biology.]]></string>
<string id="532676"><![CDATA[Very well, let's get back to the subject.]]></string>
<string id="532677"><![CDATA[And that is exactly what's going on there right now, isn’t it?]]></string>
<string id="532678"><![CDATA[Precisely.]]></string>
<string id="532679"><![CDATA[And why are you telling me this?]]></string>
<string id="532680"><![CDATA[No, I haven't.]]></string>
<string id="532681"><![CDATA[The Termitary is a huge bunkhouse where the Bull Project workers live—although "living" is the wrong term for it. They nest. They're nesting as a commune with a rather simple way of life. It could without reservation be called savage.]]></string>
<string id="532682"><![CDATA[And?]]></string>
<string id="532683"><![CDATA[What is the Bull Project?]]></string>
<string id="532684"><![CDATA[It is the whole industrial system of the town, from the Abattoir to the goods station. Would you care to listen as to why I wanted to see you in the first place?]]></string>
<string id="532685"><![CDATA[Very much so. Please go ahead.]]></string>
<string id="532686"><![CDATA[I would like to hear you describe it.]]></string>
<string id="532687"><![CDATA[You are mistaken. I am not looking for any killers.]]></string>
<string id="532688"><![CDATA[Hmm, seems like I was misled. I apologize. If you find yourself interested in this in the future, do keep in mind that I might have a clue.]]></string>
<string id="532689"><![CDATA[Perhaps I'm interested already. Please tell me.]]></string>
<string id="532690"><![CDATA[All right. I'll keep that in mind.]]></string>
<string id="532691"><![CDATA[It's over. The butcher is dead.]]></string>
<string id="532692"><![CDATA[...That's the best news I've heard in the last few days. So it was him that killed Simon, right?]]></string>
<string id="532693"><![CDATA[I doubt that. He's too dumb for that. But he was definitely insane and very dangerous.]]></string>
<string id="532694"><![CDATA[Well, it's for the best. And now I want you to listen to me, doctor. I hold too much respect for you to offer you a reward for this rather… extraordinary service. So please accept this money as a donation from the town's rulers to you—a sign of our support for someone brave enough to commit to your difficult task. Capturing the killer is our direct duty. Please consider this sum to be the Olgimskys' contribution to our common cause.]]></string>
<string id="532695"><![CDATA[This is acceptable if you put it that way, but only that way.]]></string>
<string id="532696"><![CDATA[No need for excuses. I was risking my life, you are compensating me for the risk. We are business people after all. Give me the money.]]></string>
<string id="532697"><![CDATA[This is an insult. When I offer my services for sale, I make that known beforehand.]]></string>
<string id="532698"><![CDATA[Yes, it was.]]></string>
<string id="532699"><![CDATA[Fine. Where can I find this butcher of yours?]]></string>
<string id="532700"><![CDATA[He is most likely being harbored in a suspicious house... that's in the Crude Sprawl... Yes.

<string id="532702"><![CDATA[What do you think about Simon's death?]]></string>
<string id="532703"><![CDATA[Hmm... It is known that Simon had limited his social activity just before his departure. He only received two visitors. I know nothing of the first, but the second was none other than Isidor Burakh. The fact that he was killed the same night makes you think, doesn't it?]]></string>
<string id="532704"><![CDATA[The killer took out a witness?]]></string>
<string id="532705"><![CDATA[Or an accomplice. Isidor was a complicated man. Have I told you about his position in the Kin? He used to be a very well-respected person there… and I can't say everyone liked it.]]></string>
<string id="532706"><![CDATA[What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="532707"><![CDATA[Isidor wasn't a doctor... he was more of a herbalist. He never studied medicine—all his recipes were about plants and roots, so to speak. He was knowledgeable, true. A sorcerer, if you will, but a very different one from Simon. An earthen sorcerer.]]></string>
<string id="532708"><![CDATA[I've never heard that Simon used to be a sorcerer before…]]></string>
<string id="532709"><![CDATA[Simon was a theurgist. Isidor was a witch doctor.]]></string>
<string id="532710"><![CDATA[And you think Isidor the witch doctor has managed to achieve the unachievable? A possible theory, but rather questionable.]]></string>
<string id="532711"><![CDATA[I'll start speaking your tongue myself soon...]]></string>
<string id="532712"><![CDATA[Why would a doctor kill someone?]]></string>
<string id="532714"><![CDATA[Could it be that the killer is hiding in the Willows, where the singer Anna Angel resides? After all, someone covered head to toe in fresh blood was recently offered shelter there.]]></string>

Gotta put even the shabnak-adyg back into the ground for two thousand. The sum ain't pretty, I know, but the times ain't killer on the looks either. I can show the kind sir a way out, by the way...]]></string>

<string id="532728"><![CDATA[These greedy gravediggers aim to make as much as they can by providing unwarranted burial services. Two thousand. And the rascals had the temerity to suggest I pawn some of my belongings to round up the cash!]]></string>
<string id="532729"><![CDATA[I know you're a doctor. A wonderful one at that. A celebrity medic. Everyone in our small town knew that a famous doctor was coming here. I'm very glad you really have—because I want you to do a certain good thing. Can I ask a favour of you?]]></string>
<string id="532730"><![CDATA[Do people around here ever leave their doors unlocked?]]></string>
<string id="532731"><![CDATA[In exceptional cases or emergencies—yes, we do. But generally houses are supposed to be locked up, because they're occupied by several families. People aren't that scared of losing their own belongings, but they care about their neighbours. And now that everyone's so afraid of the maneater... of course everything's locked.]]></string>
<string id="532732"><![CDATA[In that case it won't be too hard to find.]]></string>
<string id="532734"><![CDATA[I've changed my mind. Your stories are indeed troubling. So how do I find that house?]]></string>
<string id="532735"><![CDATA[Capella mentioned it's next to one of the ruins. My friend couldn't hear them properly... Have you seen those stone Stairways to Heaven? I think you might even be able to see the house you're looking for from Eva Yan's window. But most importantly, it should be unlocked.]]></string>
<string id="532736"><![CDATA[In that case it won't be too hard to find.]]></string>
<string id="532737"><![CDATA[Well... I've found it. Unfortunately, the cache has already been looted...]]></string>

<string id="532739"><![CDATA[Well... fine. Let it be as you wish.]]></string>

<string id="532751"><![CDATA[Five years ago something really creepy happened in the Crude Sprawl. People fell sick one after the other—and rapidly, too. The whole district got infected in twenty four hours, house after house. People would burst into sickness like matches burst into flames—and then, like matches, they would burn from the inside. I was a little kid back then, only six years old, but I frequented the Tower already.]]></string>

<string id="532772"><![CDATA[Yes. I'm going to need your help soon.]]></string>
<string id="532773"><![CDATA[Yes... It was a terrible battle. When is this war finally going to end?]]></string>
<string id="532774"><![CDATA[Listen to me. Your main quest is stay at home for now—otherwise you'll get infected and die. Do you believe me?]]></string>
<string id="532775"><![CDATA[Like an angel of death or something?]]></string>
<string id="532776"><![CDATA[Yes... something like that... I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic. If you are, then allow me to say I do not share your feelings.]]></string>
<string id="532777"><![CDATA[I apologize. And how did Simon himself get in there?]]></string>
<string id="532778"><![CDATA[All right... Who among the townsfolk can help me with this?]]></string>
<string id="532779"><![CDATA[My daughter will advise you better there. Her name is Maria. For several days she's been obsessed with some design… that is somehow related to your arrival. Yes, don't be surprised, she knew beforehand that you were coming.]]></string>
<string id="532780"><![CDATA[I'm not surprised.]]></string>
<string id="532781"><![CDATA[I'll find explanations for everything that's going on here—eventually.]]></string>
<string id="532782"><![CDATA[Really? That's good... Anyway, Maria believes that several Bound people will play a special role in your fate. Before you leave this place, of course. Perhaps it is them you should ask for help first?]]></string>

<string id="532784"><![CDATA[I'll look for the murderer myself, using my intuition. I don't need anyone's help with this.]]></string>
<string id="532785"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="532786"><![CDATA[I see. Well, I respect the prudence of your honourable relative. If he insists, I'll continue to work blindfolded.]]></string>

<string id="532788"><![CDATA[You're a bore, mate. Let me through.]]></string>
<string id="532789"><![CDATA[…Indeed? So you've already made it as far as The Willows… which is what her mansion is called. Well, used to be called—before the willows withered. You are quick to make new acquaintances! So what do you make of this lady?]]></string>
<string id="532790"><![CDATA[Suspicious. Hiding something. Lying.]]></string>
<string id="532791"><![CDATA[A charming person. She's a singer, right?]]></string>
<string id="532792"><![CDATA[Aren't you alarmed that there's a dead body at her house? She failed to explain where it came from. I would put her on the list of suspects.]]></string>
<string id="532793"><![CDATA[Curious... She came to that house as a fugitive six years ago... It is hers now. The family that had given her shelter went on to disappear in a rather distasteful manner. The owners succumbed to a fatal disease… that had struck them rather suddenly. And their daughter, Willow, simply vanished.]]></string>
<string id="532794"><![CDATA[And now she's asked me to get rid of a dead body and keep it secret! I think we ought to interrogate her.]]></string>
<string id="532795"><![CDATA[What kind of a person is this Anna?]]></string>
<string id="532796"><![CDATA[I know very little about her. She's been living here for quite some time, but she is very secretive... My daughter has told me that she likes to be the centre of attention, male attention in particular—and yet she doesn't socialize much and is rarely to be seen in public. It's as if she's hiding.]]></string>
<string id="532797"><![CDATA[We should arrest her, just in case.]]></string>
<string id="532798"><![CDATA[What kind of disease?]]></string>
<string id="532799"><![CDATA[A peculiar kind of pest broke out among factory workers five years ago. Not here but in the poor districts. Isidor took care of it quickly. There were many deaths, but only in the Crude Sprawl—a district that borders on the Abattoir. But The Willows is on the riverbank; the infection never made it that far. An odd story, don't you think?]]></string>
<string id="532800"><![CDATA[Very odd. We should arrest that singer. Perhaps she's killed the hitman and is now covering her tracks.]]></string>
<string id="532801"><![CDATA[No, not really. Leave the singer be for now. It's better to watch her for a while.]]></string>

<string id="532835"><![CDATA[Fine, let's leave that subject. I want to know the details. The facts.]]></string>
<string id="532837"><![CDATA[Let us leave mysticism aside.]]></string>
<string id="532838"><![CDATA[We have no choice but to resort to mysticism. There are patterns of a kind that we cannot rationally explain, that are woven into the very fabric of our existence... as if they were veins and we were flesh. This may be an affront to your intelligence... but I cannot help you with that. There are a lot of things about this place that you are very likely to find disconcerting.]]></string>
<string id="532839"><![CDATA[All right, I'll speak to Victor. Where can I find him?]]></string>
<string id="532840"><![CDATA[My brother Victor will see you in the other wing of the house. He will also discuss your reward with you.]]></string>
<string id="532842"><![CDATA[It is all too sudden. I need to think it over.]]></string>
<string id="532843"><![CDATA[You need an investigator here, not a doctor.]]></string>
<string id="532844"><![CDATA[What we need here is someone well versed in logic and analysis. Even better: someone whose judgement is not influenced by deep knowledge of our local affairs. Our past gets in our way. The clarity of your perception will allow you to assess the facts without prejudice. Treat this as an intellectual puzzle. Moreover, I feel that this murder is a message intended for you personally, even though I don't blame you for it.]]></string>
<string id="532845"><![CDATA[You expect a rational calculation from me, but you speak like a mystic.]]></string>
<string id="532846"><![CDATA[I doubt that, Judge. Forgive me, but I regret asking you this question already.]]></string>
<string id="532847"><![CDATA[You are quite a pompous man, Judge. I don't have time for all this talk.]]></string>
<string id="532849"><![CDATA[I see your point.]]></string>
<string id="532850"><![CDATA[Rubin will come here tonight to get down to... examining my brother. You will get acquainted then.]]></string>
<string id="532851"><![CDATA[All right.]]></string>
<string id="532852"><![CDATA[Somewhere in Earth... "Earth" is the name of the lowest part of the town, closest to the Abattoir. I haven't been there for several years... and I don't really know these slums all too well, especially since they were rebuilt after the fire. Victor has visited Isidor from time to time, so speak to him. He is in the wing next door.]]></string>
<string id="532853"><![CDATA[Fine.]]></string>
<string id="532854"><![CDATA[Don't worry, I'll take care of him myself, as soon as I'm done with the examination. My background has prepared me to wield a weapon better than I wield a scalpel.]]></string>
<string id="532855"><![CDATA[Yet we have another concern at hand now. I'll check your drugstores; as for you, please follow your plan.]]></string>
<string id="532856"><![CDATA[Call for me if you need me. I am staying at Eva Yan's place—it's close by.]]></string>
<string id="532857"><![CDATA[Are you sure? Well, doesn't matter anyway... If it's that thing again... What do you think it is?]]></string>
<string id="532858"><![CDATA[Judging from what I've found so far, it could be Febris Typhoidea... or Plague.]]></string>
<string id="532860"><![CDATA[I suspect Yersinia Pestis... or something not too dissimilar. What could these Steppes be home to?]]></string>
<string id="532861"><![CDATA[Hmm... You are unlikely to take them seriously. Let's call it 'folk medicine'. Herbs, eastern recipes, traditional steppe cures. But it works. Master used them during the First Outbreak and he survived, at least.]]></string>
<string id="532862"><![CDATA[When was the first outbreak?]]></string>
<string id="532863"><![CDATA[Five years ago.]]></string>
<string id="532864"><![CDATA[I see... Why are your drugstores in such an appalling state?]]></string>
<string id="532865"><![CDATA[Are they reliable?]]></string>
<string id="532866"><![CDATA[The ones made by Master were. It's a shame there're almost none left. The recipes... are unlikely to be found. I have a single extract left over from the old days; but we should try to find more.]]></string>
<string id="532867"><![CDATA[Okay. Why are your drugstores in such an appalling state?]]></string>
<string id="532868"><![CDATA[They deliver medicine from the regional centre, but there hasn't been a regular train for quite some time. Do you know anything about this, by the way? Perhaps people have some medicine stored at home. But then, it's not like we can take it from them... and the stockpiles are empty.]]></string>
<string id="532869"><![CDATA[Okay. We have another concern at hand now. I'll check your drugstores; as for you, please follow your plan.]]></string>
<string id="532870"><![CDATA[I wish you the best of luck, dear colleague.]]></string>
<string id="532871"><![CDATA[Do you think we're on the verge of an especially unhappy era?]]></string>
<string id="532872"><![CDATA[No grim events have clouded our existence since last summer. The country has cured its war wounds. Commercial communications have been repaired. Astrologists expect nothing ill. Do you hold astrologists' opinions in high regard?]]></string>
<string id="532874"><![CDATA[Why are you giving me that look? As if Simon's death was my fault!]]></string>
<string id="532875"><![CDATA[He's been murdered, yes. Looks like the murderer is always one step ahead of you, doesn't it? The same one that took Simon's life, too. At least, that's the conclusion suggested by the information at my disposal. Same pattern. Same signature.]]></string>
<string id="532876"><![CDATA[So who did it?]]></string>
<string id="532877"><![CDATA[You wouldn't believe it: his own son. The fellow came back after being away for quite a while. His father had sent him to study surgery when he was but a greenhorn. Quite a lot he has learnt, huh? A wandering scholar turned evil to the bone! All of that just to grab the inheritance...]]></string>
<string id="532878"><![CDATA[Wait... How did you figure that out?]]></string>
<string id="532879"><![CDATA[In all honesty, it's hard to explain that to an outsider like you… do you believe in such a thing as clairvoyance, Bachelor?]]></string>
<string id="532880"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="532881"><![CDATA[Well, you should get to know my wife then. Or better yet, those who have already had opportunities to witness the power of her prophecies. Former doubters first and foremost. Rationalists. She's got something to say to you too, by the way…]]></string>
<string id="532882"><![CDATA[So your wife called out Isidor's son specifically?]]></string>
<string id="532883"><![CDATA[So you do have rationalists in the town? Except for me, that is…]]></string>
<string id="532884"><![CDATA[…Not specifically, no. But it all adds up. And the circumstances of Simon's death make you wonder, too. Isidor's son arrived here last night. The timing speaks against him. It even matches the time it takes to get from The Crucible to Isidor's house.]]></string>
<string id="532885"><![CDATA[That's not enough. I'll have to take the investigation into my own hands. Is there anyone who can be of help to me… apart from your wife?]]></string>
<string id="532886"><![CDATA[What about the motive?]]></string>
<string id="532887"><![CDATA[He's the type that needs no motives. Students these days know nothing of virtue and ethics. And a medic, too… Humans are just hairless animals to them—or even a harmful virus infesting the environment. Cynical bastards! …Oh, but I do apologize. Didn't mean to offend you, even by extension.]]></string>
<string id="532888"><![CDATA[I see you like generalizations… I wouldn't be so quick to accuse the junior Burakh.]]></string>
<string id="532889"><![CDATA[That's fine—especially since I agree. I'm fed up with students as well.]]></string>
<string id="532890"><![CDATA[So you'll keep looking for Isidor's murderer?]]></string>
<string id="532891"><![CDATA[I will. Is there anyone that can help me with that?]]></string>
<string id="532892"><![CDATA[You seem to have found him already. Be my guest and tell Georgiy Kain the good news. I'm going back to the Capital.]]></string>
<string id="532893"><![CDATA[An hour has passed. I can leave. The Executor is waiting outside.]]></string>
<string id="532894"><![CDATA[Bachelor!

A detachment of our volunteers were ambushed and massacred by a band of armed marauders. If you have any information at all with regard to the so-called "barbers", I request that you pass it to me without further delay. It is imperative that we put an end to this criminal syndicate as soon as is possible.

I would also like to inform you that in order to fight the criminal spree of robbers and looters, I had no other choice but to withdraw significant numbers of patrolmen whose previous orders were to cordon off the infected districts.

<string id="532895"><![CDATA[Alexander Saburov's Invitation ]]></string>
<string id="532896"><![CDATA[What a grotesque state of affairs. The buildings are not even remotely suitable for my purpose, but I hardly have any choice in the matter. If only by virtue of being spacious, the Theatre and the Cathedral will have to do. I need to conclude the inspection and take the keys to Vlad the Heavy.]]></string>
<string id="532897"><![CDATA[The end is nigh? Why? ]]></string>
<string id="532898"><![CDATA[The end is nigh... Only a miracle can save us... We have to hope for my girl. There's no other choice…]]></string>
<string id="532899"><![CDATA["Dead Tissue"]]></string>
<string id="532900"><![CDATA[The Bachelor needs a sample of infected tissue. A specimen of infected blood may come in handy too.]]></string>
<string id="532901"><![CDATA[*** The tissue was placed under the microscope. I wonder what kind of conclusions he will reach.]]></string>
<string id="532902"><![CDATA[No. I've just finished distribuing the remaining weapons to patrolmen sent to the Bone Stake Lot. Rumour has it, something's brewing there… the rabble are trying to catch some maneater, all agog. But even if I had weapons, I wouldn't give any to you. Why in the world should I?]]></string>
<string id="532903"><![CDATA[Something's brewing? What exactly?]]></string>
<string id="532904"><![CDATA[Where can I get weapons around here?]]></string>
<string id="532905"><![CDATA[No one in the town owns real weapons. What little they have is old, refitted, makeshift—and mostly non-functional, too. I doubt anyone in the town would dare fire a shot without my permission. Nothing of the sort has happened in a few years.]]></string>
<string id="532906"><![CDATA[Your effort is commendable.]]></string>
<string id="532907"><![CDATA[So where did your men go?]]></string>
<string id="532908"><![CDATA[The Bone Stake Lot is located somewhere among the backalleys right in the middle of Earth. Between the Tanners and the Skinners districts. It used to be a huge dump… and before that the mob had used it for their barbaric gatherings. Some time ago they reclaimed the dump and revived the tradition.]]></string>
<string id="532909"><![CDATA[Is this the best description you can offer? It won't be easy to find the place…]]></string>
<string id="532910"><![CDATA[You want to see the maneater too? Don't. Those are just dirty rumours, most likely… or you'll find some poor victim of a frenzied mob there. That's what the patrolmen are for. As for a better description, you can look for a huge upright boulder standing there since the beginning of time. A neolithic artifact.]]></string>
<string id="532911"><![CDATA[What kind of dump?]]></string>
<string id="532912"><![CDATA[The dump's been there since the foundation of the Termitary. Then the construction of the Skinners and the Hindquarters began, and the waste was still dumped in the lot. People grumbled at first, but then they seemed to calm down… and now, recently, they just quietly cleaned it out.]]></string>
<string id="532913"><![CDATA[Where did the waste go?]]></string>
<string id="532914"><![CDATA[No idea. It's like they ate it up. They couldn't have buried it, it's against their rules. They're protecting the earth, those savages… But where did my patrolmen disappear to?]]></string>
<string id="532915"><![CDATA[Should I maybe investigate it?]]></string>
<string id="532916"><![CDATA[Sounds intriguing... But I doubt I have any business there.]]></string>
<string id="532917"><![CDATA[I see. My thanks to you.]]></string>
<string id="532918"><![CDATA[I think I've seen it already.]]></string>
<string id="532919"><![CDATA[Were there any traces?]]></string>
<string id="532920"><![CDATA[Look, I haven't been there myself. I'm quite content with interrogating suspects. Especially since we already know who we're after. You can join the hunt, by the way. I can describe his features.]]></string>
<string id="532921"><![CDATA[Who is it then?]]></string>
<string id="532922"><![CDATA[There is absolutely no need! As of now, total impartiality is my motto.]]></string>
<string id="532923"><![CDATA[Who are the people guarding Isidor's house?]]></string>
<string id="532924"><![CDATA[Those are volunteer patrolmen. We usually keep around twenty of them, but I've increased the number recently to a hundred and a half or so.]]></string>
<string id="532925"><![CDATA[Really? Why do you need so many?]]></string>
<string id="532928"><![CDATA[There's unrest in the Termitary. If I weren't certain that Isidor's been murdered by his son, I would even consider the crime to be politically motivated. Isidor was preparing to take over the Kin and become its leader… at least according to the information I have.]]></string>
<string id="532929"><![CDATA[Your wife again?]]></string>
<string id="532930"><![CDATA[No. The source is a bit more straightforward this time. And you really shouldn't look down on my wife's talents with such skepticism! Although you'll come around soon. Hopefully, your lack of faith won't end up being to costly for you… Time is running short.]]></string>
<string id="532931"><![CDATA[...What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="532932"><![CDATA[Well, talk to her. The entrance to her chambers is on the other side of the house.]]></string>
<string id="532933"><![CDATA[It will be an honour.]]></string>
<string id="532934"><![CDATA[So what, did Isidor leave a fortune?]]></string>
<string id="532935"><![CDATA[Of course I do.]]></string>
<string id="532936"><![CDATA[I have no idea yet. His belongings are being evaluated as we speak. It's not about money though… The Steppe people's idea of heirship still comes with those ancient connotations. Tribal ethics. The next of kin not only inherits things. They inherit knowledge. Fate. Power.]]></string>
<string id="532937"><![CDATA[Such motive is incompatible with a student of medicine in my mind.]]></string>
<string id="532938"><![CDATA[It's in their blood. Oh well… the outlaw will show his true colours soon enough when we catch him. He'll explain the motive himself.]]></string>
<string id="532939"><![CDATA[How did you find him?]]></string>
<string id="532940"><![CDATA[What is this Yulia?]]></string>
<string id="532941"><![CDATA[She came here with an engineering team when the town was being rebuilt. Did logistics or maybe communications… not sure. They said she's a true expert in her field. Smart, yes. A polymath. Then the team left, but she stayed. She has my respect, but not my fondness.]]></string>
<string id="532942"><![CDATA[Exactly the person I need.]]></string>
<string id="532943"><![CDATA[No. If your description holds any merit, she's absolutely not what I'm looking for.]]></string>
<string id="532944"><![CDATA[Oh, I see...]]></string>
<string id="532945"><![CDATA[I'd like to inquire about the fate of my colleague, Isidor Burakh. About the manner of his death, to be precise.]]></string>
<string id="532946"><![CDATA[He will help me find Isidor Burakh's murderer.]]></string>
<string id="532947"><![CDATA[Please kindly refrain from making me regret my previous kindness. Where does he live?]]></string>
<string id="532948"><![CDATA[Wait, what?! Isidor's been killed too? No, it can't be, unbelievable… Who is it walking through the town killing left and right? Oh, they'll come after me soon, too… Oh, please don't go, you hear me? Don't go, I need you to protect me!]]></string>
<string id="532949"><![CDATA[Your eyes… they've turned iron all of a sudden! Or is that irony? No, doesn't seem like it… Oh, I get it now... You're the harbinger that's been my very personal bogeyman all these years. You've been sent to me, haven't you?]]></string>
<string id="532950"><![CDATA[The sooner I speak to Vlad the Younger, the sooner I find the murderer. The sooner I reveal their identity, the sooner I'll put an end to them. Am I making myself clear?]]></string>
<string id="532951"><![CDATA[You won't tell Vlad I gave away his hideout, will you?]]></string>
<string id="532952"><![CDATA[No, Anna. I haven't.]]></string>
<string id="532953"><![CDATA[Yes, you've exposed me. It's me. Speak up now.]]></string>
<string id="532954"><![CDATA[Spill it—right now! I'm way more dangerous than the murderer.]]></string>
<string id="532955"><![CDATA[No way! Not gonna tell you a thing now. Will probably live longer for that, too. If you try to hurt me, I'll scream. I'm a singer, and I have a deafening soprano! Don't you ever forget that! You know how loud I can scream? Like this: aaaaah…]]></string>
<string id="532956"><![CDATA[...Quiet, be quiet!]]></string>
<string id="532957"><![CDATA[A singer, huh… well, you sure as hell like acting up. I'd rather avoid you in the future.]]></string>
<string id="532958"><![CDATA[No, I won't.]]></string>
<string id="532959"><![CDATA[It depends on how the conversation goes.]]></string>
<string id="532960"><![CDATA[...Really? Well, okay then. He's currently residing somewhere by the Station, doing some shady business in an abandoned shack. Is he, like, treasure-hunting...? I haven't been there, but I've heard that he bricked the windows in so that no one would peek... He's probably there right now.]]></string>
<string id="532961"><![CDATA[I can take this from kids and weirdos, but you, a respectable negotiant...]]></string>
<string id="532962"><![CDATA[...It's hard for you to believe, isn't it? It used to be hard for many. Take my boy for example—a scoffer if I've ever seen one—and now even he believes it's real. He went off his head a bit… You're in the Steppe now, esteemed sir, Eastern and backwards. The dead rise from their graves here, clay dummies dance, and bulls talk...]]></string>
<string id="532963"><![CDATA[Right. A demon. Why didn't I think of it straight away? It was so obvious!]]></string>
<string id="532964"><![CDATA[No need to put on airs... Like you know life! Scarcely off the train and full of scorn already… Oh, I know these... big-city manners full well… Yet the Capital is a thousand versts away, as is any other decently civilized place… if you catch my drift. And you didn't let me finish...]]></string>
<string id="532965"><![CDATA[All right, I apologize for the sarcasm. Is your money where your mouth is though?]]></string>
<string id="532966"><![CDATA[So Simon was also killed by this… thing?]]></string>
<string id="532967"><![CDATA[And how do we catch this... creature? There must be a way, right?]]></string>
<string id="532968"><![CDATA[I have no idea. I'm not a Steppe man. These animals are only as interesting to me as they are… erm… productive. All is good as long as… the plow is pulled. As for how they're quacking among themselves… Who would seriously… take interest in that? Why was I cursed with a son like this...? Oh my sins, my grave sins...]]></string>
<string id="532969"><![CDATA[So your son bears little semblance to you?]]></string>
<string id="532970"><![CDATA[You don't seem to like the Steppe people...]]></string>
<string id="532971"><![CDATA[You call them rabble?]]></string>
<string id="532972"><![CDATA[So your son knows who the murderer is? Perhaps you've even giving shelter to them?]]></string>
<string id="532973"><![CDATA[And then nothing. There were little to no casualties among the children—we were in the Tower when it all began. But some kids just had to get out and make themselves busy with the whole outbreak business... invent shmowders, for example. And it worked. It all went on for several days—and then sort of withered all by itself. But the shmowders stayed.]]></string>
<string id="532974"><![CDATA[And where are they?]]></string>
<string id="532975"><![CDATA["Shmowders"? As in… "powders"? What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="532976"><![CDATA[Oooh, powders! Powders-shmowders! Shmowders are sanative mixtures. They were invented during the First Outbreak. The original ones were made by Catchfly, but they were no good; the disease would pass, but the person would pass away along with it. But then Beaker's brothers made some nice ones. Crowfoot's weren't too shabby, and neither were Flanky's...]]></string>

<string id="532984"><![CDATA[Too bad.]]></string>
<string id="532985"><![CDATA[I'm dying to know how exactly these pharmaceutical prodigies were producing these things.]]></string>
<string id="532986"><![CDATA[Well, you know... fiddled here, tampered there. Sniffed around for and obtained different drugs; ground them in a mortar, then mixed them together. But you can't just go ahead an do it, it requires a certain hunch. And even if the hunch was correct, shmowders are still always massively harmful, of course... but they make the disease leave the body. You end up poisoned but alive.]]></string>
<string id="532987"><![CDATA[What disease?]]></string>
<string id="532988"><![CDATA[They mixed various drugs randomly and ingested the resulting substance? Little idiots...]]></string>
<string id="532989"><![CDATA[Every single shmowder that we know of had been stashed away in a safe place here, so that no one would poison themselves, but here we are—no shmowders...]]></string>
<string id="532990"><![CDATA[Maybe it's for the best.]]></string>
<string id="532991"><![CDATA[Can I speak to the inventors of shmowders?]]></string>
<string id="532992"><![CDATA[Nope. Beaker's brothers have grown up and left. Catchfly and Crowfoot died during the tests—back then, I mean. This is why shmowders are so valuable! You can't reinvent them. You need to know the ingredients…]]></string>

<string id="532997"><![CDATA[Well, the "no children allowed" places are more fun anyway.]]></string>
<string id="532998"><![CDATA[I don't understand a thing... How is it dangerous?]]></string>
<string id="532999"><![CDATA[The little ones are playing epidemic again. They wanted to get their hands on these damn shmowders so very much! So now we need to catch the kiddies—and I mean all the kiddies in the town, one by one—and pry the shmowders from their hands. See, the common opinion is that shmowders can cure all kinds of ailments and stuff, but in truth they're deadly!]]></string>
<string id="533000"><![CDATA[I am investigating the murder of Simon Kain. You will answer my questions. Question one: who are you?]]></string>
<string id="533001"><![CDATA[That doesn't sound too convincing. I am not a man to be trifled with, little scamp. I know everything.]]></string>
<string id="533002"><![CDATA[...Yeah, well, it can't be fixed now anyway! All right, I'll tell you. Who knows—perhaps you'll even be of help. The kids are in danger. We've come here to get shmowders, but someone has already looted the cache. Maybe it was Capella's doing? She's probably distributed them among her minions, the pagan!]]></string>
<string id="533003"><![CDATA[Try again—and try to be honest this time.]]></string>
<string id="533005"><![CDATA[Capella? Tell me about her.]]></string>
<string id="533006"><![CDATA[Well.... Capella is Capella. Even though she's our foe, we still respect her. She's luring kids out of the tower, trying to organize a sect of some kind. And they worship her—like, for real. Well, that's understandable; she's the kind of girl that you could even fall in love with. Too bad she's not on our side! Of the river, that is. Pah, pride is the downfall of everyone.]]></string>
<string id="533007"><![CDATA[So what you're saying is she's distributed the shmowders among the kids, right?]]></string>
<string id="533008"><![CDATA[She isn't much of a talker; people even used to think she was mute. But she's so kind, a true angel! Some people would gladly die to be taken care of by someone like her.]]></string>

<string id="533014"><![CDATA[No, not at all... How could someone who had absorbed all our blood not die? A single man cannot handle that. There are limits to a living being's vitality… and there are limits to the world's patience.]]></string>
<string id="533015"><![CDATA[So his death was inevitable, is that what you're saying?]]></string>
<string id="533016"><![CDATA[...Who is to blame for his death? Even if someone did have something to do with it, is that person worth blaming? Most likely, they didn't even realize they were killing someone... Yes, that is how it was. Now I see very clearly...]]></string>

<string id="533024"><![CDATA[Wait! What do you mean by the "limits to a living being's vitality"? I think I've heard that somewhere before...]]></string>
<string id="533025"><![CDATA[Simon transformed our town into a single whole… a living being... He was the heart, and we were the blood running through the town's veins. We radiated his light, and that's why we used to shine so brightly. "The Bound" are actually… bound to Simon…]]></string>

<string id="533028"><![CDATA[I cannot elaborate upon this... I can only feel it. As if this was a heavenly wrath... the payback for all that he had done. The world couldn't stand it anymore.]]></string>

<string id="533035"><![CDATA[Well, eh... Who would have the heart to attack such men? If you had asked me yesterday, I'd have told you no one would dare inflict such an ugly wound on this town.

<string id="533037"><![CDATA[See, this murderous deal is all mysterious... There was a talon stuck in the victim's chest! Go ahead, bend your arm at the elbow, goodsir. Yeah, like that, there you go—that's how long it was. It broke off. There was dust on the floor, for the deceased had been a renowned Steppe-walker; and the dust was all covered in hoofsteps and, like, traces of a sharp bone, I guess? As if someone was using a walking stick 'round there. I'm telling you, it's her. The shabnak-adyr. The clay maneater.]]></string>

<string id="533041"><![CDATA[Well, you're not a local, sir, so you're unlikely to understand the loss we've suffered... Isidor Burakh. A great surgeon, a benefactor to us all, and an all-around skilled doc. An outstanding man, beloved and well-respected by us locals. Does it really always have to take the very best...? What a foul time to live in...]]></string>
<string id="533042"><![CDATA[I knew him. I'm a doctor too.]]></string>
<string id="533043"><![CDATA[Whoever killed our only doc must surely be looking to get us all killed. Isidor could cure anything; he also knew how to make cuts, or incisions, 'cause he was a warden. He knew his lines all right. Like I said, it all makes sense. Whoever killed Simon, took Isidor's life too. And this is merely the beginning...]]></string>
<string id="533044"><![CDATA[My folks don't do no cuttin'. It's just for scares… A good old kick with a big blunt stick on someone's stubborn head—that's another thing entirely, that is.

<string id="533051"><![CDATA[The military will be here tomorrow. They come to raze and demolish. Due to this, we can't avoid making the important choice, for it depends on us whether anything here may be saved. My choice has already been made.

I am going to champion the dream that is doomed to lose its battle with history. From now on, I will use whatever agency I have left to save the condemned creators and their creation, whose sentence was spelled out by evolution itself. I am speaking of the so-styled "Utopians." The four Kains, the architect twins, my good Eva, and, hopefully, Vlad the Younger.

If these people survive, I may be able to preserve one of the most fascinating miracles of this world. I don't have much hope for your assistance, but I urge you not to obstruct me! Beware my wrath if any one of my utopians dies! I am going to fight fiercely for my doomed sovereign.

<string id="533053"><![CDATA[I know you have been told that I am a witch, not a saint. They may have even told you that I am the Sand Pest itself, wearing the masquerade of flesh and blood. They certainly must have told you that I save the castaway and condemn the ingenious. They said that I break the courageous and force them to submit to the plague.

But let me tell you one thing. Saints and miracle-workers are always covered in blood and filth. Their acts are not necessarily comprehensible to the common folk, who expect kindness instead of good and courtesy instead of love... This is not who I am! I know what will happen in three days. I will be able to avoid the contradictions that keep you and the Bachelor in the dark.

Remember, I will perform a miracle in the end. I will perform it with the help of the outcast and the evil. Bad Grief the Thief, Foreman the Villain, Alexander the Cruel, Katerina the Deceived, Lara the Vengeful, Yulia the Unbeliever, Anna the Egotist, Aspity the Heathen, and Rubin the Oathbreaker. They will survive in order to die and upon dying they will claim life everlasting. I need them for the miracle to work.

Remember that.

As I sat down to remember the horrors I had to endure yesterday, a scintillating idea occured to me.

What are you waiting for? Hurry to the Willows!

P. S. Please don't tell anyone about this letter.

<string id="533097"><![CDATA[When was it?]]></string>
<string id="533098"><![CDATA[I attended your lecture—you demonstrated a reanimated lady. Three years ago at Lamarka's. I even took your autograph—the girl in a long shirt, do you remember? I asked you about the glassy lips too.]]></string>
<string id="533099"><![CDATA[Oh... that's some twist of fate. I am very happy to make your acquantaince too, Aglaya. However, back then you introduced yourself as...]]></string>

<string id="533102"><![CDATA[No, I don't seem to remember. Did that really happen?]]></string>
<string id="533103"><![CDATA[Let's get to the point. You wanted to hear my report, didn't you?]]></string>
<string id="533104"><![CDATA[…Indeed, let's get to the point. Your mission was to find a certain way to destroy the enemy completely. All I had to do was implement your solution. So I've looked through your reports—and they've confirmed my greatest fear.]]></string>

<string id="533108"><![CDATA[Events have taken an unexpected turn, Dankovsky. We have a lot to discuss and a lot to do. I'll be brief.

<string id="533109"><![CDATA[Very much so.]]></string>
<string id="533110"><![CDATA[You came here on your own accord, didn't you? Thanatica is in ruins. Your last hope was to draw publicity, to get a sensation. Find something shocking. An ostensive proof of your theory. Correct me if I'm wrong, this is all just my interpretation…]]></string>
<string id="533111"><![CDATA[You are correct so far.]]></string>
<string id="533112"><![CDATA[Then you come across this—allegedly coincidental—letter from Isidor Burakh; and here you are. So timely! Isn't it? And, as luck would have it, the only local medic dies. He didn't die of the disease, did he? That's what I've been told. He was murdered. But luck is on the side of the public!

<string id="533119"><![CDATA[I haven't. It can all be a trap, a double play. We inquisitors are quite cunning, you ought to know that. Relax. Everything I told could turn out to be nothing more that a part of my plan, a provocation. What if in fact I'm loyal to the Powers That Be? Hmm?]]></string>

<string id="533128"><![CDATA[I've heard about the girl. Allegedly, she is deranged. A saint to some, a most dangerous killer to others. She is a very interesting character, and I'm planning to go see her today. Do you have proof?]]></string>

<string id="533136"><![CDATA[The recessive nature of the disease means that there is someone spreading it. The facts are glaring.]]></string>
<string id="533137"><![CDATA[Elaborate on that please. By "recessive nature" you mean that the disease is prone to retreating and then coming back again?]]></string>
<string id="533138"><![CDATA[Indeed. Even though the bacteria dies rapidly, and we took every possible quarantine measure. Very few people were allowed outside.]]></string>

<string id="533163"><![CDATA[I doubt I can do it on my own. Tell me plain and simple; what do you make of all this?]]></string>
<string id="533164"><![CDATA[So I have heard. A wisecrack I know says that while you are trying to complete the portrait of the killer, the killer is busy painting yours. Hilarious, is it not? The hunter becomes the hunted... However, to put it bluntly you have become the keynote of this particular plot. The intrigue is so rich it will keep you busy for a week—if not longer than that.]]></string>

<string id="533173"><![CDATA[You came from the Capital, and your arrival hardly qualifies as a coincidence.

<string id="533175"><![CDATA[Lady aristocrats... Such way of saying it will be of relevance strictly within the specific context of values and perceptions characteristic of a backwoods hole like ours.

<string id="533184"><![CDATA[I'd rather not speak on the matter. You will know Lara well enough as soon as you meet her. My relationship with her is... complicated.]]></string>
<string id="533186"><![CDATA[I can't stand it. It is better to die than to lie.]]></string>
<string id="533187"><![CDATA[I see. Perhaps you like being played with, then?]]></string>
<string id="533188"><![CDATA[Even less so.]]></string>
<string id="533189"><![CDATA[In this case Maria seems to be your best bet. She is too arrogant to lie, and too respectful to dare play with you. You should value the affection of someone this proud... But I digress. What is your intended course of action?]]></string>
<string id="533190"><![CDATA[It depends. It seems the Kains have been so considerate as to promote me to the rank of bait. There is no need for any special efforts to play that role; the main thing is to be available.]]></string>
<string id="533191"><![CDATA[I need to think, if you please. I will ask more questions if something else crosses my mind; especially since you are one of the lady aristocrats.]]></string>
<string id="533194"><![CDATA[In this case I would suggest that Simon was poisoned. By the Kains, I would have thought, but I know their family all too well. Their mutual loyalty is only rivalled by their arrogance towards anyone who is not one of them. They hold the princely sage who stands at the head of their family in highest esteem. They believe that a single dishonourable act will tarnish their name for generations to come... I doubt any of them would have stooped to this. No matter whether they wanted to or not.]]></string>

<string id="533204"><![CDATA[Where is Andrey?]]></string>
<string id="533205"><![CDATA[Andrey has gone to the marsh—to kill Eva's abductors. He was in such a hurry he didn't even wait for me.]]></string>
<string id="533206"><![CDATA[All right. I'll take it.]]></string>
<string id="533207"><![CDATA[What, should he have left her to her own devices then?]]></string>
<string id="533208"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="533209"><![CDATA[Аh... You've come at last! Thanks—but evidently it has all been pointless. I'm an idiot. ]]></string>
<string id="533211"><![CDATA[Actually, she is… was. She was free to choose her own life and do as she pleased, but she was my woman. You have nothing to be distressed about; your woman is Maria. I would have gladly switched places with you, but she obviously would never see an equal in me... and it's irrelevant now anyway.]]></string>
<string id="533212"><![CDATA[So what happened to Eva? ]]></string>
<string id="533213"><![CDATA[What do you mean? Eva jumped from the balustrade of the Cathedral. That's the kind of a Cathedral we have now—consecrated by suicide! But poor Eva thought otherwise... She wanted to become the Soul of the Cathedral. She never knew that the stupid construction was not intended to be a Focus! ]]></string>
<string id="533214"><![CDATA[But others are?]]></string>
<string id="533215"><![CDATA[Erecting a construction that can hold a soul is not humanly possible. We've only managed to do it once—just recently; but that's another story. You'll come to know everything in due time. As for our Cathedral, it's cursed. The whole town is—since today.]]></string>
<string id="533216"><![CDATA[She wrote a letter to me too. Said she was going to purify the place for the new guest. That means the place is the Cathedral and the guest is Aglaya, right? ]]></string>
<string id="533218"><![CDATA[You are probably right. Let's go.]]></string>
<string id="533219"><![CDATA[Somehow this death has impacted me more than the thousands upon thousands of other deaths that have occurred here recently…]]></string>
<string id="533220"><![CDATA[Yes... It does feel that way. Let's go, Andrey. There's nothing left for us in this marsh.]]></string>

<string id="533223"><![CDATA["Eva is No More"]]></string>
<string id="533224"><![CDATA[Where is Eva? I am not the only one worried by her absence. Andrey Stamatin is completely beside himself. I wonder who told him of her disappearance.]]></string>
<string id="533225"><![CDATA[Andrey has gone to the Steppe, where the odonghe gatherers set up their tents. He thinks that Eva was kidnapped and has became a "Worm Bride".]]></string>
<string id="533226"><![CDATA[*** Eva is no more. All she wanted was to put a miracle into practice and become the living soul of the lifeless Cathedral. Could it be that she chose the most terrible act imaginable to accomplish this? Eva... Eva... There is an enormous gap between self-sacrifice and suicide.]]></string>
<string id="533227"><![CDATA[Eva stood on the edge of the balustrade. She raised her hands up into the air and stepped forward.

The wind did not carry her. She did not fly. The miracle did not happen.

I know why Eva did what she did. Would you like me to tell you? Aglaya is not the new guest. It is not the pestilence in the Cathedral that is blasphemous. The true blasphemy is your negligence. You were meant to achieve victory yesterday. You did not.

Perhaps your latest muse will do better than the late one? She was setting up the place in your heart where the new guest will stay.

Put your mind to it, when at leisure.

Clara, the Harbinger]]></string>

<string id="533237"><![CDATA[Turns out that Aglaya Lilich is your relative? I didn't know that. ]]></string>
<string id="533238"><![CDATA[Yes. She is the younger sister of my lovely mother. And there is not a single person in the world who would hate my mother more viciously than she does. ]]></string>
<string id="533239"><![CDATA[She claims to be fond of you.]]></string>
<string id="533240"><![CDATA[I saw Aglaya tonight! At dawn, just before she arrived! I sat here, trying to think about… about my lovely mother. Suddenly it was as if something had touched me, making the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I rushed to the window—and there I saw her!]]></string>
<string id="533241"><![CDATA[What did she do? ]]></string>
<string id="533242"><![CDATA[Pale as death, she stood by the window, pressing her palm against the pane. And her face touched the glass too, ever so slightly—only the tip of her nose... She looked straight at me, unblinking. She could not enter. But she wanted to so very much... ]]></string>

<string id="533249"><![CDATA[What's her business in town?]]></string>
<string id="533250"><![CDATA[I think she was going to see the architects. Andrey or Peter. Peter, most likely. She needed to know something about the Tower. About the inner workings of some chambers, I believe. She's particularly concerned about it now... because of Simon's memory fading.]]></string>

<string id="533276"><![CDATA[So the elder girl did something that scared the younger and then grew up to become an Inquisitor? No wonder the younger girl misunderstood the situation. But now, the prejudice Maria Kaina seems to have against Aglaya Lilich may have a bearing on the town politics. I have to try, though. Blessed are the peacemakers.]]></string>
<string id="533277"><![CDATA[What is on Maria's mind? Where did she go, in disregard of all my prohibitions? It appears she was careless enough to let her father in on her plan, and that he told her to forget about it at once.]]></string>
<string id="533278"><![CDATA[Is today the last chance for the father to see his beloved daughter? Could it be that the most reasonable of the town rulers is drifting towards expiration? Doesn't look like it. Rather, it seems quite the opposite. But then, what did he mean? And Maria, what would she possibly want with Peter Stamatin?]]></string>
<string id="533279"><![CDATA[*** Hmm... It seems that setting up this meeting was not such a good idea. But why did Aglaya say that the fate of the settlement depends on what she and Maria will have to tell each other? Apparently, this situation is less of a family affair than it first appeared...]]></string>
<string id="533280"><![CDATA[I think I should pay a visit to Peter. After all, Maria deserves to know the real reason of this incidental family meeting. It would also be interesting to learn the result of it. I feel I will have to spend a hefty measure of smelling salts to find out.]]></string>

<string id="533310"><![CDATA[How are you lot going to return then?]]></string>
<string id="533311"><![CDATA[We're not… we're an operational squad. Tomorrow we'll be sent on a very important mission to deal with the oppressors that are trying to exterminate us. And, well, tough luck for us. The Tower is only impregnable for the infection from the outside. That's just how it works. The mechanics of it.]]></string>
<string id="533312"><![CDATA[All right. I'll talk to Capella.]]></string>
<string id="533313"><![CDATA[What a lovely lady! She welcomed us, she talked to us! Children are not allowed to be in contact with the Kin people, you know… Forbidden fruit and all that. It is the sweetest one.]]></string>
<string id="533315"><![CDATA[They say, young lady, that you are somewhat sceptical towards the peculiar qualities of this... Polyhedron?]]></string>
<string id="533316"><![CDATA[I don't know... You are brave, and my duty dictates caution. It's getting more and more frightening by the minute. The reckoning is yet to come... if it hasn't already. The Tower defies the very nature of miracles, you see. It imprisons them. That's why the wisest children have already left it.]]></string>
<string id="533317"><![CDATA[How curious... Which ones? Apart from you, that is.]]></string>
<string id="533318"><![CDATA[Taya Tycheek, for instance. A five-year-old kid worshipped by the Kin. They call her the Mother Superior. She was merely a careless kidling in the Tower, and now she is in charge of the Termitary and the five thousand souls inside. Have you been there already, by the way? I'm worried about her...]]></string>
<string id="533319"><![CDATA[All right.]]></string>
<string id="533320"><![CDATA[Capella asked me to give the medicine to warden Tycheek's little daughter, this extraordinary child whom the "beastly crowd of primates" obey and serve as they would serve a little goddess. Apparently the children's mysterious influence in the town extends much further than the Kain family.]]></string>
<string id="533321"><![CDATA[The emissaries from the Tower request that I leave the Tower and its residents alone. As if I was pestering them all this while! They say that everything is perfectly well inside the Tower and that Olgimsky's daughter will confirm it. This serves more to increase my suspicions than curb them. Only yesterday the same kind of assurances were offered with regard to the Termitary. I need to speak with Capella.]]></string>
<string id="533322"><![CDATA[Take this news as a matter of urgency and importance, Bachelor.

<string id="533343"><![CDATA[He didn't even sell them, he gave them to me basically for free—or maybe for a token payment. You know… I never expected something like this from him.

<string id="533366"><![CDATA[*** What is going on? Are they playing tricks on me again? It shouldn't be hard to tell...

<string id="533369"><![CDATA[What kind of game is that?]]></string>
<string id="533370"><![CDATA[Well... A stupid kind, to be honest. Sort of doctors and hospitals and stuff… don't you know how preschoolers play?]]></string>
<string id="533371"><![CDATA[All right. So what about the… shmowders?]]></string>
<string id="533372"><![CDATA[I've come to miss the days when I used to play such games…]]></string>
<string id="533373"><![CDATA[I am certainly no better investigator than you. I never had a chance to search for a murderer before... The best I can offer is to fill in the blanks with whatever mysterious supernatural entities seem most fitting. Shabnak-adyr is the simple man's scarecrow. I would have followed a different narrative. ]]></string>
<string id="533374"><![CDATA[What kind of narrative? Consider the circumstances of his death. They said Simon had locked himself up in the evening and consequently died in the morning inside the mansion, in a chamber with some peculiar name.]]></string>
<string id="533375"><![CDATA[Do you like Eva Yan?]]></string>
<string id="533376"><![CDATA[Very much. It wouldn't be much of a stretch to say I absolutely admire her.]]></string>
<string id="533377"><![CDATA[Weird. I expected you to have a different opinion of her.]]></string>
<string id="533378"><![CDATA[She dons the mask of absent-minded promiscuity. But this pose has nothing to do with what she really is. I'd be happy to be friends with her. But she does not understand me—and rightfully so, considering her eminence.]]></string>
<string id="533379"><![CDATA[I can't believe my ears.]]></string>
<string id="533380"><![CDATA[Sooner or later, a fervent believer may emerge from within her, dissolving her completely in the object of her adoration. After which she will probably kill herself. But I'd rather talk no more of that.]]></string>
<string id="533381"><![CDATA[All right.]]></string>
<string id="533382"><![CDATA[Why is that?]]></string>
<string id="533383"><![CDATA[They say that Lara is an angel; an epitome of benevolence and compassion. She sees everyone as a friend. She is too eager to help; too happy to oblige... After her father died, she turned the Ravel mansion into the most hospitable and heartwarming place in town. Long story short, Lara is believed to be the kindest woman of us all. However...]]></string>
<string id="533384"><![CDATA[That's not true?]]></string>
<string id="533385"><![CDATA[She is a woman devastated by grief. All the gifts that she is so happy to give away are, fundamentally, offerings to a dead person. She favours the living with something the dead have no use for. ]]></string>
<string id="533386"><![CDATA[Really?]]></string>
<string id="533387"><![CDATA[Her philantropy is almost reprehensible. She pities everyone she comes across, for she knows they will all die just like her dearly departed. She sees a corpse in everyone she looks upon. I can't say I appreciate it. But that being said, she will certainly be of great help to you and your enquiry.]]></string>
<string id="533388"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="533391"><![CDATA[Who is the addressee?]]></string>
<string id="533392"><![CDATA[Could it be her late father? This is merely a speculation though, something I was able to conjecture from what observations I made.]]></string>
<string id="533393"><![CDATA[So Lara is no angel?]]></string>
<string id="533394"><![CDATA[I struggle to imagine a person whose name is less reflective of her inner self.]]></string>
<string id="533395"><![CDATA[An unforgiving description.]]></string>
<string id="533396"><![CDATA[Unforgiving, but fair. Anna affects to be suffering, but her hypocrisy is all too easy to see through. If she was genuinely wanted—for the February Riots, or for the Caravan—she would have been found years ago. She manages to trick her destiny for now, but her luck will run dry soon enough.]]></string>
<string id="533397"><![CDATA[How is she cheating fate?]]></string>
<string id="533399"><![CDATA[What? What caravan?]]></string>
<string id="533400"><![CDATA[The Ace of Diamonds Caravan. It left a ghastly imprint on her, the way it did with everything it came close to. Still, I am not entirely positive whether Anna has travelled with the caravan or not. She is a singer, allegedly, and the caravan comprised entertainers of different persuasion. But is she really an actress? This remains to be seen. What seems peculiar is how artificial, and how contrived this dark secret appears to be. As if it were a disguise.]]></string>
<string id="533401"><![CDATA[What could she be afraid of?]]></string>
<string id="533405"><![CDATA[Poisoned? How did you arrive at this conclusion?]]></string>
<string id="533406"><![CDATA[I don't believe you understand what "he died in Focus" really implies. Do you know what the Kains refer to as "Focus"? You don't seem to grasp the semantics of the term. These are the Kains for you; these kinds of innuendos are their forte.]]></string>
<string id="533408"><![CDATA[What's that word… the one you've just said?]]></string>
<string id="533409"><![CDATA[Shabnak-adyr, you mean? The Steppe demonology describes it as a kind of golem; belched up by the Earth to punish all manner of delinquency. It is shaped as a young woman, but made of clay and exhumed bone matter. An unnerving concept, is it not?]]></string>
<string id="533410"><![CDATA[I've always suspected that primitive worldviews still exist in the remote corners of our country, but I couldn't imagine they would be so active…]]></string>
<string id="533411"><![CDATA[I knew you would be exasperated by this discussion. Sacrifices... bovine tails... handfuls of milk-teeth in a glass beaker. You may forgive this to children and Steppe people, yet having the same notions reiterated by someone surrounded by books on natural history? This must be quite vexing.]]></string>
<string id="533412"><![CDATA[How would you explain this?]]></string>
<string id="533413"><![CDATA[The answer is bound to irritate you even more. The tales are true.]]></string>
<string id="533414"><![CDATA[Bah! You are joking, of course?]]></string>
<string id="533415"><![CDATA[I do hyperbolise a little. It is beyond debate that Shabnak-adyr exists. What is dubious though is that bovine tails and milk-teeth offer genuine protection from her. Which is to say, sympathetic contrivances like this may be of some use to children and people from the Steppe, but are explicitly inefficacious for someone like you and me. We are too literate, too deprived of the scripture codified in ancient soil.]]></string>
<string id="533416"><![CDATA[So? Am I supposed to write off a bad harvest as a sign that the Steppe spirits are angry now?]]></string>
<string id="533417"><![CDATA[We have no choice but to acknowledge the rules enforced by the Steppe. We tried to ignore these rules; to place ourselves into the framework of advanced modernity... to no avail. You can call these demons what you want... you may refer to the Hair Eater as "time" if this will make you any happier. I am comfortable with a more juvenile vernacular. It is what I am used to.]]></string>
<string id="533418"><![CDATA[I will find a rational explanation for the crimes of this maneater by the evening. If you help me, of course...]]></string>
<string id="533419"><![CDATA[So you believe all that yourself, too?]]></string>
<string id="533422"><![CDATA[Things like this can drive you mental—especially with a backdrop of primitive relics…]]></string>
<string id="533423"><![CDATA[The world is defined by a plethora of causal relationships. These causalities, however, are located at different tiers of human perception. There is a tier where people may change them instictively—due to their inane propensity for acting in a reasonable, egocentric manner—and the scale of this tier is negligibly insignificant. In layman's terms, catching a glass before it touches the floor does not mean the glass wouldn't break within next few minutes. ]]></string>
<string id="533424"><![CDATA[Elaborate on that please. I don't understand.]]></string>
<string id="533425"><![CDATA[Take my own death, for instance. It depends on a myriad of contingent coincidences. In our town, such coincidences have put together several women whose inexplicable aptitude allows them to see the whole chain of cause-effect connections. They also see where the chain would lead; which is to my death. How's that for an example?]]></string>
<string id="533426"><![CDATA[But what about free will? Can't the people that can affect this tragic event change the course of causes and consequences?]]></string>
<string id="533427"><![CDATA[If a Mistress were to intuit that there is no man or woman capable of breaking—or mending—these kinds of connections, she would not hesitate to reveal the future. Her account would be exhaustive at times, but it is more likely to be somewhat vague... This is merely speculation, though. I won't be surprised if reality proves to be much more terrifying than that.]]></string>
<string id="533428"><![CDATA[Terrifying? What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="533429"><![CDATA[I'd rather not entertain the thought. The world is so small, perhaps, and we have so little time left, that all that lies ahead may be foreseen in the most minute detail. Someone may be sitting somewhere this very moment—and seeing everything that we are doomed to suffer.]]></string>
<string id="533430"><![CDATA[No, I don't want to believe this.]]></string>
<string id="533431"><![CDATA[Tell me, Yulia, are there people that I can talk to directly, without revelations or allegories, in town?]]></string>
<string id="533432"><![CDATA[Who are these women?]]></string>
<string id="533433"><![CDATA[We refer to them as Mistresses. The first two were smart enough not to squander their gift with marketplace tomfoolery. Regrettably, both are dead. The third is still alive. There are also a few aspirants that try to interpret the words of the Mistresses, or regurgitate them within their own prophecies. It is all child's play though.]]></string>
<string id="533434"><![CDATA[How could they predict fortunes?]]></string>
<string id="533435"><![CDATA[Well, I didn't let the glass break, did I? Or is it a connection I've changed instinctively?]]></string>
<string id="533437"><![CDATA[A curious conclusion, but an incorrect one. Simon was disfigured and bleeding. His bones were broken.]]></string>
<string id="533438"><![CDATA[All right. Let me suggest, then, that while he was in the Steppe, he saw or learned something that he wanted to report to all three ruling families. In this case, either of the Olgimsky family should have been on his itinerary—especially since Burakh was one of their own men.]]></string>
<string id="533439"><![CDATA[But did they? Want to do it, I mean?]]></string>
<string id="533440"><![CDATA[In all likelihood, they did. Their respect for Simon was nothing compared to the adoration felt by the common townspeople. After all, every Kain suffers the same kind of benign insanity that leads to people pursuing their own fantasies—and little else other than that. This indulgence is something that Simon would likely stand in the way of.]]></string>
<string id="533441"><![CDATA[So you think the cause of death is poison?]]></string>
<string id="533442"><![CDATA[Well, what is this "Focus" then?]]></string>
<string id="533443"><![CDATA[The Focus is anything but an abstraction. Quite the opposite in fact, it is governed by mathematically rigid regularities. You see, no one but the owner of a Focus may get inside. This can only mean that Simon had brought the killer with him. Or rather—within him, since no physical object may be brought into Focus either.]]></string>
<string id="533444"><![CDATA[How do you know that?]]></string>
<string id="533445"><![CDATA[Who doesn't? The Kains are notoriously passionate about all manner of synthetic anomalies. They will never pass up the opportunity to devise a kunststück that would allow them to warp space, challenge physics, or manipulate optics... Metaphysically, a Focus can be compared to a camera obscura; do note that the name is not unfitting. No. It is entirely impossible for someone to get inside.]]></string>
<string id="533446"><![CDATA[And you're also not allowed to eat or drink… But that makes one suspect foul play in regard to Isidor's death. He had been stabbed, after all.]]></string>
<string id="533447"><![CDATA["Stabbed" does not even begin to describe it. Stakh Rubin told Lara that Isidor was slaughtered by some object resemblant of a humongous, razor sharp talon. What a riveting case... No wonder some people will start talking of Steppe monsters made of assorted bones.]]></string>
<string id="533448"><![CDATA[What? A claw-like object?]]></string>
<string id="533449"><![CDATA[Such was the "topography of the wound"—according to Rubin. Neither Lara nor me are quite able to colloquialize a term like this... You should speak with him directly if you wish to know the details. Make haste if you want to get ahold of him; Rubin is eager to join Simon as soon as possible... no pun intended.]]></string>
<string id="533450"><![CDATA[Yes... Let's get back to the subject of Isidor's murder.]]></string>
<string id="533452"><![CDATA[As you wish.]]></string>
<string id="533453"><![CDATA[Yeah, same here.]]></string>
<string id="533454"><![CDATA[Oh good heavens! To think this woman has been introduced to me as a sceptic and an analyst!]]></string>
<string id="533455"><![CDATA[…All right then. Who are these influential ladies?]]></string>
<string id="533456"><![CDATA[Can't say I care all that much. I can live with it.]]></string>
<string id="533457"><![CDATA[So there's a bloodied man hiding in her house. Where would that be?]]></string>
<string id="533458"><![CDATA[Mysteriously?]]></string>
<string id="533459"><![CDATA[They all died of natural causes, allegedly; even though Willow was buried in a tightly closed coffin. The body was examined by Isidor Burakh, however, and he is not a man who would cover up a crime. Anyway, you would do good to take a look at the house yourself. The mansion is known as the Willows, it stands by the Gullet, in Earth.]]></string>
<string id="533460"><![CDATA[For crying out loud, Yulia... You are a mystic. Saburov is mocking me!]]></string>
<string id="533461"><![CDATA[You are repeating something that Isidor had once told me, almost word for word... By the way, I find his murder far more infuriating than Simon's!]]></string>
<string id="533462"><![CDATA[Is that so? Well, this does introduce a different perspective... Did you say Isidor was the last person to see Simon? The question is, who did he see before? The sun had not yet set when Isidor returned from the Steppe. However, he came to Simon well after midnight. The question naturally arises; where did he spend the missing few hours?]]></string>
<string id="533463"><![CDATA[That is why I'm trying to trace Isidor's steps. I want to walk the same route; don't get me wrong though...]]></string>
<string id="533464"><![CDATA[Was Isidor seen with Saburov, by any chance?]]></string>
<string id="533465"><![CDATA[He was. He warned Saburov of an upcoming storm.]]></string>
<string id="533466"><![CDATA[Where is Rubin at the moment?]]></string>
<string id="533467"><![CDATA[Mourning his master, I think. They were very close. Did you investigate Isidor's house yet?]]></string>
<string id="533468"><![CDATA[Yes, but they won't let anyone in there.]]></string>
<string id="533469"><![CDATA[How do you know all that?]]></string>
<string id="533470"><![CDATA[I think you still fail to grasp the entirety of your predicament. The rumours spread like wildfire here. One of the children saw Isidor come home. They were waiting by the entrance, eager to hear a Steppe story or two.]]></string>
<string id="533471"><![CDATA[So the prosecution of Isidor's son is based on the testimony of a child? That is what Saburov claims.]]></string>
<string id="533472"><![CDATA[I don't know, but Saburov interpreted his coming as an omen of an upcoming unrest among the workers.]]></string>
<string id="533473"><![CDATA[Really?]]></string>
<string id="533474"><![CDATA[Definitely. The Bull Project—from the Abattoir to the railway—is controlled by the Olgimsky family. If Isidor's discovery had anything at all to do with the Kin, Isidor would have certainly relayed it to Vlad. So do make sure to pay a visit to The Lump. That's the name of the Olgimsky mansion... another fitting name, wouldn't you agree?]]></string>
<string id="533475"><![CDATA[Where does the information come from then?]]></string>
<string id="533476"><![CDATA[I don't think you're aware of the fact that Isidor came to me last night, just after he had returned, and warned me that there were some… ominous events ahead of us. I took that as an unofficial warning about his upcoming takeover.]]></string>
<string id="533477"><![CDATA[Curious... Thank you for telling me this.]]></string>
<string id="533478"><![CDATA[…So you took measures?]]></string>
<string id="533479"><![CDATA[Erm. Evidently. I've mobilized the patrols. I see what you're implying, Bachelor, but I'm not insane. Engineering Isidor's murder… as a matter of fact, a strong, indepentent Kin under Isidor's rule would have been way more useful to me.]]></string>
<string id="533480"><![CDATA[Really? Why?]]></string>
<string id="533481"><![CDATA[Because that would weaken the power of the honourable Vladislav Olgimsky, who's pocketed the economy of the whole town! He'd rather see the Kin as a dumb and speechless herd… And come to think of it… well, I'm sure you understand where I'm going with this.]]></string>
<string id="533482"><![CDATA[I do.]]></string>
<string id="533483"><![CDATA[...This is precisely what Georgiy warned me about...]]></string>

<string id="533486"><![CDATA[Let's be friends now. I prefer being friends with everyone.]]></string>
<string id="533487"><![CDATA[Well, it is empty at the moment because...  everyone is grief-stricken. But I usually have a lot of guests. The doors of this house are always open for my friends and for the friends of my friends, day and night.]]></string>

<string id="533492"><![CDATA[Who are the "capital-M" Mistresses then?]]></string>
<string id="533493"><![CDATA[The Mistresses of the town. We call them the "Dream Mistresses". Kaina, Olgimskaya, and Saburova. Now, after Victoria's and Nina's departure, it's their daughters who are trying to see the future. They are far less impressive than their mothers for now, of course... Maria is probably the best.]]></string>

<string id="533496"><![CDATA[Badly. It's nice that you can sleep all day at times like this—but the nightmares are horrible... I can only imagine what kind of hell the Mistresses are going through.]]></string>

<string id="533501"><![CDATA[There was a peculiar incident yesterday by the Spleen. The children were playing in the mud as usual, but then suddenly they ran away from the sandbox and the parents noticed that their hands were smothered in blood. However, none of them were wounded. Neither were any of them surprised.]]></string>
<string id="533502"><![CDATA[Please do.]]></string>
<string id="533503"><![CDATA[A few years ago the child death rate went through the roof here. Six people died in a week. Ten or so came down with serious illnesses. It made us worried, but unfortunately... we couldn't find the cause straight away back then. In the end it turned out that children were dying because of a game.]]></string>
<string id="533504"><![CDATA[What in the world… What kind of a game kills children?]]></string>
<string id="533505"><![CDATA[They were playing... hmm, what did they call it...? Well, it was some kind of medical game. They were stealing medicine from the adults and making some diabolical mixture out of it. Then they "healed" each other with it... Back then the game just faded into obscurity, but now I've heard they were contemplating doing it again. Someone has already been poisoned.]]></string>
<string id="533506"><![CDATA[But what can I do? I'm no poisoning specialist. I can do an examination, of course, but...]]></string>
<string id="533511"><![CDATA[Depends on what you need... According to Katerina, I don't have that much time left. She's a Mistress, isn't she?]]></string>
<string id="533512"><![CDATA[No, no, it's much simpler. There is a house somewhere in the town, either abandoned or just unoccupied... That's where they play hospital. That's where they store their horrible mixtures. Please, use your standing and your celebrity name to put an end to this game! Capella, Olgimsky's daughter, believes that the house will be unlocked today.]]></string>
<string id="533513"><![CDATA[I'll do my best, of course. How can I find the house?]]></string>
<string id="533514"><![CDATA[Capella mentioned it's next to one of the ruins. My friend couldn't hear them properly... Have you seen those stone Stairways to Heaven? I think you might even be able to see the house you're looking for from Eva Yan's window. But most importantly, it should be unlocked.]]></string>
<string id="533516"><![CDATA[No, I don't have time for this.]]></string>
<string id="533517"><![CDATA[But what for?]]></string>
<string id="533518"><![CDATA[I tried to ask the kids, but they don't trust us. They think we want to put an end to this dangerous game because we are mean and stupid adults that simply don't get it... So your arrival has come in very handy.]]></string>

<string id="533525"><![CDATA[I don't understand... What would that be for? ]]></string>
<string id="533526"><![CDATA[The Commander wants to know who the woman is. Just tell him the assassin is me. Tell him that whoever else comes to shoot him with a weapon that does not fire is merely a madwoman, keen to sacrifice herself for me.

Extend a hand today to thy neighbour, and he will do the same for you tomorrow. And even if he doesn't—so what? The giver's own virtues will be his consolation all the more!]]></string>
<string id="533562"><![CDATA[Hey, it's just girls' business, all right? Anyway… I wanted to do a good deed for once, wash away my old stains, so to speak… and that's what I get in return! You won't even appreciate my sacrifice. And I promised to give you the panacea—the sample that I got from Vlad the Younger.]]></string>
<string id="533563"><![CDATA[Fine, give me the little thing. I'll deliver it to Lara.]]></string>
<string id="533564"><![CDATA[Why do you look at me with such… disapproval? Have I done something wrong?]]></string>
<string id="533565"><![CDATA[I have delivered the pistol to Lara. It's done. ]]></string>
<string id="533566"><![CDATA[And here's the reward... See? I'm giving it to you. I part with it as easily as I acquired it! Well? Do you admire me?]]></string>
<string id="533567"><![CDATA[Let me talk to Lara first. And this so-called panacea... well, that's an entirely different story.]]></string>
<string id="533568"><![CDATA[I am positively charmed.]]></string>
<string id="533569"><![CDATA[Give me the pistol. I'll do it.]]></string>
<string id="533570"><![CDATA[Take it now! It's safe to put it in your trouser pocket. It won't fire.]]></string>

<string id="533574"><![CDATA[It is clear that Yulia wants to shield Lara, even though she tries her best to make it look as though she expects to benefit from it. Is she really inclined to play this kind of game with Fate? Her strategy is simple: she will let the Commander know that the mysterious avenger is none other than her. She expects to suffer the consequences.]]></string>
<string id="533575"><![CDATA[With hardly any consideration, the Commander sent an outfit of his riflemen to Yulia's place. Could it be that she merely wanted armed protection around the clock? If this is the case I'd better take the panacea from her. Who knows if her academic fervour will compell her to test the cure on one of the guards?]]></string>
<string id="533576"><![CDATA[*** The deed is done. Yulia's fatalism was further reinforced. It appears that everything she does is a part of some intricate plan. Her restless mind is constantly occupied by some furtive activity, invisible but no less dangerous for that.]]></string>

<string id="533578"><![CDATA[Lara wants to kill somebody. She asked me to bring her a smaller pistol, for she is unable to handle that of a regular size. Who does she want to shoot? Even with the tiniest firearm imaginable her escapade would prove to be nothing but a suicide attempt.]]></string>

<string id="533581"><![CDATA[Anna asked me to give a small pistol to Lara, ostensibly for protection, but the reward she is promising is too much for such a simple errand.]]></string>
<string id="533582"><![CDATA[I need to bring it up with Anna. After all, her request is suspicious; as is her knowledge of Lara's affairs. Something is definitely wrong here.]]></string>
<string id="533583"><![CDATA[*** The deed is done. At least the panacea is in good hands now. I will find a better use for it.]]></string>
<string id="533584"><![CDATA[I know you have been told that I am a witch, not a saint. They may have even told you that I am the Sand Pest itself, wearing the masquerade of flesh and blood. They certainly must have told you that I save the castaway and condemn the ingenious. They said that I break the courageous and force them to submit to the plague.

But let me tell you one thing. Saints and miracle-workers are always covered in blood and filth. Their acts are not necessarily comprehensible to the common folk, who expect kindness instead of good and courtesy instead of love... This is not who I am! I know what will happen in three days. I will be able to avoid the contradictions that keep you and the Haruspex in the dark.

Remember, I will perform a miracle in the end. I will perform it with the help of the outcast and the evil. Bad Grief the Thief, Foreman the Villain, Alexander the Cruel, Katerina the Deceived, Lara the Vengeful, Yulia the Unbeliever, Anna the Egotist, Aspity the Heathen, and Rubin the Oathbreaker. They will survive in order to die and upon dying they will claim life everlasting. I need them for the miracle to work.

Remember that.

<string id="533587"><![CDATA[You are correct—I am willing to admit it, as you can see. Were I not absolutely positive that my father is innocent, I would have never confessed to it even though we share a mutual distaste for one another. Father needed Isidor. He was of much use to him. And that is the ultimate argument in my father's favour.]]></string>
<string id="533588"><![CDATA[Was he useful as a healer?]]></string>
<string id="533589"><![CDATA[Well, the Olgimskys weren't exactly delighted with Isidor, were they?]]></string>
<string id="533590"><![CDATA[Isidor came by to see you last night. Don't try to deny it.]]></string>
<string id="533591"><![CDATA[...So what if he did?]]></string>
<string id="533592"><![CDATA[What were you two talking about?]]></string>
<string id="533593"><![CDATA[I am also aware of what you two have been talking about. All I want to know is why he left to see Simon afterwards.]]></string>
<string id="533594"><![CDATA[Business, my curious friend… Purely business… I have no interest in… other subjects. And it has nothing to do with you. And with that I bid you… The door's behind you, the big one.]]></string>
<string id="533595"><![CDATA[I'll find out the truth anyway.]]></string>
<string id="533596"><![CDATA[Oh my, oh my… Pray forgive me… So he wanted to bring me to heel, that traitor, that bastard… Well, what he asked for was for me to stop the factory! How could I not kick him out?]]></string>
<string id="533597"><![CDATA[What were his reasons?]]></string>
<string id="533598"><![CDATA[His reasons… huh? The bastard! He reasoned he'd pay a visit to my daughter—he knows full well how to pull my strings! Well, I told her to lock the door, so away he went none the wiser… Oh the bastard… So he went to Simon, huh? Thank goodness my loafer of a son is hanging around somewhere... Or else... hm... he could have...]]></string>
<string id="533599"><![CDATA[Could have what?]]></string>
<string id="533600"><![CDATA[Huh? That, my dear and respectable friend, is none of your business. My property, like I said, is in order. See the skin and meat delivery reports. Do you know how hard… No way! It's my domain, whether anyone riots or not. And I'll have my way with them!]]></string>
<string id="533601"><![CDATA[I see, I see. You're the big guy here.]]></string>
<string id="533602"><![CDATA[I'll find everything out eventually.]]></string>
<string id="533603"><![CDATA[What did he tell you? Who else could he have spoken to? Perhaps someone who could take measures… of what kind?]]></string>
<string id="533604"><![CDATA[What have they run away from? A jail? A bedlam? Or a zoo, judging by their appearance...]]></string>
<string id="533605"><![CDATA[The Olgimskys have closed the Termitary again! And those who have managed to escape from there are now being hunted. Capella told me all about this. Some of them have ran away and some went into hiding somewhere in the town. And Capella is worried…]]></string>
<string id="533606"><![CDATA[What is she worried about?]]></string>
<string id="533607"><![CDATA[Capella and Vlad the Younger are poles apart. Vlad's primary concern is the interests of the family. So the sister is worried that the brother will kill the runaway. She'd rather have him survive the night and escape into the Steppe...]]></string>

<string id="533609"><![CDATA[The ones that made a fire in our backyard. They were coughing, croaking, and groaning at sunrise, remember?]]></string>

<string id="533611"><![CDATA[Who is Capella?]]></string>
<string id="533612"><![CDATA[Big Vlad's daughter. A beloved daughter, too. She is wonderful... and has these abilities... The children follow her as if they were charmed, just like they followed that piper. Well, she said she wanted to save the fugitive from her family's wrath.]]></string>

<string id="533614"><![CDATA[Tell me, Eva, what are the ruins outside your window? Is it the Stairway to Heaven?]]></string>
<string id="533615"><![CDATA[It's on the other side of the Guzzle—this ruin is the one that's closer to the Theatre. It looks better from the second floor.]]></string>
<string id="533616"><![CDATA[What are these ruins? They look ancient, but the construction is recent...]]></string>
<string id="533617"><![CDATA[Thank you. That's precisely what I wanted to know.]]></string>
<string id="533618"><![CDATA[Oh... That's an old dream of the Stamatins. They are architects, you know. They wanted to overcome the force of gravity. These ruins were a kind of an attempt to do so... They were built by the Peter Stamatin. Can you imagine, they still live here! Still haven't gone back home to the Capital!]]></string>
<string id="533619"><![CDATA[Who are they? I think I've heard the name… Could you please tell me, if that's not too long a story?]]></string>
<string id="533620"><![CDATA[It will take as long as you want it to—although one can talk about them for hours. Where should I start? They are brilliant architects. They've built something famous in the Capital... that three-storied garden of frozen springs... Does it ring a bell?]]></string>
<string id="533621"><![CDATA[The Cold Hall?]]></string>
<string id="533622"><![CDATA[Yeah! Cold Hall! I haven't seen it, but they say it's unbelievable... And it was they that have built the Polyhedron.]]></string>
<string id="533623"><![CDATA[The Polyhedron is that tower on the other side of the river, right?]]></string>
<string id="533624"><![CDATA[Really! They died, didn't they?]]></string>
<string id="533625"><![CDATA[No! They moved here to build the Polyhedron and have been living here since then—it's been almost ten years now... They stayed for Mistress Nina.]]></string>
<string id="533626"><![CDATA[The Polyhedron is that tower on the other side of the river, right?]]></string>
<string id="533627"><![CDATA[Unbelievable! I'll pay them a visit. They are people of my kind anyhow...]]></string>
<string id="533628"><![CDATA[Yeah! "The New Quarter" or "The Specular Tower" they call it. Do you like it?]]></string>
<string id="533629"><![CDATA[How does it stand? How is it supported?]]></string>
<string id="533630"><![CDATA[Unbelievable...]]></string>
<string id="533631"><![CDATA[I have no idea! That's the mystery. Everyone says it's impossible.]]></string>
<string id="533632"><![CDATA[A miracle...]]></string>
<string id="533633"><![CDATA[A crazy building...]]></string>
<string id="533634"><![CDATA[Yes! A real miracle. The only real miracle of all that I've seen. The only miracle so real that you can touch it with your hand. Well, besides you, of course...]]></string>
<string id="533635"><![CDATA[Okay, okay, I only wanted to know more about the ruins. I need them as a reference point.]]></string>
<string id="533636"><![CDATA[Hah…! Nah, don't compare me to that monstrous construct.]]></string>
<string id="533637"><![CDATA[The Cold Hall... Pretty and modern, but it's nothing special. Although experts say it's a breakthrough.]]></string>
<string id="533638"><![CDATA[Right. I am going to ask you one more question now. Your answer will determine whether you and I become friends or enemies.]]></string>
<string id="533639"><![CDATA[...Well then. I'd rather be your friend. Go ahead.]]></string>
<string id="533640"><![CDATA[What did you talk about? Tell me the truth please.]]></string>
<string id="533641"><![CDATA[.....Isidor said... Note that I'm merely retelling it second-hand! He said there's an epidemic in the steppe camps. An outbreak of tarbagan sickness, perhaps… the plague, that is. Father… Father had issued an order to lock the Termitary up to prevent the infection from getting in.]]></string>
<string id="533642"><![CDATA[And what are you so afraid of that you would conceal this? I don't understand. You did the right thing.]]></string>
<string id="533643"><![CDATA[That is because that would make you betray your father, isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="533644"><![CDATA[...Yes. Seems it's better to put the cards on the table with you.]]></string>
<string id="533645"><![CDATA[So far you're coming across as a very smart person.]]></string>
<string id="533646"><![CDATA[You've talked to my father already. What do you know?]]></string>
<string id="533647"><![CDATA[Whatever. I'll outplay you anyway.]]></string>
<string id="533648"><![CDATA[Everything. Almost everything. All I want to know is where you come into play.]]></string>
<string id="533649"><![CDATA[Nothing, but I am counting on your... yes, your conscience. I'll find the whole truth out anyway—sooner rather than later.]]></string>
<string id="533650"><![CDATA[There is an underlying sensitive family matter here. To cut a long story short, my father would kill me if he found out about this conversation… The unrest in the Termitary, you see… well, I incited it to make father lock it up. He didn't believe Isidor.]]></string>
<string id="533651"><![CDATA[I see... Now everything makes sense.]]></string>
<string id="533652"><![CDATA[...We need to warn Rubin, it's very urgent! He is about to examine Simon as soon as the period of time required by the Kains passes. But where is he? I have no idea…]]></string>
<string id="533653"><![CDATA[Where is he staying?]]></string>
<string id="533654"><![CDATA[What do you think was the cause of Simon Kain's death? Especially taking into account the fact that Isidor Burakh had been his last visitor.]]></string>
<string id="533655"><![CDATA[Do you think Isidor had already been infected when he spoke with you?]]></string>
<string id="533656"><![CDATA[He was wrapped in a cloth and smelled of alcohol. He said these were preventative measures. But I still think he could have done all that just to convince me… after failing to convince my father. It was idiotic of me to fall for it!]]></string>
<string id="533657"><![CDATA[But why?]]></string>
<string id="533658"><![CDATA[So he could have already been infected when he visited Simon?]]></string>
<string id="533659"><![CDATA[To stage a coup in the Kin! Isidor had resigned from internal Kin business a long time ago… and he passed his share of patriarchal power—and this power is very special, it's sacred like the power of a housefather… and his power used to be considerable… anyway, he passed it onto another person. Isidor has only been healing since then.]]></string>
<string id="533660"><![CDATA[And now he decided to come back and let Simon know straight away, right? And if the rumours of the plague are true...]]></string>
<string id="533661"><![CDATA[I'd check every warehouse, of course. Perhaps I'd find something…]]></string>
<string id="533662"><![CDATA[Oh, your beauty is only matched by your intelligence. You know how to push my buttons. Are you really a sorceress?]]></string>
<string id="533663"><![CDATA[...What in the world is going on here? Are you trying to flirt with me?]]></string>
<string id="533664"><![CDATA[Yes, I'm on my last legs too.]]></string>
<string id="533665"><![CDATA[Why are you still up then? Go to bed if your head hurts so much.]]></string>
<string id="533666"><![CDATA[Okay, I'll come by around noon.]]></string>
<string id="533667"><![CDATA[Wait a second... the uni? Were it you juggling knives on the table?]]></string>
<string id="533668"><![CDATA[Ah! Remember the time when we got the better of those bastards, eh? And you—you sat there all quiet, but when the tables went down, you grabbed the shooter... Yeah, I remember! Very brave of you. Those were the days... And look at me now!]]></string>
<string id="533669"><![CDATA[Those were the days indeed... Dankovsky—in case you've forgotten. And you are?]]></string>
<string id="533670"><![CDATA[And you... what do you do now? I believe you left Health Science, didn't you?]]></string>
<string id="533671"><![CDATA[Do they confuse you two or something?]]></string>
<string id="533672"><![CDATA[Yeah… sounds about right.]]></string>
<string id="533692"><![CDATA[Andrey, tell me, how can I make the rulers do a reality check?]]></string>
<string id="533709"><![CDATA[Do you believe in prophecies, Andrey Stamatin? ]]></string>
<string id="533710"><![CDATA[It depends. I agree, this may seem inconsistent with materialism. On the other hand, when your own experience convinces you to their effectiveness, you have to take them into account. Have you been foretold something?]]></string>
<string id="533711"><![CDATA[The day before yesterday Katerina foretold my untimely death.]]></string>
<string id="533712"><![CDATA[Katerina is not talentless. That means you will die sooner or later. Nothing to be done about it.]]></string>
<string id="533713"><![CDATA[Spoken like a true optimist.]]></string>
<string id="533714"><![CDATA[Uh huh. I didn't take her words seriously either. ]]></string>
<string id="533715"><![CDATA[But you should have, Bachelor Dankovsky. Katerina pales in comparison with the Mistresses of old, there's no denying that; but the gift is in her blood. Do beware. Had Katerina foretold me that I was about to die unless I abandon twiryne, I'd be off the bottle immediately.]]></string>
<string id="533716"><![CDATA[I can foretell you that without any bloodgifts.]]></string>
<string id="533717"><![CDATA[No. But I never expected that I'd be listening to the prophecies of a municipal executive.]]></string>
<string id="533718"><![CDATA[Who are you calling executives?]]></string>
<string id="533719"><![CDATA[I meant the Saburovs. ]]></string>
<string id="533720"><![CDATA[The Saburovs are a double blunder. We don't have executives in this town. We have rulers, genuine and false. So hear me out: I, Andrey Stamatin, hereby declare that this town can have no ruler but Simon Kain!]]></string>
<string id="533721"><![CDATA[Simon is dead.]]></string>
<string id="533722"><![CDATA[No! Simon is alive until the murderer has been found. This town needs autocracy. It's time for the triumvirate to go down the drain.]]></string>
<string id="533723"><![CDATA[I sincerely hope these words will stay within the walls of the pub.]]></string>
<string id="533734"><![CDATA[A girl named Anna Angel lives in the neighbourhood. Is she the Angel of "Thunderstorm" fame?]]></string>
<string id="533735"><![CDATA[No, that was another one... Also called Angel, yeah. Do you think Anna is a singer? Ha! No one has ever heard her sing—because she's not a singer at all. She's hiding from the Powers That Be here—and any noise scares her shitless.]]></string>
<string id="533736"><![CDATA[What was the crime? ]]></string>
<string id="533737"><![CDATA[She claims to be a political case. But really, look at her—does she really look like she belongs to the underground? She has nothing to do with the February revolt. Although… when there's smoke, there's fire. I think the sweet girl used to serve as a cover for the Ace of Diamonds Caravan. And if my guess is right, I wonder what her position was. We're all monsters here, see? A town of freaks... eh?]]></string>
<string id="533738"><![CDATA["Ace of Diamonds"... There was a Guignol play about it... "The Theatre of Death", right?]]></string>
<string id="533739"><![CDATA[Right, the Caravan. Don't you remember? The kidnapping story? The accusation of thimbleriggers… have you forgotten that orgy in the Capital? They started killing street performers on sight. Our own Mark Immortell ended up on the run.]]></string>
<string id="533740"><![CDATA[Who is Mark Immortell?]]></string>
<string id="533741"><![CDATA[The director of our Theatre. A genius puppet-master. He also directs Masks. You should take a look. It's in the Marrow, on Spin-a-Yarn Square.]]></string>
<string id="533742"><![CDATA[I'd like to know more about the local Theatre… if you haven't drunk your tongue out, that is.]]></string>
<string id="533743"><![CDATA[Immortell has dug out some ritual masks of an ancient Steppe cult. Now he's having fun with them—and with himself. Claims that the local mimes can tell the future. As for me, I think he's making fun of the Mistresses—and, by extension, of us all. A motley buffoon.]]></string>
<string id="533744"><![CDATA[A buffoon, huh... that has mastered the art of puppeteering. Curious.]]></string>
<string id="533745"><![CDATA[I will.]]></string>
<string id="533746"><![CDATA[I see. ]]></string>
<string id="533747"><![CDATA[No, this cannot be. I don't believe a girl is capable of such atrocities.]]></string>
<string id="533748"><![CDATA[Sometimes girls are capable of the things that even someone as bloodthirsty as me couldn't have invented.]]></string>
<string id="533749"><![CDATA[Perhaps... But it still doesn't sound right.]]></string>
<string id="533750"><![CDATA[What would you say about Maria? ]]></string>
<string id="533751"><![CDATA[Maria? I'd say that the brilliance of her talent is going to surpass even Nina's one day. Maria will be grabbing stars by the handful while sipping earth's magma. I'm putting great hopes in her! And please note that I seriously mean it. Not a hint of irony in my voice.]]></string>
<string id="533752"><![CDATA[What's the nature of her talent then?]]></string>
<string id="533753"><![CDATA[Every Kain possesses this gift—the ability to see the unseen and achieve the unachievable. This art doesn't have a name because very few people have mastered it. Maria is concealing her true power for the time being, but it has already become apparent that she will stop at nothing when the time comes. Her sheer power will justify any despotism that would spring from it.]]></string>
<string id="533754"><![CDATA[Are you talking about her fortune-telling abilities?]]></string>
<string id="533755"><![CDATA[Why are you all so obsessed with fortune-telling? You can't tell a person's fortune; it is a common man's delight. Although you definitely can catch a glimpse of the fortune of the people too weak to fight for it! Man is the sole architect of his fortune. No, I'm talking about the ability to drag the things that are naturally subtle and covert into the daylight!]]></string>
<string id="533756"><![CDATA[The Kains can do that too?]]></string>
<string id="533757"><![CDATA[Yeah, sure, please find the certificate verifying their dragging-into-the-daylight talents attached to their wall! It's no fucking child's play! Not a trade that allows to start a small hole-in-the-wall business. If you need illustrative magic tricks, go to the Theatre!]]></string>
<string id="533758"><![CDATA[Makes sense. No need to get so angry.]]></string>
<string id="533759"><![CDATA[Too bad.]]></string>
<string id="533760"><![CDATA[Amazing. Are you saying that there are records of each of the Kains displaying these abilities?]]></string>
<string id="533761"><![CDATA[Well, technically that's impossible.]]></string>
<string id="533762"><![CDATA[Andrey, what's your opinion of Victor Kain? ]]></string>
<string id="533763"><![CDATA[Victor is a natural born ruler; he could be doing it all by himself. It's Victor, not Georgiy, who is Simon's true heir. But he wants to leave this place to further his education and get a degree. Treachery, if you ask me.]]></string>
<string id="533764"><![CDATA[Aren't you being too harsh on him?]]></string>
<string id="533765"><![CDATA[Not at all. The Kains may seem like unpredictable petty tyrants—but we have them to thank for that horrendous civil war passing our town by! The Powers That Be… Can't you see? Instead of building a utopia in this wreck of a country, they're tearing the last scraps of the good that had been done by their predecessors into even smaller scraps. Do you think it's easy to make a stand in a situation like this?]]></string>
<string id="533766"><![CDATA[Still can't see what Victor has to do with it.]]></string>
<string id="533767"><![CDATA[Somehow—and I can only explain it with sorcery—Simon was able to redirect the games that the Powers That Be play away from our modest town. They never paid attention to us, never violated us, never touched us at all—and the town flourished. Victor was a good disciple to Simon. He'll manage to renew his achievement. Georgiy won't.]]></string>
<string id="533768"><![CDATA[Then why hasn't Victor left yet?]]></string>
<string id="533769"><![CDATA[His love for Maria is holding him back—he sees Nina's ghost in her, after all… I can relate, too. Living in the town where everything reminds you of her is unbearable. But I'd rather see him grab the power and compel the town to make another turn, bringing it upwards.]]></string>
<string id="533770"><![CDATA[It'll all work out in the end.]]></string>
<string id="533771"><![CDATA[How about another drink?]]></string>
<string id="533772"><![CDATA[Is that why your brother and you are still living here? ]]></string>

<string id="533783"><![CDATA[Grace... ah! The corpse-lover's daughter… What is there to tell? The daughter of the caretaker of the cemetery; he used to drink like a fish and got his baby girl addicted to twyrine too. Driven her mother to an early grave and would have driven the daughter too, had he not died of that shit himself.]]></string>
<string id="533784"><![CDATA[He offered her twyrine since she was a child? ]]></string>
<string id="533785"><![CDATA[Uh huh. She's not much of a talker. The dead offer her company more often than the living. She used to look after the graves since she was a child—and that obviously messed with her little head. She's a guardian spirit of the local cemetery, just like the Mother Superior is the guardian spirit of the Termitary.]]></string>

<string id="533787"><![CDATA[Who is the Mother Superior?]]></string>
<string id="533788"><![CDATA[The daughter of the commandant. She is like an ant queen of the whole dosshouse. Rumour has it, the monsters tend to her every need, spoonfeeding the girl. I'd like to have a look…]]></string>

<string id="533790"><![CDATA[The Mother Superior? Are you sure we're talking about the same Termitary?]]></string>
<string id="533791"><![CDATA[There's only one Termitary in the town. Well, two, actually, but they are two halves of a single nutshell. A gigantic dosshouse that had put its roots down into the Abattoir. Just go a bit further to the east. It was built after a huge fire that had destroyed the local settlement... Do take a look, I'd like to hear all about your impressions—that's some masterpiece, huh? That's what the architecture was like half a century ago! And in some places it still is! An abomination...]]></string>

To fall in love with it, you have to have a vivid imagination... and a huge heart.]]></string>
<string id="534004"><![CDATA[Eva qualifies, I take it.]]></string>

<string id="534021"><![CDATA[Is that a bad thing?]]></string>
<string id="534022"><![CDATA[It doesn't matter. Whatever Maria does, she deserves to have any sin absolved—if only for the sheer fact that she begets true magic. And if the price of it are her insane escapades, so be it. We'll make do.]]></string>

And yet she rendered complete obedience to Victor, even though he never asked for it.]]></string>
<string id="534027"><![CDATA[So what's your point?]]></string>
<string id="534028"><![CDATA[Exactly. It's mysterious. How did he manage to bring this demon to his heel—and why did he allow her absolute freedom of choice? Basically, Victor is hiding something. I think he's waiting for Georgiy to make an unpopular move to finally show his real face. Just kidding.]]></string>

<string id="534041"><![CDATA[Of course I do. Where force is useless, talent saves the day. One has to admit we are lucky to have commanders like that; worthy heirs of the heroic era. If Shoin breaks through on the southern front and Block moves out to meet him near Orlog... chances are that the war will be over soon.]]></string>
<string id="534042"><![CDATA[Block's army is in tatters. I heard he barely has any units left that are fit for combat...]]></string>
<string id="534043"><![CDATA[Yes, and that is because those bastards at the HQ have been using him as cover. They throw him at the most hopeless operations and try to kill two birds with one stone—delivering a crippling blow to the enemy and getting rid of the hero! Heroes have always been an inconvenience to the Powers That Be.]]></string>

<string id="534049"><![CDATA[It's all right, though. Both Shoin and Block have always fought against superior numbers, and yet Shoin has always been victorious. Block was greatly outnumbered at the Karstov Fords, but…]]></string>
<string id="534050"><![CDATA[Yes, that battle will be in the annals of the art of war.]]></string>

<string id="534056"><![CDATA[Really? Well, that means you'd make a wonderful inquisitor—a better than one than me, perhaps. It only dawned on me how unfortunate a role I am to play in this mission on my way here. Miraculously. Here's my first question then: what for did they hatch this plan?]]></string>
<string id="534057"><![CDATA[Erm... I apologize. I'll do my best not to interrupt you from now on.]]></string>

<string id="534079"><![CDATA[There you are, Bachelor! I've been waiting for you, waiting to reveal to you… nobody else knows this secret… and I'd never tell them. Who else could I reveal it to but you, the man that only came here for its sake… You know what I'm talking about, don't you? Who I am talking about?]]></string>
<string id="534080"><![CDATA[Well... Simon? ]]></string>
<string id="534081"><![CDATA[I beg you on my knees… Go to him… see for yourself that he is alive… and let the Inquisitor rend the Kains to pieces… Aglaya will be happy, because the only good thing in her is her hatred of the Kains!]]></string>
<string id="534082"><![CDATA[Is that so? I didn't know that.]]></string>
<string id="534083"><![CDATA[Well, now you do. Oh, how generously shall she reward you for the news… for exposing the villains… on the eve of everyone's doom… a truly heroic deed… so why won't you do it? I ask for so little…]]></string>
<string id="534084"><![CDATA[I was going to visit the Crucible anyway. Perhaps there really is no smoke without fire.]]></string>

<string id="534092"><![CDATA[They let me go. But it can't be… Georgiy was supposed to put me to death…]]></string>
<string id="534093"><![CDATA[Why would he have put you to death? ]]></string>
<string id="534094"><![CDATA[…It's all true. I broke Simon down into particles. Anything that couldn't be used to make the vaccine, I burned. There is no mistake. Can't you see; only that wondrous organism could produce the white vaccine—the one that's still keeping hundreds of people alive. I give you my word.]]></string>
<string id="534095"><![CDATA[Very well. Then my path takes me to the Crucible once again. Just as nine days ago… when your Master directed me there.]]></string>

<string id="534103"><![CDATA[What's going on with you? This is not how you normally talk.]]></string>
<string id="534104"><![CDATA[Ask. I shall answer as clearly as I can. Do you know why ghosts always speak in riddles? It used to puzzle me—after all, I've never felt compelled to resort to allegory in order to draw conclusions from my visions. Now I know the answer. Their consciousness is fragmented.]]></string>
<string id="534105"><![CDATA[You mean he must himself agree that I paint him as insane?]]></string>
<string id="534106"><![CDATA[Yes. Go to him. Talking to him will open your eyes to the truth. You are a perceptive man, after all. Help us. Such rumours would be very inopportune. And please accept some money. It will be of use in shutting up a few particularly big mouths.]]></string>
<string id="534107"><![CDATA[And accept I will. I hear the words of a person born to rule. I'm doubly grateful that this power has nothing to do with me.]]></string>

<string id="534112"><![CDATA[The truth about Simon Kain is the kind of truth that may only be explained to those ready to accept it. They want to know what happened to his body? Very well. Simon Kain was afflicted with the Sand Plague. His body has been torn into droplets and fibers. It's a pity that we now cannot produce his remains before the non-believers. What are they to find comfort in now?]]></string>
<string id="534113"><![CDATA[…But that's not true, is it?]]></string>
<string id="534114"><![CDATA[Not entirely true, but true enough to satisfy a vigorous mind like hers. Temporary lives will depart so that the eternal lives will be reborn. Go now, my boy. You are no mystic after all.]]></string>
<string id="534115"><![CDATA[I shall fulfil your request.]]></string>
<string id="534116"><![CDATA[Farewell. I am glad that I did in the end have the chance to meet you.]]></string>
<string id="534117"><![CDATA[Have you already been told about the Kains? ]]></string>
<string id="534118"><![CDATA[God… These days I'm told about nothing but the Kains. Or do you mean something really special?]]></string>

<string id="534120"><![CDATA["Chimerae: The Kains' Madness"]]></string>
<string id="534121"><![CDATA[According to Katerina, Simon Kain has returned to the Crucible. She swears she can feel his presence! How is this even possible? Did she transport herself completely into the world of her chimeras? Only Rubin can answer that. He was the last person to see Simon alive.]]></string>
<string id="534122"><![CDATA[Rubin gave me his word that Simon Kain no longer exists. He claims to have burnt every particle of Simon's body that was not processed to create the vaccine. In this case the answer is to be found in the Crucible. Let the Kains themselves explain what is going on there.]]></string>
<string id="534123"><![CDATA[Something strange is happening here. Everything I see in the Crucible bears a trace of insanity. Victor says I should trust Georgiy when he tells me of his own madness. But is it even remotely plausible that a madman would corroborate his own condition? Not at all. What is it then?]]></string>
<string id="534124"><![CDATA[Georgiy is free of any mental disease. However... This is not the same Georgiy I knew. Something has changed. Is this some kind of a game? Or does he genuinely believe he is his own brother? Perhaps he is misled by an ill-conceived sense of moral obligation? Aglaya Lilich is the last oasis of reason amidst all this madness. I should tell her about Georgiy's request.]]></string>
<string id="534125"><![CDATA[*** I shouldn't have put my trust in Aglaya. Contrary to what I expected, the conversation with her did not set me at ease. In her eyes I caught a glimpse of the strange flame that was illuminating Victor's gaze as we spoke. Did someone say they were related? I think I am going insane as well.]]></string>

<string id="534149"><![CDATA[Indeed! A truly smart decision. And kind of elegant, too. It's a professional prejudice of mine—I've never viewed an armed crowd as a tool. I, the master of manipulation! You can simply say it's a sanitary hazard—and it will be burned… Although I'm afraid that won't be the end of it...]]></string>

<string id="534224"><![CDATA[What can you tell me about Mark Immortell?]]></string>
<string id="534225"><![CDATA[I don't fancy the bright lad. Sure, he's got swift hands. Perhaps his masks do tell fortune. These are lang syne after all, the high culture. Still, his performances give me the creeps.]]></string>
<string id="534226"><![CDATA[Tell me more about those performances.]]></string>
<string id="534227"><![CDATA[You see, there must be somethnig fishy about it! They say they tell your fortune, right? Might be just a game, might be not; it does come true. I think though that it's Mark himself who manipulates the events to align someone's life with his ideas. Get it?]]></string>
<string id="534228"><![CDATA[So do the predictions come true or don't they?]]></string>
<string id="534229"><![CDATA[I mean, they do come true, though not every time, and if they don't, he explains it away as a metaphor, or says they did come true but we didn't notice. How can you catch someone like that lying? He's always got the answer.]]></string>
<string id="534230"><![CDATA[Well, that's an occupational hazard.]]></string>

<string id="534253"><![CDATA[Like the back of my hand… the son of a bitch!]]></string>
<string id="534254"><![CDATA[Whoa, you're harsh on that one. Something personal?]]></string>
<string id="534255"><![CDATA[They're all sons of bitches, these thieves! Beastly monsters, especially the ones from the Steppe. They're always drunk on twyrine, they stalk the place like evil souls of this hellish herb. They cross someone's hand with silver, I can even guess whose hand it is… I won't name names though.]]></string>
<string id="534256"><![CDATA[Why are you living by their side then?]]></string>
<string id="534257"><![CDATA[Why, would you prefer to send us orphans to live in the Steppe? We don't get to pick a place. Let the ones who banished us here be ashamed! If it were up to us, we'd be in the Polyhedron now with all the others. For now, though, here we are, under the thugs' nose.]]></string>
<string id="534258"><![CDATA[And who was it that banished you here?]]></string>
<string id="534259"><![CDATA[This, doctor, is none of your business. Have you killed Simon's killer yet? Chop-chop, time's running out…]]></string>
<string id="534260"><![CDATA[You watch your tongue…]]></string>
<string id="534261"><![CDATA[Point taken.]]></string>

<string id="534263"><![CDATA[How do the rulers tolerate them?]]></string>
<string id="534264"><![CDATA[How could they not? Those guys are officialy storekeepers, their own masters. Railway men. The Warehouses are owned by the railway, as it happens. And railways are none of our concern; they were built by the Powers that Be. It's their dominion. Also, the thieves are sort of living by themselves. With a proper share of smuggling too. I know everything about them...]]></string>

<string id="534268"><![CDATA[Ha! "Bad luck"... Are you completely mental?]]></string>
<string id="534269"><![CDATA[I've been told that this is the place where this, y'know, sort of tongue comes out of the ground, a tongue made of dirty lumps. Like made of thick air... You're standing at that exact spot, sir.]]></string>
<string id="534270"><![CDATA[You go home at once! You're grounded!]]></string>
<string id="534271"><![CDATA[I can't. I gave a promise. It would be a disgrace to my honour!]]></string>
<string id="534272"><![CDATA[I will if you leave at once. And give me the shmowder.]]></string>
<string id="534273"><![CDATA[Cut it! Good kinds do not tell lies. Give me the thing and get out of here.]]></string>
<string id="534274"><![CDATA[Run back to your crowd and tell them that I've banned the test since shmowders are deadly rather than curative. I'll testify that you stood your ground until the very end.]]></string>
<string id="534275"><![CDATA[All right. I suppose I'm in no position to argue... But you will confirm what really happened here, right? If anyone asks?]]></string>
<string id="534276"><![CDATA[Give it to me. I'll test it myself.]]></string>
<string id="534277"><![CDATA[You know what? Hell if I care. Do whatever you please.]]></string>
<string id="534279"><![CDATA[I'm looking for Barley, the leader of the barbers. Do you know where his hideout could be?]]></string>
<string id="534280"><![CDATA[Nah... I tried to sniff around, but no luck. Notkin's Soul-and-a-Halves tracked him down though. They've got dogs, which helps with tracking.]]></string>
<string id="534281"><![CDATA[Will Notkin tell me?]]></string>
<string id="534282"><![CDATA[No way. No use even trying. The Soul-and-a-Halves want to finish the barbers off themselves and take full credit for it. That's, like, a matter of life and death for Notkin. A chance to crush every possible competition—both Grief and Khan—and a chance to show off in front of the Mother Superior. He's doing it for her.]]></string>
<string id="534283"><![CDATA[That's a shame…]]></string>
<string id="534284"><![CDATA[But I think I know how to trick them.]]></string>
<string id="534285"><![CDATA[Tell me.]]></string>
<string id="534286"><![CDATA[The Soul-and-a-Halves are staking out the house where Barley's hiding. They keep coming and going there. You can follow one of them or one of their dogs. Just hang around their Castle a bit; they'll be sending a runner to the post soon enough. Just make sure to be stealthy—if they spot you, they'll make sure to lead you away.]]></string>
<string id="534287"><![CDATA[Thank you for the advice.]]></string>
<string id="534288"><![CDATA[This request does you credit. I was certain you would ask for yourself. ]]></string>
<string id="534290"><![CDATA[I haven't finished yet... Apart from that, I wish they stopped... torturing me about the Termitary. I'm tired of repeating that it's clean. That is why it was closed in the first place. ]]></string>
<string id="534291"><![CDATA[You know what? You've just suggested an excellent idea to me. How about this: you stop the persecution—and I'll kindly spare the Kains my opinion on what's inside the Termirary?]]></string>
<string id="534292"><![CDATA[This won't happen before I closely examine the Termitary myself. So, unfortunately, we are unlikely to find a compromise, boös Vlad. Farewell. ]]></string>
<string id="534293"><![CDATA[For goodness' sake... If you put it like this... Yes, certainly... certainly... I was going to... as well... It's no matter now... Now that the Skinners is infected—just like the Crude Sprawl before it... You have my word as a merchant. The thing is—I know you as a man of honour. Damn it... ]]></string>
<string id="534294"><![CDATA[I'm glad we have an agreement, boös Vlad. The word of a merchant provides a reliable assurance.]]></string>
<string id="534295"><![CDATA[Do keep in mind that you've given yourself away more than I could have ever expected!]]></string>
<string id="534299"><![CDATA[I want to settle the dispute between us and the Kains concerning our unwillingness to let emissaries into the Termitary. I don't know what the Kains are thinking, but we are not harbouring anything or anyone there that could be of even remote interest to them—especially to my deeply esteemed fellow Victor.]]></string>
<string id="534300"><![CDATA[So why don't you let the inspectors in?]]></string>
<string id="534301"><![CDATA[First of all, it's dangerous. The rabble is rioting. I've told you about that more than once already. Secondly, father will not submit to the younger Kain's orders. If this keeps up, we'll soon be taking orders from his ten-year-old son!]]></string>
<string id="534302"><![CDATA[I'm doing this not on the Kains' orders, but at their request. And I act on my authority, not theirs.]]></string>
<string id="534303"><![CDATA[Sounds… elaborate. Very well then. I'll give you one more reason to keep the Termitary closed for as long as possible. Frankly speaking, it's you who should have prohibited us from letting anyone in there—even yourself. It's your direct duty.]]></string>
<string id="534304"><![CDATA[You mean quarantining the place?]]></string>
<string id="534305"><![CDATA[Exactly. Fortunately, we locked the Termitary off a day before the Sand Dirt came to our town. Should the Kains insist, I have an argument that will easily convince both them and you. You require proof of the veracity of my words too, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="534306"><![CDATA[I'm listening.]]></string>
<string id="534307"><![CDATA[The Kains are hiding something too… They have their own skeleton in the closet, and it's even more unsightly than ours. Our closet is full of our own workers; theirs is full of other people's children. If you can make sure that… everything is well inside the Polyhedron, then trust me, the Termitary is fine too. It's an enclave. A closed chamber.]]></string>
<string id="534308"><![CDATA[So you believe that quarantine will be effective in keeping the infection out of that giant bunkhouse?]]></string>
<string id="534309"><![CDATA[Certainly. Did you not say yourself—at least that's how it was relayed to me—that walls are a solid defense? Besides, think of what will happen if ten thousand people pour into the streets in search of food and gossip. Try to imagine the picture.]]></string>
<string id="534310"><![CDATA[Sounds convincing. I'll inspect the Polyhedron and talk to Victor, but I'll ask a favour of you in return: help me find Simon's body.]]></string>
<string id="534311"><![CDATA[Try to curb the righteous anger of the Judge and the terrible Victor; they seem to have finally decided to harass my father to death. I have no doubt that no matter what he did, it's not his fault. If you do that, I will gladly assist you.]]></string>
<string id="534312"><![CDATA[Deal.]]></string>
<string id="534313"><![CDATA[I'm doing this for the Kains… but I doubt that my success here can infringe upon your family's interests.]]></string>
<string id="534314"><![CDATA[Was the Polyhedron closed after the Termitary? ]]></string>
<string id="534315"><![CDATA[And it was much closer to the original source of the plague. To Simon Kain.]]></string>
<string id="534316"><![CDATA[Sounds convincing. I'll inspect the Polyhedron and talk to Victor, but I'll ask a favour of you in return: help me find Simon's body.]]></string>
<string id="534317"><![CDATA[Very well. Let's have it that way. I want to help.]]></string>
<string id="534318"><![CDATA[What would you ask in return? ]]></string>
<string id="534319"><![CDATA[Nothing much. The information concerning the disappearance of Simon Kain's body—specifically the place where Rubin could have taken it.]]></string>
<string id="534335"><![CDATA[You must have already noticed that anyone's chances to escape the epidemic unscathed are rather low. I can increase theirs.]]></string>
<string id="534363"><![CDATA[*** I cannot change the mind of this man! Let them sort their own business! I'd better have someone else take care of Rubin's affairs.]]></string>
<string id="534364"><![CDATA[This is some invaluable information, Bachelor; I am much obliged. I will allow Rubin a chance to explain himself before the day ends... perhaps there was nothing else he could do under the circumstances. Nevertheless, the reward I was going to pay for any information concerning Simon's whereabouts is rightfully yours to claim.]]></string>
<string id="534365"><![CDATA[Thank you. ]]></string>
<string id="534366"><![CDATA[I don't need anything.]]></string>
<string id="534367"><![CDATA[Just don't bring the body directly to The Crucible and don't forget to quarantine your people before they return to their everyday duties.]]></string>
<string id="534368"><![CDATA[Is that what you think?]]></string>
<string id="534369"><![CDATA[He's known about the infection for a long time. We just agreed to keep it secret.]]></string>
<string id="534370"><![CDATA[Why should I? ]]></string>
<string id="534376"><![CDATA[Most curious! What is it?]]></string>
<string id="534377"><![CDATA[Vlad the Younger asked me to tell you the following: the Termitary had been closed before the Polyhedron was, and there are many witnesses to that.]]></string>
<string id="534378"><![CDATA[Really? What is he getting at?]]></string>
<string id="534379"><![CDATA[He has no reason to believe that the situation inside the Termitary is different from that inside the Tower. ]]></string>
<string id="534380"><![CDATA[My son has now founded a kingdom of his own. There it is, towering above our sinful earth. He wouldn't let anyone into that world—not even his own father. If you're interested to know what's going on there, give it a try. Maria thinks you're a man for whom nothing is impossible.]]></string>
<string id="534381"><![CDATA[Yes. I'll follow your advice. ]]></string>
<string id="534382"><![CDATA[I, too, have long been interested in what's going on inside that place. ]]></string>
<string id="534383"><![CDATA[I'm just relaying his words to you.]]></string>
<string id="534384"><![CDATA[I'm the one who's listening, boy. Tell me about this structure.]]></string>
<string id="534385"><![CDATA[Yes. I suppose it's enough. ]]></string>
<string id="534386"><![CDATA[It's a mystery. You won't be able to fathom it. Do you see these walls? ]]></string>
<string id="534387"><![CDATA[Yes. ]]></string>
<string id="534388"><![CDATA[I thought so. We children do not see them. There, on the left, is the coast of the New Sea. Behind you are the Cleft Islands. Behind my left shoulder—the Knot of the Five Footpaths. And the facet a little way to the left from it is actually the collapsed bridge from the legend of the Ever-Reborn.]]></string>
<string id="534389"><![CDATA[Is this some practical joke?]]></string>
<string id="534390"><![CDATA[I see now. It's a poetic allegory. You're all dreamers in here.]]></string>
<string id="534391"><![CDATA[What are the walls you see made of, Guest? ]]></string>
<string id="534392"><![CDATA[Hm... Looks like paper to me.]]></string>
<string id="534393"><![CDATA[I'm not sure... thick cardboard? ]]></string>
<string id="534394"><![CDATA[Strange. Very strange. The average thick-headed grown-up sees mirrored surfaces. It's the reason they're calling this the Specular Tower. Each person only sees an infinite series of their own reflections. That was the design.]]></string>
<string id="534395"><![CDATA[Are there really a thousand children in here? ]]></string>
<string id="534396"><![CDATA[Yes. But they're all on the other side of the facets. You can't see them, but they see you clearly. The facets are a reliable barrier.]]></string>
<string id="534397"><![CDATA[Against what? ]]></string>
<string id="534399"><![CDATA[Please do stay in.]]></string>
<string id="534400"><![CDATA[What? No, I am not getting anywhere. Just sharing my observations.]]></string>
<string id="534401"><![CDATA[Clara is with her too. The miracle-worker girl.]]></string>
<string id="534402"><![CDATA[Did she propose killing? That sounds convincing enough. Katerina has always found evil attractive.]]></string>
<string id="534403"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="534404"><![CDATA[Fifteen hundred people? How can a frail stairway support such weight?]]></string>
<string id="534405"><![CDATA[They are children. That is exactly why adults are not allowed in—the frail stairway wouldn't be able to support the weight for long... Do not worry. The Tower has been standing for a long time. It will not collapse, unless toppled deliberately and maliciously.]]></string>
<string id="534406"><![CDATA[Is it magical then?]]></string>
<string id="534407"><![CDATA[This is impossible. A utopia.]]></string>
<string id="534408"><![CDATA[This entire place is a utopia. A place that should not exist.]]></string>
<string id="534409"><![CDATA[I suppose so. Now I see why you're awed by it.]]></string>
<string id="534410"><![CDATA[Yes. This is actual magic. Doubly so, since it obeys human will.]]></string>
<string id="534411"><![CDATA[That's impossible. Miracles are always short-lived… sadly.]]></string>
<string id="534412"><![CDATA[Then I see why you're awed by it.]]></string>
<string id="534413"><![CDATA[Fine. What's your plan?]]></string>
<string id="534414"><![CDATA[Still, what does Rubin have to do with this?]]></string>
<string id="534415"><![CDATA[I'm convinced that it was those people who stole the body from him. Are you interested in finding out where they could have taken it?]]></string>
<string id="534416"><![CDATA[Absolutely.]]></string>
<string id="534417"><![CDATA[*** I commited betrayal. Rubin is in grave danger now.]]></string>
<string id="534418"><![CDATA[It's nothing too astonishing. This Tower has been standing here for more than a decade.]]></string>
<string id="534419"><![CDATA[Unbelievable... ]]></string>
<string id="534420"><![CDATA[The child speaks like a grown man. His manner leaves an impression. Could it be that Olgimsky is right? If the Termitary is protected from any external influence as diligently as this Tower is, I can exclude both buildings from my inquiry for now.]]></string>
<string id="534421"><![CDATA[I've already been there.]]></string>
<string id="534422"><![CDATA[It seems that reciprocal hatred is not in Eva's heart. My soft-mannered host wants to shelter a runaway serf from the punishment that the authorities would mete out on him if he is caught. It would appear I am not the only person chasing a criminal tonight...]]></string>
<string id="534423"><![CDATA[The younger Olgimsky exhibits a genuinely traditional kind of filial piety. Or is he pursuing some projects of his own? One way or another, he is determined to get rid of the beastlike troublemaker. I wonder what the creature—whose death has no legal consequences—looks like?]]></string>

<string id="534425"><![CDATA[You know, Saburov hates Peter; he wants to get back at him for something. I must protect him. If only Saburov seizes the power he is so hopelessly trying to obtain, Peter will be the first to stand at the Bone Stake.]]></string>

<string id="534434"><![CDATA[Disperse, all of you! Nothing to see here!]]></string>
<string id="534435"><![CDATA[And who would that be?]]></string>
<string id="534436"><![CDATA[People! Gather around—or better yet, call for your neighbours and relatives and nearest and dearest! For the meaning behind this is as follows: the Kains' tower is killing our town! The bull here represents the town. And the sharp stake, this shameful stake, is a symbol of the Kains' vile creation, their obscene philosophizing!]]></string>

<string id="534445"><![CDATA[The news that you have gone mad, Judge.]]></string>
<string id="534446"><![CDATA[Here is my final request. Tell the Inquisitor that Georgiy Kain has gone insane, and that our family is in preparation for collective suicide. That should do. Perhaps she will even leave you alone for another day or two.]]></string>
<string id="534447"><![CDATA[What in the world are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="534448"><![CDATA[Uncle is preparing to die… I am preparing to be awakened… My father… will not be here for long.]]></string>
<string id="534449"><![CDATA[Wait… Maria is related to you?]]></string>
<string id="534450"><![CDATA[Yes. The most beloved of my family. But my love is unrequited. She's prejudiced against me. I hurt her in the past, and then she was told terrible things about inquisitors. A silly childish prejudice.

<string id="534452"><![CDATA[I don't wish to force my way into a beloved person's home. I need an invitation to come in… Convince her that I mean her no harm! Or just take me to her and tell her "Here, I've brought you a new friend…" and the let me speak.]]></string>

<string id="534464"><![CDATA[The source, you mean? All the ventures up until now had one firm, yet criminal and idiotic, goal in mind—to make you look anywhere but the one place they were afraid you would find something! Why are you so sure that the source is a living person?]]></string>
<string id="534465"><![CDATA[It's in my reports. Everything adds up to confirm that hypothesis. ]]></string>
<string id="534466"><![CDATA[They did everything they could to make you think so.

<string id="534467"><![CDATA[By preventing me from finding out the truth? That's absurd!]]></string>

<string id="534483"><![CDATA[I won't. I have a thousand fellows here. Either all of us get it—or none of us does. Take it. Or give it to Olgimsky. He'll tell you all about Sister.]]></string>
<string id="534484"><![CDATA[But where did the bull come from?]]></string>

<string id="535173"><![CDATA[Why, of course… We spoke on this exact topic… I hope to convince the child of some self-evident truths. She's another vivid and interesting character in this! A medieval type, passionate, self-contradictory! It's as if she's not of our time… But that's just minutiae.]]></string>
<string id="535174"><![CDATA[Actually, I've come to inform you that they're waiting for you at the Cathedral. There's already a throng of terrified petitioners gathered…]]></string>
<string id="535175"><![CDATA[Thank you. Hopefully, I won't disappoint you.]]></string>
<string id="535176"><![CDATA[And now it's best that you leave. I'll take care of Peter.]]></string>

<string id="535179"><![CDATA[The Termitary is opened. What do you want of me? I've told you multiple times—the earth is sacred for these Steppe cannibals! You can't just bury bodies in it. They believe only holy men deserve such high honor.]]></string>
<string id="535180"><![CDATA[And what does that have to do with you? You could pass the buck to the Inquisitor and me. We would think of something to say.]]></string>
<string id="535181"><![CDATA[To whom? The crowd? Try to explain anything to them and I'll have a nice look at you becoming a martyr. From a safe distance, preferably.

<string id="535183"><![CDATA[Yes! Exactly! Why do you think Grace, this tiny little girl, manages the town cemetery? You think we don't have any undertakers? It's her position by right! By inheritance! The caretakers were poisoned by twyre and couldn't give birth to a successor!]]></string>

<string id="535197"><![CDATA[A mistake? Tell me. ]]></string>
<string id="535198"><![CDATA[I received a farewell letter from Eva informing me that she was planning to take her own life at the Cathedral.

<string id="535206"><![CDATA[Of course you're going to live.]]></string>
<string id="535207"><![CDATA[Not for myself! For all that my family's labours and vision have built.

<string id="535269"><![CDATA[And how are you going to use it?]]></string>
<string id="535277"><![CDATA[The town will be rebuilt. We will transfer it to the other side of the river. The land is clean there. Nobody will disturb us. The Polyhedron will become the foundation of a new settlement—just like the Abattoir had become one for the doomed settlement. And a new era will set in. ]]></string>
<string id="535278"><![CDATA[I'm afraid this time will never come. ]]></string>

<string id="535284"><![CDATA[If you didn't take care of me, who would breathe life into our town again? I will have so many things to do in five or ten years... Thank you, thank you!]]></string>
<string id="535285"><![CDATA[You think this town is still able to take a new lease of life?]]></string>
<string id="535286"><![CDATA[Definitely. It won't be easy, of course. But life has to be fought for, otherwise it's not real. Do not tear off the umbilical cord that has been feeding all of us since the beginning of time; these things are already going extinct almost everywhere.]]></string>
<string id="535287"><![CDATA[Is it really worth the effort to do your best for the sake of such a wretched place?]]></string>

<string id="535293"><![CDATA[Live. Do what you must.]]></string>
<string id="535294"><![CDATA[Thank you. I need to live a little longer—there's one more thing that has to be done. My death will not be purposeless now.]]></string>
<string id="535295"><![CDATA[What kind of thing?]]></string>
<string id="535296"><![CDATA[I am to perform the most precious feat of all, the feat of self-sacrifice. I will do what Simon has done—every single particle of my body and soul will become lifebearing, bursting with life and granting it to others. There will be no cannon fire. The town will continue to grow. The thread to the future will stretch from the very dawn of time.]]></string>
<string id="535297"><![CDATA[But you won't last long. You won't be enough. Consider Simon's fate!]]></string>
<string id="535298"><![CDATA[We are too few now. But if there's at least a dozen of us, it will be enough for the town to expand further and beyond. Hopefully, the place where daydreams are captured and fulfilled will live to see two hundred years more. And how many of those like me have survived?]]></string>
<string id="535299"><![CDATA[I don't care. I wanted to save your life not for the sake of future sacrifices.]]></string>
<string id="535300"><![CDATA[There'll be more of them.]]></string>
<string id="535301"><![CDATA[Do you really believe that it can be done?]]></string>

<string id="535303"><![CDATA[Live. Do what you must.]]></string>
<string id="535304"><![CDATA[Don't mention it.]]></string>
<string id="535305"><![CDATA[The outcast children who have left the Polyhedron will establish a new town. They will become new Mistresses and rulers; they will lay down a new triangle of powers and beginnings. This time, it will stand firmly on its base rather than trying to balance on one of the vertices.]]></string>
<string id="535306"><![CDATA[Why did you choose the outcasts?]]></string>
<string id="535307"><![CDATA[It's not a cause, it's an effect. They have left the Polyhedron because their fate lies elsewhere. Prisoners of dreams can build, but they cannot rule. Moreover, you have to be resolute, mature, and independent to break free from childhood. Only the most outstanding children can do it.]]></string>
<string id="535308"><![CDATA[I've heard you wanted to found a new religion?]]></string>
<string id="535309"><![CDATA[I don't. You still fail to grasp who Mistresses are. So do the children—which is why they keep talking about a religion. Can religion be invented by a man? It's not a game.]]></string>
<string id="535310"><![CDATA[Hardly. I want to leave this place.]]></string>
<string id="535311"><![CDATA[Yes. It's not a game.]]></string>
<string id="535312"><![CDATA[Tell me, will you stay with us? Will you rule the Kin like your father was supposed to?]]></string>
<string id="535313"><![CDATA[You are being insincere. I know more about pagan beliefs than you.]]></string>
<string id="535314"><![CDATA[Yes. I'll stay with you.]]></string>
<string id="535315"><![CDATA[You can leave with Aglaya, but what are you to the outer world? Am unlikable savage with backwards ideas, a futureless back countryman, an opportunist with a bloody past. When the first infatuation fades out, Aglaya will turn her back on you. You've been only brought together by the insanity of what was happening here. You should stay with us. Lead the Kin. Take care of your people. You know the lines.]]></string>
<string id="535316"><![CDATA[You are right. I know the lines.]]></string>
<string id="535317"><![CDATA[I hope you're wrong this time, little Mistress.]]></string>
<string id="535318"><![CDATA[What "triangle of powers and beginnings"?]]></string>
<string id="535319"><![CDATA[The Earth begot the town; the town begot the Tower; the tower begot the plague and cleansed the Earth. The Bachelor is wrong; to overcome nonexistence, it's not enough to just kill death. You also have to fill the void. Only the Town can overcome Chaos.]]></string>
<string id="535320"><![CDATA[Now I see.]]></string>
<string id="535321"><![CDATA[Why are you calling them outcasts? Didn't they leave Tower on their own?]]></string>
<string id="535322"><![CDATA[You are speaking like an adult man.]]></string>
<string id="535323"><![CDATA[I will rule the town—in the same fashion that my father used to when my mother was alive and glimmering. It's hard to be in control if your wife is a Mistress. I'll have to think about how to build a world for her and protect everything she will breathe life into. It won't be easy. I will start with training an army.]]></string>
<string id="535324"><![CDATA[Why are you leaving the place?]]></string>
<string id="535325"><![CDATA[Are you at least happy that you've made peace?]]></string>
<string id="535326"><![CDATA[Not entirely. But the confrontation of the two corners has turned into an enmity, and our union will put an end to that. Capella will establish a new triangle. I don't know yet what powers will become its corners. One of them will be us. Neither do I know what will come from this. Nevertheless, childhood is over. It's a shame.]]></string>
<string id="535327"><![CDATA[Big Sister is driving me away. I cannot fight her, neither can I disobey her. She is becoming the Dark Mistress, the Chariot of Night. Perhaps she already has. We'll know for sure tonight after star-rise.]]></string>
<string id="535328"><![CDATA[Why is  she driving you away?]]></string>
<string id="535329"><![CDATA[So you've agreed to side with Olgimskaya to get back at her?]]></string>
<string id="535330"><![CDATA[That's one of the reasons, yes. But spitefulness is a disgraceful feeling. In reality I am afraid of my sister. She will grow stronger than Mother, who used to be held back by Father. This is why her power had brought more good than evil. And Victoria Sr., Ursa Major, was also alive back then. Who is to hold Maria back now?]]></string>
<string id="535331"><![CDATA[Will the Kains and the Olgimskys make peace?]]></string>
<string id="535332"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="535333"><![CDATA[The Tower used to be able to bring dreams to life and preserve them. It was a Rose. Sister said it's high time the Rose becomes a Chalice. It will turn from a head into a womb, a foundation of a new world. I'll have no part of it. The children are leaving. Right now.]]></string>
<string id="535334"><![CDATA[She wants memory and the thoughts of the heroic past to inhabit the Tower instead of childhood and the dreams of future. She needs to light up a fire here. To make a furnace where she would forge a new and wonderful world.]]></string>
<string id="535335"><![CDATA[Hmm... Setting fire to this place doesn't seem like a good idea…]]></string>
<string id="535336"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="535337"><![CDATA[A stem this thin won't be a good foundation for the new world…]]></string>
<string id="535338"><![CDATA[I will bring the Tower down. That's how I'll produce precious blood from below the ground.]]></string>
<string id="535339"><![CDATA[I will.]]></string>
<string id="535340"><![CDATA[Is that enough?]]></string>
<string id="535341"><![CDATA[No. I had nothing to do with it.]]></string>
<string id="535342"><![CDATA[Indeed.]]></string>
<string id="535343"><![CDATA[I will replace the second Mistress. That means... Capella thinks I'll manage to. She says I'm shining bright—but unlike hers, my glimmer isn't thick, but rather transparent and very pale.]]></string>
<string id="535344"><![CDATA[What for?]]></string>
<string id="535345"><![CDATA[Each of us will tug the power in our own direction: she'll tug a bit upwards, and I'll tug downwards. We'll tune life together, opposing each other. Like Nina and Victoria before, but not for real. Moreover, I'll help her make the lines into a circle. At least that's my understanding.]]></string>
<string id="535346"><![CDATA[Makes sense.]]></string>
<string id="535347"><![CDATA[Will Capella be the first?]]></string>
<string id="535348"><![CDATA[Yes. I'll have to stand in contrast to her. She feels the living and I feel the dead; she knows how to take care of the living, knows what they need. I can listen to the dead and know how they turn into grass to face the sun and why each twyre blade is different... And there you go.]]></string>
<string id="535349"><![CDATA[Are these her words? You can't be making this up, can you…?]]></string>
<string id="535350"><![CDATA[These are Capella's words. She explained all this to me. But I can also feel that it's true.]]></string>
<string id="535351"><![CDATA[What else did she tell you?]]></string>
<string id="535352"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="535353"><![CDATA[I hope you'll manage.]]></string>
<string id="535354"><![CDATA[Hardly, Mother. You will manage on your own just fine.]]></string>
<string id="535355"><![CDATA[Capella did. You'll become the Foreman and the most important person in the Kin now. Everyone will follow your words like they did with Dad. And I'll always be at your side so that you know that we're all together and that the Kin loves you. That's what she promised me!]]></string>
<string id="535356"><![CDATA[Why are you so happy? You were the only one they listened to before. What do you think happens now?]]></string>
<string id="535357"><![CDATA[She couldn't have promised something like that!]]></string>
<string id="535358"><![CDATA[I'll step aside a bit, but I'll help you and connect you with everybody. I won't bother the new Mistresses even though I really want to... It's all Capella's design—even though I don't really get it.]]></string>
<string id="535359"><![CDATA[So what! She said you'll most likely agree because that's how your lines are. You're in charge of us all, we are all your responsibility. And it's the same then! You and I need to rebuild the Kin. They'll pine away without me.]]></string>
<string id="535360"><![CDATA[We'll see.]]></string>
<string id="535361"><![CDATA[So you'll also become a Mistress?]]></string>

<string id="535363"><![CDATA[It will only happen in many years. You'll change a lot by then.]]></string>
<string id="535364"><![CDATA[Yes. She also said there'll be four nodes instead of three from now on. The fourth one is me! Standing aside. A bit. Well, I mean, there always must have been four nodes, but no one noticed that before. I think things will be better now than they used to be.]]></string>
<string id="535365"><![CDATA[I hope so.]]></string>
<string id="535366"><![CDATA[I doubt that.]]></string>

<string id="535368"><![CDATA[No. There's nothing for me here anymore.]]></string>
<string id="535369"><![CDATA[A lot of things will change. I will actually stop living here. I'll have my own house.]]></string>
<string id="535370"><![CDATA[A house?]]></string>
<string id="535371"><![CDATA[The Rod. I am destined to become the Mistress of the Earth. Katerina has failed. And I won't. That's what Capella says.]]></string>

<string id="535373"><![CDATA[Capella knows that for sure. She can see the future. In ten years I'll become a tall and slender beauty. I'll have white skin and dark ankle-long hair. Or even longer. I will speak with the Earth. Perhaps even command it.]]></string>

<string id="535381"><![CDATA[I'm not sure yet. The balance is constantly shifting. The disposition of forces will be different. It won't be like the previous standoff between the Termites and the Utopians. Capella has already considered everything. It's good that she's tamed Khan. We are sick and tired of utopias. Let's build a new world, a better one!]]></string>

If I will allow him to pass the ultimate judgement, he will destroy the Polyhedron so that the town may survive at the cost of its uncommonness. Once again, the town will become the same backwater hole it was before. The hippocratic oath enjoins us to preserve the life of a genius by means of curative lobotomy. Vigorous applause.]]></string>
<string id="535684"><![CDATA[Clara will come to the Cathedral. If I will let her make the ultimate decision, she will force the Commander to withdraw his troops and the current situation will remain unchanged. Yet, might a refusal to interfere be seen as a decision in itself? In this case, the town will remain a machine of death, no matter how pretty.]]></string>
<string id="535685"><![CDATA[Fine. Let the Town remain. Let the broken circles come whole, let the interrupted processes resume. The wisdom of life is superior to that of people, so life should be allowed to proceed in its due course.  

The Utopia is doomed. Feeble men should not be tempted with miracles. There is no point to forcibly preserve something whose very idea is destroyed by any kind of coercion. The Tower, the reason and the outset of the calamity, will be demolished.]]></string>
<string id="535686"><![CDATA[Let the Tower remain; whatever the cost. Nothing like it will ever be built again. It is not a mere a building, but a symbol. It allows us a hope of a possibility that some false-truths of our ill-fated epoch might be overthrown.

It is a delicate fortress that holds veritable proof that however well-established our notions of possibility are, they still fail to account for what may or may not exist. This is the bastion I am willing to fight for.

As for the Powers That Be, they are going to regret their hypocrisy. They were so determined to force me to observe the promise I gave not to disappoint. The town they are so fond of will be reduced to rubble. This I have spoken.]]></string>
<string id="535687"><![CDATA[The Polyhedron will not survive without the Town. If the children no longer come to play inside its walls, then it will expire. Its light will snuff out if the simple-minded townsfolk no longer see it as a source of illumination; a miracle; a door to the other world.

True, the town is hardly more than a machine, pumping death from the very bowels of hell. This, however, is the only town where the Polyhedron could possibly exist. Let things remain as they are. The constant threat of pandemic is a fair price to pay for the chance of something like this Tower to appear.]]></string>

<string id="535699"><![CDATA[Yes, I was soon notified of your intercession. I'm ashamed to admit that I saw an obvious omen in it. I see omens in everything these days, old boy. And so I thought that I was burying myself prematurely; there must be something else for me to do. A calling. And it was a happy thought.]]></string>
<string id="535700"><![CDATA[And so you imbibed some more?]]></string>
<string id="535701"><![CDATA[And so I indulged in imbibing, how could I not? But this time there was a purpose. You see, I've witnessed the clear image of my future creation at the bottom of the bottle I'm so fond of. Have you seen the chalice on the opposite side of the river? The one that overcomes gravity and captures dreams?]]></string>
<string id="535702"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="535703"><![CDATA[Soon I shall erect a new chalice—a chalice to surpass the present one many times over. Twyrine sap has taught me to look at the three common dimensions from a different angle. It turns the recipient inside out, playing with density and transparency variations... Do you understand? ]]></string>
<string id="535704"><![CDATA[Not a single word you're saying.]]></string>
<string id="535705"><![CDATA[Oh, it doesn't matter at all! But when I had a complete image in my head—a calculation; a design; a blueprint; a scheme, you know?—I raised my eyes and saw the Angel of Punishment upon me. Her gaze has burned me through, her smile turning my dreams to naught.]]></string>
<string id="535706"><![CDATA[These angels always accompany the type of creativity that looks for inspiration at the bottom of a bottle.]]></string>
<string id="535707"><![CDATA[And she said, "I know who you are. You are Peter. Upon this stone you have erected that which should never be." And then she leaned over to me, her carmine lips parted, and her kiss—her kiss would have drained my dream from me forever, I know it! For it was the Angel of Doubt! A demonic temptress of hesitation...]]></string>
<string id="535708"><![CDATA[Please get to the point.]]></string>
<string id="535709"><![CDATA[But then I heard a waft of a familiar power. Maria stormed in and fought the demon! Their naked bodies intertwined… their white hands tearing at each other's throats, their slender tongues stinging one another… And then I fainted. And now—here you are...]]></string>
<string id="535710"><![CDATA[What did the demon look like? ]]></string>
<string id="535711"><![CDATA[She had a terrible and powerful presence, like Nina used to… The ceiling here is low, but still I could see a silhouette above her mortal coil, its head blending into heavens. She… hey, here she is! Look, she's still here—devouring my designs, licking them away line by line!]]></string>
<string id="535712"><![CDATA[And here we go. Delirium tremens. ]]></string>
<string id="535713"><![CDATA[But I've told you that you're safe, haven't I? The Inquisitor guarantees you protection from Saburov. ]]></string>
<string id="535714"><![CDATA[It seems to operate under a "tell, don't show" principle.]]></string>
<string id="535715"><![CDATA[Well... More or less.]]></string>
<string id="535716"><![CDATA[I see. Did you at least give her a good pinch?]]></string>
<string id="535717"><![CDATA[Does Saburov really want you dead?]]></string>
<string id="535718"><![CDATA[Why did you give the cloaks away? They offer decent protection... ]]></string>
<string id="535719"><![CDATA[I don't care anymore... It happens sooner or it happens later—what's the difference? Even if I put ten cloaks on… cloaks don't help the people that she's already set her eyes upon. I know this for a proven fact.]]></string>
<string id="535720"><![CDATA[Hey, get yourself together! You can't give up without a fight! ]]></string>
<string id="535721"><![CDATA[No. You're seeing double.]]></string>
<string id="535757"><![CDATA[What are you up to, Maria?]]></string>
<string id="535758"><![CDATA[She wants to reconcile with you. ]]></string>
<string id="535759"><![CDATA[She hates me for my mother's magical power. I know what she wants—she wants to see if I resemble my mother or not… oh, she won't leave me alive! Especially now that mother's many-coloured power has begun to awaken inside me… She'll know, she'll feel it!]]></string>
<string id="535760"><![CDATA[She says that she had frightened you somehow when you were a child. It has to pass if you give her a chance.]]></string>
<string id="535761"><![CDATA[No, I do not think so... Consider it a whim—but I'm incapable of doubting my premonitions… else too many people will suffer. It may be a superstition, I may be imagining all this, but I won't let her in! Ever!]]></string>
<string id="535762"><![CDATA[You are holding a key—as if you were about to leave. Where to?]]></string>
<string id="535763"><![CDATA[Oh no, I wasn't planning on going anywhere. And who are you to forbid me anyway...?]]></string>
<string id="535764"><![CDATA[It seems like your mother's modus operandi must have led her to having plenty of haters.]]></string>
<string id="535765"><![CDATA[What do you know about it? Have you ever seen her, at least once in your life? How can you judge... ]]></string>
<string id="535766"><![CDATA[Come now, I didn't want to offend you... Are those tears in your eyes?]]></string>
<string id="535767"><![CDATA[Come now, it was merely a hallucination. ]]></string>
<string id="535770"><![CDATA[What if you manage to influence her so much that the Inquisitor starts acting in our favour?]]></string>
<string id="535771"><![CDATA[Well, as you wish. I won't interfere with your family business.]]></string>

<string id="535773"><![CDATA[Oh no! Please don't tell Dad. He must not be disturbed now… don't go there! He must not get distracted… today is memory day.]]></string>

<string id="535775"><![CDATA[You've piqued my curiosity. ]]></string>
<string id="535776"><![CDATA[She doesn't have to. One look at these chambers, and she realized everything. Oh, what have you done! Now she knows all about Peter. Good thing he's unconscious… but it won't last long. We need to call for help.]]></string>
<string id="535777"><![CDATA[I already regret my choice. Forgive me. ]]></string>
<string id="535778"><![CDATA[A rare confession for a girl.]]></string>
<string id="535779"><![CDATA[If you want to make up for it—take her away from there. Now! I can't do it myself… I wanted to call someone for help so that they would distract her with troubling news or something…]]></string>
<string id="535780"><![CDATA[Okay, I'll do it. Just don't cry. Oh my God... ]]></string>
<string id="535781"><![CDATA[I wanted to reconcile you two.]]></string>
<string id="535782"><![CDATA[Why did you leave them? ]]></string>
<string id="535783"><![CDATA[She is much stronger than me... She defeated me. I'm not a Mistress yet after all, and  I'm weaker than ever now that I'm expecting… I'm gaping open, turned inside out… It only takes a single touch to cause me pain…]]></string>
<string id="535784"><![CDATA[What can I do for you? ]]></string>
<string id="535785"><![CDATA[Come now, calm down... I'm sorry.]]></string>
<string id="535786"><![CDATA[I'll call for you when I need you.]]></string>
<string id="535787"><![CDATA[My name is Ayan. I am a dancer, the daughter of Hook the herdsman from the Boissa kin. I'm even related to the Oyuns menkhu kin through my father's sister. Andrey sent me here to look after the house and serve you.]]></string>
<string id="535788"><![CDATA[All right. Stay. A swift and sharp maid would be useful to me.]]></string>
<string id="535789"><![CDATA[How nice of him…]]></string>
<string id="535790"><![CDATA[I want to get some sleep.]]></string>
<string id="535791"><![CDATA[Your master? Who's that?]]></string>
<string id="535798"><![CDATA[Where is Eva?]]></string>
<string id="535799"><![CDATA[Are you alone? Is your woman not here?]]></string>
<string id="535800"><![CDATA[Evidently.]]></string>
<string id="535801"><![CDATA[Hurry up and go to Andrey then. He needs your help to make her come back, to take her away from the Worms. She went to them of her own accord, but he said that was because she'd gone mad.]]></string>
<string id="535802"><![CDATA[So he knows where Eva is? I need to know what he wanted you to tell me—and I need to know the exact words!]]></string>
<string id="535803"><![CDATA[Don't be angry with me, oynon… Andrey told me to make a dash for the oynon's place as quickly as I could to check if his woman was there. If I found her, I was to tell her that he was coming and make sure she doesn't harm herself. If I do not find her but find the oynon, he told me to fetch you. He said you two would have to face trouble.]]></string>
<string id="535804"><![CDATA[I don't understand a thing!]]></string>
<string id="535805"><![CDATA[Neither do I. But Andrey does. Help him, so that he doesn't get himself killed… He is unarmed. He gave his weapon to the Changeling. Then he told me to run here, run as fast as I could. And so I did, like a leaf on the wind, like the wind itself—that's how fast I was!]]></string>
<string id="535806"><![CDATA[The Worms? What do the Worms have to do with it?]]></string>
<string id="535807"><![CDATA[Haruspex Burakh opened their bride up. Now the earth refuses to grant them herbs. They demanded a woman that has the gift of warmth. If she doesn't lure in herbs for them either, they'll feed her to the earth to stop this plague.]]></string>
<string id="535808"><![CDATA[And what does that have to do with Eva?]]></string>
<string id="535809"><![CDATA[Haruspex Burakh may have told her about it. He was looking for a woman that has the gift of warmth, one he wouldn't mind giving away. But I've never seen your woman, so I can't say anything for certain.]]></string>
<string id="535810"><![CDATA[Why do you insist on spewing nonsense then if you have no idea what you're even talking about? And what does Eva have to do with the Worms?!]]></string>
<string id="535811"><![CDATA[You are not getting away with this one… my dear colleague.]]></string>
<string id="535812"><![CDATA[All right. Seems like I should rather talk to Andrey than you.]]></string>
<string id="535813"><![CDATA[Why would he wait for a chicken?]]></string>
<string id="535814"><![CDATA[Listen here, your insults are absolutely baseless! I was the person to equip Andrey in the first place. It's not my fault he gave his weapon away to that psychic girl. Here, take this—and give it to him. We've all pitched in…]]></string>
<string id="535815"><![CDATA[What marsh?]]></string>
<string id="535816"><![CDATA[The marsh where the gatherer lives, the one who wanted to take revenge on Andrey for buying infusion secrets. Then there are butchers, who were finally released from the Termitary today, and they were all too eager to get even with Andrey, having found out that there had been a murderous feud among the gatherers because of him. They also went to that gatherer.]]></string>
<string id="535817"><![CDATA[I see. I know where to look now.]]></string>
<string id="535818"><![CDATA[I beg your pardon!]]></string>
<string id="535819"><![CDATA[What, am I wrong?]]></string>
<string id="535820"><![CDATA[Pardon denied.]]></string>
<string id="535821"><![CDATA[Neither do I. I'm terrified of them.]]></string>
<string id="535822"><![CDATA[And what is that thing you're holding behind your back embarrassedly, huh?]]></string>
<string id="535823"><![CDATA[I'll do just fine without it. Get away from me. I don't like you.]]></string>
<string id="535824"><![CDATA[Perhaps.]]></string>
<string id="535825"><![CDATA[She is magnanimous. That is her main virtue. Blessed naturally with an abundant spiritual wealth, she gives it away with the generosity that would befit royalty.]]></string>
<string id="535826"><![CDATA[Can't say I agree.]]></string>
<string id="535827"><![CDATA[How can you tell if you haven't spoken with her for quite a while?]]></string>
<string id="535828"><![CDATA[Madness is frightening... It's the only thing I'm truly afraid of. ]]></string>
<string id="535831"><![CDATA[And then what? ]]></string>
<string id="535832"><![CDATA[I barely had time to comprehend what had happened—and then the dancer, Ayan, appeared. She said that the Worms were sending their regards—they were thankful that I had fed my woman to them. "We're even now," they said. You know me; without further dilly-dallying, I put two and two together, and came to the conclusion that they were referring to Eva.]]></string>
<string id="535833"><![CDATA[Well, I just assumed it could have been Eva—and went straight to the Worms. And I sent the girl to you in case Eva had indeed decided to end her life at the Cathedral. But Ayan messed everything up. So here we are... ]]></string>
<string id="535834"><![CDATA[Whoa… an unexpected turn of events. How do you know this?]]></string>
<string id="535835"><![CDATA[Here we are where?]]></string>
<string id="535838"><![CDATA[It makes sense. She wrote to me that the only thing she was always ready to give her life for is the cause my brother and I have pledged ourselves to. So she wanted to imbue the building with her soul. That was her personal interpretation of our cause—an interpretation both deranged and... lovely. She knew how to get straight to the heart...]]></string>
<string id="535840"><![CDATA[Don't you think it's your pride talking?]]></string>
<string id="535841"><![CDATA[I'm gutted and turned inside out. I'm neither pious not exceptionally moral, you know, but that's simply too much. I need to find a way to keep living and working so that Eva's death wouldn't have been in vain.]]></string>
<string id="535842"><![CDATA[What focus? You mean the Focus that the Kains mentioned?]]></string>
<string id="535843"><![CDATA[Now it is not the best moment to discuss that. Whether Eva was out of her mind or not... I do not know. And what has she written to you? ]]></string>
<string id="535844"><![CDATA[She said she was going to purify the place for the new guest. That means the place is the Cathedral and the guest is Aglaya, right? ]]></string>
<string id="535845"><![CDATA[Why are you confident that she has gone mad? ]]></string>
<string id="535846"><![CDATA[But her interpretation was too literal. Someone must have put it into her head… And I think I know who!]]></string>
<string id="535847"><![CDATA[And who might these petitioners be?]]></string>
<string id="535848"><![CDATA[Petitioners indeed! Well, see, we've heard all about your efforts… so, well… we've decided to set up embassy here. We've been told all about your plan to sterilize us all.]]></string>
<string id="535849"><![CDATA[What?! Who told you this drivel?]]></string>
<string id="535850"><![CDATA[Uncle Bachelor, we don't need vaccine. The order was the Inquisitor's, but you'll be held responsible. Don't! It'll be a simple waste of precious medicine, better give it to our families. We're all healthy up there—and healthy will we remain. Hand on heart.]]></string>
<string id="535851"><![CDATA[I'd rather preferred Eva Yan in her stead…]]></string>
<string id="535852"><![CDATA[Yes, I was going to touch on that.]]></string>
<string id="535853"><![CDATA[With your kind permission, let us put that conversation off until tomorrow. Before we start the search, I need to get the fullest picture of what's happened here. So right now the priority is to interrogate the Bound and collect the watchers' reports.]]></string>
<string id="535854"><![CDATA[So, where's the source?]]></string>
<string id="535855"><![CDATA[So: there is a faulty detail in this mechanism of ours. We only need to find it. Where do we start?]]></string>
<string id="535856"><![CDATA[Easy for you to say.]]></string>
<string id="535857"><![CDATA[You seem to know something already…]]></string>
<string id="535858"><![CDATA[Conjecture, pure conjecture... and nothing but conjecture. The Olgimskys' closet can barely hold a gigantic skeleton, and I can't really say I even care as to who had put it there. But here's what I'm thinking: what if this skeleton's made such a ruckus falling out to cover for another one? Although... don't lose sleep over this one yet.]]></string>
<string id="535859"><![CDATA[Go ahead.]]></string>
<string id="535860"><![CDATA[Thanatica has already been destroyed. There's nothing left; the place itself is in ruins, your research is in ashes. Your papers have been burnt. Wretched Telman made sure of it personally. And now I am going to tell you about the law.]]></string>
<string id="535861"><![CDATA[…Why not. Go ahead.]]></string>
<string id="535862"><![CDATA[In accordance with the Law, the very logic of our world inevitably dictates the destruction of anything unnatural: anything that tries to break its own, non-capitalized laws. The disease is nothing more than a tool. It is an instrument of inevitability.]]></string>
<string id="535863"><![CDATA[I agree. The idea isn't new. It occurred to me before.]]></string>
<string id="535864"><![CDATA[Inevitability. Gruesome inevitability is our true enemy. An enemy that cannot be defeated. By anyone. Anywhere. The only thing you can do is get what's dear to you out of its way. Don't make enemies with inevitability!]]></string>
<string id="535865"><![CDATA[And so we're back to the source now. Sources… it's always about sources, isn't it? We just can't get away from them, we… sourcerers, if you pardon the lame pun. But sourcerers do not wield magic.]]></string>
<string id="535866"><![CDATA[The source? I'll tell you where to look for the source. So you think you're well aware of what the Law is, aren't you?]]></string>
<string id="535867"><![CDATA[…Are you telling the truth?]]></string>
<string id="535868"><![CDATA[Yes. I know how much you appreciate the truth; so do I, trust me. Looking for the truth is my job. I consider you to be my equal, and so there is no reason for me to lie to you. That would be a disservice to myself… and to the job itself, of course. Would you be interested to know more about the Law? The path of logic, so to speak?]]></string>
<string id="535869"><![CDATA[Yes. Go ahead.]]></string>
<string id="535870"><![CDATA[No. I don't care. I apologize; I want to be alone for a while now.]]></string>
<string id="535871"><![CDATA[And yet I have sworn to destroy this enemy.]]></string>
<string id="535872"><![CDATA[Darting away from harm's way? This is now my modus operandi.]]></string>
<string id="535873"><![CDATA[You're doomed then. ]]></string>
<string id="535874"><![CDATA[I'm doomed then.]]></string>
<string id="535875"><![CDATA[Well… You're a profound thinker, no denying that. We'll see as to how effective this philosophy turns out to be in practice.]]></string>
<string id="535876"><![CDATA[This preaching would have made more sense before the plague… Say what you will, but fighting this enemy is my duty. As it is yours.]]></string>
<string id="535877"><![CDATA[You're right. The second part of the game is beginning. Our current task is to remain true to ourselves. We'll keep the word we've given to the Powers That Be—both of us; it wasn't just you, mind. We'll uncover the truth, take a foreign detail out of the mechanism, and stop the rot before it devours this land. We only have to find out how it started.]]></string>
<string id="535880"><![CDATA[So it's pointless to look for the source, isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="535881"><![CDATA[I can see where you're going with this.]]></string>
<string id="535882"><![CDATA[Aren't you a nimble lad? Behave yourself!]]></string>
<string id="535883"><![CDATA[Sterilize, huh?]]></string>
<string id="535884"><![CDATA[Umm… Wrong wording, I guess? I meant curing us… eh… making us healthy, that is, distributing protective pills, wiping us with spirits, gargle with mouthwash if you please, bathe your feet like a good kid you are? To avoid the infection and stuff.]]></string>
<string id="535885"><![CDATA[Ah, I see… Yes, I did indeed have such a plan.]]></string>
<string id="535886"><![CDATA[The thought never even crossed my mind.]]></string>
<string id="535887"><![CDATA[What is that supposed to mean, young man?]]></string>
<string id="535888"><![CDATA[Our Tower is magical. It protects us from the outer world. Everybody knows that, duh! And we're, like… See, if you care about us so much, better bring us some dry blue fire that doesn't burn paper! You've come from another place, after all… Do they have that kind of fire there?]]></string>
<string id="535889"><![CDATA[Dang it, I think I've misplaced my piece. Sorry.]]></string>
<string id="535890"><![CDATA[I'll cure myself.]]></string>
<string id="535891"><![CDATA[Mechanics, huh…? Like you know what the word even means! I need proof!]]></string>
<string id="535892"><![CDATA[Oh, just ask anyone. Even Capella! Yeah, go pay her a visit! She doesn't believe in the Tower's miracles at all, but she'll provide you with proof all right. She wouldn't lie after all. Which means her testimony is the most reliable one… I guess.]]></string>
<string id="535893"><![CDATA[No no no, we don't need any of this. I'm telling you, the Tower is specular, it's maed of mirrors—that reflect the disease back out.]]></string>
<string id="535894"><![CDATA[I don't believe you. And I don't see any miracles there anyway.]]></string>
<string id="535895"><![CDATA[Indeed, she seemed like a very reasonable young lady to me.]]></string>
<string id="535896"><![CDATA[Too bad. We were so sure you'd give us magical fire. Real fire can damage our Tower, you see.]]></string>
<string id="535897"><![CDATA[Who can vouch that there are indeed no infected children in the Tower? I swallowed that bait once already.]]></string>
<string id="535898"><![CDATA[No, I like it here. The place grew on me.]]></string>
<string id="535899"><![CDATA[And who says that?]]></string>
<string id="535900"><![CDATA[Its inhabitants.]]></string>
<string id="535901"><![CDATA[That's not how it is. You cannot ignore the obvious. The Tower does manage to perform truly breathtaking feats. And yes, by the way, I am sure that the disease—being of particular interest to you—or any other evil from outside cannot get into the tower whatsoever. It is evil enough on its own.]]></string>
<string id="535902"><![CDATA[What feats, for example?]]></string>
<string id="535903"><![CDATA[It seems to somehow affect the internal state of a person. And so the wonderful but fleeting things, such as dreams, love, the accidental concurrence of fantasies, obsession with desires, or mystical games—all of those thing last... forever inside—against their evanescent nature.]]></string>
<string id="535904"><![CDATA[How in the world is it blasphemous?]]></string>
<string id="535905"><![CDATA[Just, you know... people.]]></string>
<string id="535906"><![CDATA[Yes, the Tower preserves childhood together with all its magic. But you cannot grasp a miracle and hold to it mechanically! You cannot treat the miraculous like that! A miracle can only reveal itself through a living person—like my mother... and be born of magical power, not of rationale!]]></string>
<string id="535907"><![CDATA[So does the Tower do it rationally?]]></string>
<string id="535908"><![CDATA[I'd like to know more about its inherent evil, young lady.]]></string>
<string id="535909"><![CDATA[I admit that the Tower can perform miracles—but I do not believe it's miraculous by nature. It's dead, you see. It does not live. That is why it can do what it does—a living person would see just how blasphemous it is!]]></string>
<string id="535910"><![CDATA[Incredible... Are you laughing at me?]]></string>
<string id="535911"><![CDATA[Not in the slightest. That's exactly why the children are so fond of it. All their wonderful games, the magical places, the journeys towards outer worlds—all the wonders of  сhildhood are consentrated in the Tower. And they never go.]]></string>
<string id="535912"><![CDATA[You are laughing at me!]]></string>
<string id="535913"><![CDATA[It also allows you to come back... say, to a particular dream. Or a forgotten game. But most importantly—it allows you to do so in someone else's company! You can bring a person—or even persons, I believe—into your dream. They can see your revery through your own eyes. They can fall in love with what you love.]]></string>
<string id="535914"><![CDATA[So what does it do?]]></string>
<string id="535915"><![CDATA[If there's even a shred of truth to what you're saying, then it is indeed astonishing…]]></string>
<string id="535916"><![CDATA[I was mislead. I've been told you were sceptical towards this structure, resentful even. And what do I see?]]></string>
<string id="535917"><![CDATA[The Kains have set up a seditious experiment. The Stamatins brag that they had overcome the laws of gravity and Euclidean geometry, whilst in reality it was the Kains who took it upon themselves to attack the laws of sorcery and the miraculous powers that stumble upon our world from time to time! While the Stamatins were building ladders, the Kains were creating Foci...]]></string>
<string id="535918"><![CDATA[And what's wrong with that? Isn't it wonderful?]]></string>
<string id="535919"><![CDATA[If everybody settled for this line of thinking, humankind would have never conquered the skies or explored the nature of flame.]]></string>

<string id="535921"><![CDATA[If you happen to come by, please give her this medicine and tell her that I—me personally, it's important!—that I told her to take it if she ever feels unwell. She will trust me. Otherwise they'll keep taking those horrible yellow pills—the only ones they acknowledge...]]></string>

<string id="535924"><![CDATA[Please come by later to tell me how it went! It means the world to me.]]></string>
<string id="535925"><![CDATA[Sure. And this Tower story of yours was… most engaging. I'm very happy I've decided to drop by.]]></string>
<string id="535926"><![CDATA[She is five—and keeps five thousand people under here rule. Well, it's less than five now, I guess... Still, how is that possible?]]></string>
<string id="535927"><![CDATA[He is a holy child. The Kin will live and thrive as long she is healthy and happy.]]></string>
<string id="535928"><![CDATA[Yes, while in the Termitary, I've noticed the apparent signs of intense vitality and overall thriving…]]></string>
<string id="535929"><![CDATA[And yet she follows your word?]]></string>
<string id="535930"><![CDATA[Don't you dare!]]></string>
<string id="535931"><![CDATA[Can I talk to him?]]></string>
<string id="535932"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="535933"><![CDATA[Tell the butchers to let me in, please.]]></string>
<string id="535934"><![CDATA[Can I talk to him?]]></string>
<string id="535935"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="535936"><![CDATA[Tell the butchers to let me in, please.]]></string>
<string id="535937"><![CDATA[It is real, just unusual.]]></string>
<string id="535938"><![CDATA[Well, Capella told me you should take them. If you ever get sick. All right?]]></string>
<string id="535939"><![CDATA[Well… all right. But only because Capella says so. I would swallow a bumblebee for her!]]></string>
<string id="535941"><![CDATA[No. I don't believe you. These thingies look very very suspicious. I think they're counterfeit.]]></string>
<string id="535942"><![CDATA[Look at you, using such big words!]]></string>
<string id="535943"><![CDATA[…They're not counterfeit. These are antibiotics.]]></string>
<string id="535944"><![CDATA[It's fine. A revolver is a rather capable translator.]]></string>
<string id="535957"><![CDATA[...What, antibodies?]]></string>
<string id="535958"><![CDATA[Yes. Antibodies. You already know what living bacteria look like, as well as dead ones. Stakh told me all about that. I think it won't be too hard for you to establish what this blood does to the infection.]]></string>
<string id="535959"><![CDATA[Whose blood is this, Burakh?]]></string>
<string id="535960"><![CDATA[I can't tell you.]]></string>
<string id="535961"><![CDATA[No, keep it. I've already produced a vaccine. The town is locked down tight. I have no need of a panacea.]]></string>
<string id="535962"><![CDATA[I am not going to have any business with a person who doesn't trust me.]]></string>
<string id="535963"><![CDATA[All right, I'll have a look. Where do I find you?]]></string>
<string id="535964"><![CDATA[The result, oynon? You know I can't tell you. I'm bound by a word given, and I thought that was something you respected.]]></string>
<string id="535965"><![CDATA[Well, in short, yes, it does produce two types of antibodies—one stops the horned bacteria from propagating, another one kills them. We've got a unicum here.]]></string>
<string id="535966"><![CDATA[Why is it alive? As if just extracted from the body. But surely a lot of time must have passed…]]></string>
<string id="535967"><![CDATA[You wouldn't understand, oynon. It is a kind of knowledge that's incompatible with yours. I have no idea myself yet. Too much learning in my head after these universities of yours… only adds to the confusion. Any antibodies in there?]]></string>
<string id="535968"><![CDATA[There are. Rather unique antibodies at that.]]></string>
<string id="535969"><![CDATA[No. Nothing in there.]]></string>
<string id="535970"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="535971"><![CDATA[Inconcievable! A child ending up it such a position!]]></string>
<string id="535972"><![CDATA[I'm far more interested in how she manages to cope with all these horrors.]]></string>
<string id="535973"><![CDATA[They don't let here out of her room though… do they?]]></string>
<string id="535974"><![CDATA[They do. I've met her in the other building. Thing is, she's not vile or heartless. She's simply from another era. Death does not frighten her.]]></string>
<string id="535975"><![CDATA[Why wouldn't she let me in?]]></string>
<string id="535976"><![CDATA[Thank you. I think I have a plan now.]]></string>
<string id="535977"><![CDATA[Brewers of fake panacea are holed up somewhere here in the Termitary. Do you know anything about that?]]></string>
<string id="535978"><![CDATA[What? Someone's making fake panacea, in here? But this is…]]></string>
<string id="535979"><![CDATA[Just an unproven rumour.]]></string>
<string id="535980"><![CDATA[...Yes, an inconceivable villainy. Have you maybe noticed anything suspicious?]]></string>
<string id="535981"><![CDATA[Hold on a second... Some odonghe on the second floor asked for corpses of the freshly dead. They seemed to be looking for someone they knew. I took no notice back then. Apart from that, newcomer tramps went around looking for some room along that wall across the entrance. Dangled money... ]]></string>
<string id="535982"><![CDATA[Which room? On the second floor as well?]]></string>
<string id="535983"><![CDATA[Damned if I know... I had a short way with them.]]></string>
<string id="535984"><![CDATA[Oh, right. Is that them under the sheet?]]></string>
<string id="535985"><![CDATA[Thank you, Burakh.]]></string>
<string id="535986"><![CDATA[So, tell me, Mother, does anyone around here produce medicine?]]></string>
<string id="535987"><![CDATA[How can you make medicine if you're not a doctor? It's forbidden. And it won't work…]]></string>
<string id="535988"><![CDATA[Right. Those people are criminals. They deserve to be punished.]]></string>
<string id="535989"><![CDATA[Go ahead and punish them then. I'd punish such people too If I saw them. Unless they know the lines, that is.]]></string>
<string id="535990"><![CDATA[Are you saying your servants wouldn't touch me if I attacked those bad people?]]></string>
<string id="535991"><![CDATA[You might be right.]]></string>
<string id="535992"><![CDATA[Huh, you just gave me an excellent idea… But you seem to be scared?]]></string>
<string id="535993"><![CDATA[The "crud"?]]></string>
<string id="535994"><![CDATA[I'll have you know that a certain informer of mine… a trustworthy source despite being a Worm… has told me that there's a flow of fake panacea coming out of the Termitary. I'll be honest with you; this is encroaching upon my interests. So I'm turning to you for help. This concerns you as well, after all.]]></string>
<string id="535995"><![CDATA[And what are your interests?]]></string>
<string id="535996"><![CDATA[Truth is, the slimeballs are backing themselves up with… yes, your own good name. They claim that the recipe is yours and even provide some, erm, proof of authorship. I don't know what exactly that is, but, really, your name is actually proof enough for the general crowd... they're rather naïve. And the heart incident has already become common knowledge... in certain circles at least.]]></string>
<string id="535997"><![CDATA[What does that have to do with anything? The heart was required to extract a microbial culture sample!]]></string>
<string id="535998"><![CDATA[Well, in any case… They're procuring live hearts, of which there's no shortage in the Termitary now… and preparing the potions right in front of their buyers. You can imagine the resulting product.]]></string>
<string id="535999"><![CDATA[I've heard you loud and clear. So you're saying they've set up shop in the Termitary, right?]]></string>
<string id="536000"><![CDATA[My informer said that it's one of the rooms in the Long Block. He hasn't seen it himself. ]]></string>
<string id="536001"><![CDATA[What does it have to do with my visit to the Termitary?]]></string>
<string id="536002"><![CDATA[This concerns me? How?]]></string>
<string id="536003"><![CDATA[It's all very simple. Panacea will always be in short supply, that much is obvious. My dear friend Burakh, the highest authority on this, claims that he'll be able to produce fifteen batches at best. I'm interested in seeing them find their way… into the right hands.]]></string>
<string id="536004"><![CDATA[But who would buy unverified panacea?]]></string>
<string id="536005"><![CDATA[What is that supposed to mean?]]></string>
<string id="536006"><![CDATA[As soon as the Bound find out about the panacea, or worse yet, get their hands on a flask of that ersatz drug… You've seen them—they're romantics just waiting for an opportunity to pull off a heroic sacrifice. Obtaining fake panacea would cause them to lose all prudence. They'll take risks, rush headlong into infection hotspots thinking they have salvation in their pocket... and then the salvation won't work.]]></string>
<string id="536007"><![CDATA[Are you sure that a real panacea even exists?]]></string>
<string id="536008"><![CDATA[Oh, yes, it does—since yesterday. I've checked. The Inquisitor is aware, by the way, although it's being kept secret for now… for obvious reasons.]]></string>
<string id="536009"><![CDATA[All right. And what do you know about those remedy-makers?]]></string>
<string id="536010"><![CDATA[The heart incident was Burakh's handiwork. I had nothing to do with it.]]></string>
<string id="536011"><![CDATA[I never expected you to care so much about other people… Yes, you are of course correct. The consequences could be abysmal.]]></string>
<string id="536012"><![CDATA[Yes, like I said, the matter is urgent. Not only must we weed out those criminals, we must also put a stop to the rumours… as well as the crudflow. And it would be better for you to accomplish all of that personally… Burakh might be better suited for the job… but it's not about skill or connections; I just feel like we should avoid unnecessary gossip...]]></string>
<string id="536013"><![CDATA[I don't understand. What are you implying?]]></string>
<string id="536014"><![CDATA[I shudder to imagine the sheer number of rooms there… I have my work cut out for me.]]></string>
<string id="536015"><![CDATA[Yes, when I learned that Burakh had concocted a panacea, I decided to completely seize the flow of goods. That's how the informers came to know… I requested it on purpose. Make no mistake, this isn't about greed… I simply thought it would be prudent to control this market. One would emerge anyway...]]></string>
<string id="536016"><![CDATA[So your concern for the Bound was only a disguise? Your were only ever concerned with turning a profit…]]></string>
<string id="536017"><![CDATA[It seems my old reputation will take a while to get rid of… Your knowledge is outdated, Bachelor. Things have changed. I have changed. This morning I wanted to seize the panacea black market… so I bought up everything that Burakh has made and distributed...]]></string>
<string id="536018"><![CDATA[And?]]></string>
<string id="536019"><![CDATA[I gave away all that I had bought. No money… well, a little money, so that it wouldn't look like I'm offering a donation. I gave it all to the Bound. The ones who needed it the most… in my opinion. Those who nearly died because of me.]]></string>
<string id="536020"><![CDATA[Who?]]></string>
<string id="536021"><![CDATA[Oh, and to think I almost believed you… I even regretted thinking you a cynical man!]]></string>
<string id="536022"><![CDATA[…But you have spared at least one for yourself, I hope? Haven't you?]]></string>
<string id="536023"><![CDATA[I need neither money nor protection from death now. The latter because I want to give the plague the opportunity to punish me for my acts. And the former… please spare me your mockery… is because I now aspire to something. Call me sentimental. I won't reveal it; I don't want to scare the dream away.]]></string>
<string id="536024"><![CDATA[Hm. "A little" by your standards?]]></string>
<string id="536025"><![CDATA[Not really… by common ones, I would think. By peacetime standards, even… Five hundred coins for a flask seems to be perfectly reasonable—especially considering antibiotics cost two or three thousand now.]]></string>
<string id="536026"><![CDATA[I regret my sarcasm, master Vlad. I beg your forgiveness.]]></string>
<string id="536027"><![CDATA[I wonder if your buyers will corroborate your story.]]></string>
<string id="536028"><![CDATA[You are a noble man, master Vlad. Allow me to shake your hand!]]></string>
<string id="536029"><![CDATA[You're more than welcome... We're not asking much, merely thirty thousand. But for you, oynon, it's free! Dead gruel, never better. All the rot comes out, all the evil hexes come off, oh yes, my good man...]]></string>
<string id="536030"><![CDATA[Merely thirty thousand, huh? Are you sure you're not underselling, mate?]]></string>
<string id="536031"><![CDATA[Ay, oynon, have mercy, let us be! We won't sell anything anymore, won't cook the gruel... You let us live, you don't turn us in to the Mother—we tell you an interesting something then. You'll be pleased…]]></string>
<string id="536032"><![CDATA[Speak. I'm not going to touch you, word.]]></string>
<string id="536033"><![CDATA[I haven't yet decided what to do with you.]]></string>
<string id="536034"><![CDATA[So you're using my method, is that it? Peddling your filth under my name, you scum!]]></string>
<string id="536035"><![CDATA[Speak then. If I like what I hear, I won't give you away.]]></string>
<string id="536036"><![CDATA[...Vlad the Younger, you mean?]]></string>
<string id="536037"><![CDATA[Yes, oynon, yes... Him. The bloodsucker. Have mercy on us, oynon, don't shoot us slack-baked folk…]]></string>
<string id="536038"><![CDATA[How do you know about this?]]></string>
<string id="536039"><![CDATA[Lots of people come through here, oynon… This we know from someone holy, someone worth trusting.]]></string>
<string id="536040"><![CDATA[...Do you know what the real panacea is made of?]]></string>
<string id="536041"><![CDATA[Right... figures. So she's into panacea now too?]]></string>
<string id="536042"><![CDATA[Yes, the whole ordeal is surreal. But you seem to be unfazed by it.]]></string>
<string id="536043"><![CDATA[Incredible. I'm starting to suspect he's in league with you.]]></string>
<string id="536044"><![CDATA[It's the Tower. The only thing that leads the plots of my performances astray is the Tower. The Tower—and everything that has to do with it… those are the only things that cannot be tossed and turned and manipulated like puppets. A miracle overcomes the inevitable. The Tower can do miracles. It all makes sense.]]></string>
<string id="536045"><![CDATA[I'm not sure it does.]]></string>
<string id="536046"><![CDATA[You will still have an opportunity to ponder it. The Tower is an ambiguous phenomenon. There's no need to rush to conclusions. I have, as you can see, fallen in love with it… I think of it as my safe haven. But you should keep a cool head.]]></string>
<string id="536047"><![CDATA[I don't know if I want to… That's how many stunning discoveries I've made today.]]></string>
<string id="536048"><![CDATA[Oh fine… He gave it to the girls—to Yulia, Lara, and the third one that begs to keep her name secret under any circumstances. Think of them as the three parcae…]]></string>
<string id="536049"><![CDATA[He isn't. First of all, I also believe in lofty ideals—don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The salvation is not about the panacea. The panacea is transitory. But recently I came to realize something that has blown me out of the water completely and made me reevaluate my worldview. So... I believe in Vlad's transformation.]]></string>
<string id="536050"><![CDATA[What did you realize?]]></string>
<string id="536051"><![CDATA[That fate can be overcome. I'm so tired of all this… You know, many people consider my shows to be mere tricks—but I know that's untrue. They are daily reminders of Predetermination reigning over us… it's depressing. But now I see that a miracle is not completely impossible.]]></string>
<string id="536052"><![CDATA[Please, go on! What makes it possible?]]></string>
<string id="536053"><![CDATA[Did Vlad really let someone else have his panacea? I didn't believe him… ]]></string>
<string id="536054"><![CDATA[Hmm. Yes, he's given his panacea to the girls that have once almost died through his fault… at least he thinks so now… actually, it's very typical of a person of his temper… in a situation like this. He's giving his possessions away with a firm and steady hand. Paying the old debts.]]></string>
<string id="536055"><![CDATA[Who are these girls? ]]></string>
<string id="536056"><![CDATA[I see. Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="536057"><![CDATA[…Sure. So what have you done with your vial of panacea?]]></string>
<string id="536058"><![CDATA[I have an idea about what to do with it. I won't share it with you, sorry. I fear this… Changeling. She is a remarkable foe and a worthy opponent… when in comes to miracle-making. A rather nimble girl. She's gathering intelligence now, you see, and her intentions are dark. Her intuition is spot on, so I'd rather she knew less.]]></string>
<string id="536059"><![CDATA[Don't you trust me?]]></string>
<string id="536060"><![CDATA[Don't worry, I will. You know that I am a man of principle.]]></string>
<string id="536061"><![CDATA[Oh, undoubtely.]]></string>
<string id="536062"><![CDATA[In that case tell me at least who else Vlad the Younger shared panacea with.]]></string>
<string id="536063"><![CDATA[Her intentions are dark?]]></string>
<string id="536064"><![CDATA[She is a fanatic. And, like any fanatic, she is obsessed. I think she has a very… unique idea of what to do with the precious vials. She may even try to destroy them.]]></string>
<string id="536065"><![CDATA[But what for? ]]></string>
<string id="536066"><![CDATA[Can there be another source of miracles—apart from her, that is? That would be blaspemy and sacrilege to her. People should only hope for the power emanating from her, otherwise the power will dry out… without the faith, that is. And if it does, the designs of the poor thing will fall through. And she has grand designs, believe me.]]></string>
<string id="536067"><![CDATA[Mine are definitely grander. Or at least more reliable.]]></string>
<string id="536068"><![CDATA[Oh yes... She's an incredibly mysterious person. Rest assured that her incognito will not be uncovered.]]></string>
<string id="536069"><![CDATA[I see. Why, thank you for the engaging conversation. ]]></string>
<string id="536070"><![CDATA[What a relief.]]></string>
<string id="536071"><![CDATA[Well… To tell the truth, it is a bit annoying. You know, recently I've been driven to change my views on what "fate" is a little too often.]]></string>
<string id="536072"><![CDATA[Could be… Wait a minute… something awful has just occurred to me, thanks to you.]]></string>
<string id="536073"><![CDATA[Don't worry about it. Not that I ever took it seriously... a pretty vial and hardly anything more than that.]]></string>
<string id="536074"><![CDATA[What did Younger Vlad have to say about it? ]]></string>
<string id="536075"><![CDATA[Thank you.  Don't hurry to drink it, Yulia. Its origin is unclear. ]]></string>
<string id="536076"><![CDATA[You know what? Come back tomorrow. We will be able to hold a much more productive discussion then, which may be of some use to us both. Meanwhile, I need to think. You see, everything that went on is rather curious in the light of certain theories I entertain. Numbers, equations, calculations of possibility... everything you don't seem to be too fond of yourself.]]></string>
<string id="536077"><![CDATA[Give it to me, Yulia.]]></string>
<string id="536078"><![CDATA[Not that I mind... But, I am sorry to say I was advised not to. I gave my word that I would not co-operate with you. Don't be so disappointed. I am not enjoying this whole rigmarole myself. I am clueless as to what it is intended for. The mind boggles...]]></string>
<string id="536079"><![CDATA[Who did you give your word to? Was it Vlad the Younger or Clara?]]></string>
<string id="536080"><![CDATA[Very well. I'll be back tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="536081"><![CDATA[I rely on your common sense, Yulia.]]></string>
<string id="536082"><![CDATA[If Aglaya Lilich tells the truth… than we may be in luck.]]></string>
<string id="536083"><![CDATA[Lara, I know everything. Just tell me how it went. How much did he make you shell out?]]></string>
<string id="536084"><![CDATA[…Nothing. It wasn't an item to sell, it was a gift. Have you seen the man recently? He's positively transformed! Something's happened to him, I'm good at spotting these things. But has it occurred to you that I may have parted with my panacea already? Yulia, for example, gave hers to Clara—at least that's what Clara says. So why do you think I haven't done the same?]]></string>
<string id="536085"><![CDATA[Please be careful with it. This vial can be the death of you.]]></string>
<string id="536086"><![CDATA[You know what? Please come back tomorrow—and tomorrow we'll talk about it once more. Tomorrow everything will change… It's about many various intertwining plots and agendas. As for now, I don't have a panacea. Sorry.]]></string>
<string id="536087"><![CDATA[Yeah, people say the thief has her way of making others part with their belongings…]]></string>
<string id="536088"><![CDATA[Damn it!]]></string>
<string id="536089"><![CDATA[Fine. I'll come back tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="536090"><![CDATA[You've let me down, Lara…]]></string>
<string id="536091"><![CDATA[By the way, do you by any chance know the unit number of the troops that have been sent here?]]></string>
<string id="536092"><![CDATA[No, I don't.]]></string>
<string id="536093"><![CDATA[I'm surprised you're even asking.]]></string>
<string id="536094"><![CDATA[My father… was an officer.]]></string>

<string id="536108"><![CDATA[Both.]]></string>
<string id="536109"><![CDATA[Take the boosters first. Just be careful—they're deadly in large doses… Sooner or later you'll start feeling dizzy—those are the first symptoms of the disease. Eventually, the fever will become unbearable… that will be the disease entering its critical phase.]]></string>
<string id="536110"><![CDATA[I know that.]]></string>
<string id="536111"><![CDATA[The latent stage is not life-threatening, but in such an environment, where one will breathe the disease and absorb it through his pores constantly, the infection will progress rapidly. Take the antibiotics then. They will kill off the bacterium when it propagates too much.]]></string>

<string id="536126"><![CDATA[Hm… Our kind volunteers are prone to foul play… I've had reports of the kind of talks happening between them. Honestly, if they vanish, I'll be convinced that they just made off with the pills…]]></string>

<string id="536132"><![CDATA[Just dropping in to check on you.]]></string>
<string id="536133"><![CDATA[Just spare me any surprises, will you? When I find myself in want of your help, I'll ask for it explicitly. ]]></string>
<string id="536134"><![CDATA[You are mistaken. I know inquisitors well enough.]]></string>
<string id="536135"><![CDATA[...At least I will fulfill my obligation to the Powers That Be and save my Thanatica. ]]></string>
<string id="536136"><![CDATA[I do. They'll fail, rest assured.]]></string>
<string id="536137"><![CDATA[You can rely on me—I'll try to stop the villains... at least some villains, anyway.]]></string>
<string id="536138"><![CDATA[Come again? What did you say? Although… it doesn't matter now anyway.]]></string>
<string id="536139"><![CDATA[Nothing much. It's amazing how I haven't turned grey with horror. That thing was really made of... shabnak knows what. ]]></string>
<string id="536140"><![CDATA[See! And you said you didn't believe in shabnak! So, why didn't you kill it? ]]></string>
<string id="536141"><![CDATA[I'm pretty sure it wasn't the carrier. It didn't even seem to have blood at all.]]></string>
<string id="536142"><![CDATA[The generation part is important, isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="536143"><![CDATA[Yes. Don't you worry. ]]></string>
<string id="536144"><![CDATA[I want to buy something… less than legal from you.]]></string>
<string id="536145"><![CDATA[Far-off bells always ring sweet…]]></string>
<string id="536146"><![CDATA[How so?]]></string>
<string id="536147"><![CDATA[Show me the body please. I want to see it myself.]]></string>
<string id="536148"><![CDATA[Finally! The operation's been a success, I hope?]]></string>
<string id="536149"><![CDATA[That depends on the result.]]></string>
<string id="536150"><![CDATA[It was—if such dubious endeavour can be called an operation at all…]]></string>
<string id="536151"><![CDATA[The microscope is at your service, colleague. May you be the first to make the discovery!]]></string>
<string id="536152"><![CDATA[Much obliged.]]></string>
<string id="536153"><![CDATA[It's a deal.]]></string>
<string id="536154"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="536155"><![CDATA[My field of enquiry is ever the same. I am testing a theory which concerns what I refer to as the Trip Wires of Fate. You know I am a bit of a fatalist, don't you? Anyway, in order to further test my hypothesis, I will require your assistance with one of my enterprises. Apart from its sheer scientific value, this whole business will rid Lara Ravel of whatever is troubling her. Moreover, with a little bit of luck, an innocent life will be saved.]]></string>
<string id="536156"><![CDATA[Oh really?]]></string>
<string id="536157"><![CDATA[Wait till you hear this one. Lara Ravel conspires to assassinate the Commander. She is so naïve, our Lara; barely able to keep her operation a secret. Half the town is aware that she seeks to purchase a firearm. No one would sell her one, of course. ]]></string>
<string id="536158"><![CDATA[That's some news...]]></string>
<string id="536159"><![CDATA[Just wait till you've heard it all. The Commander was informed—by some unknown benefactor—that there will be an attempt on him soon. Along with everything else, the note contained a request: if the assassin proves to be a woman, she must not be killed. The weapon of the assassin, the note said, will be a harmless toy, and whoever wields it will not deserve anything more than a short-term imprisonment.]]></string>
<string id="536160"><![CDATA[And why has she chosen such a target?]]></string>
<string id="536161"><![CDATA[And how do you know about the anonymous letter? Or are you its author?]]></string>
<string id="536162"><![CDATA[Ludicrous, is it not? The man was wounded four times at the Karstov Fords, which did nothing to impede him. He emerged a victor, regardless of the grenade fragment which sat bone-deep in his flesh. And there she is, expecting a hero as such to be killed by a pellet which would hardly suffice to put a dent in his uniform.]]></string>
<string id="536163"><![CDATA[That's not what I meant. What's her problem with the Commander?]]></string>
<string id="536164"><![CDATA[And how do you know…. what you said about the bullet?]]></string>
<string id="536165"><![CDATA[Just as I told you; half the town knows the situation in detail. Worst of all, the Commander himself may learn any moment... The Changeling seems to be omnipresent... and frightfully quick to claim the ear of General Ashes. If only I was able to see through the motives of her actions!]]></string>
<string id="536166"><![CDATA[Perhaps she believes that he represents a kind of universal evil? An ultimate annihilator who has arrived with the only purpose of reducing the town to rubble. If only he was killed, Lara thinks, it would provide us with a much needed delay. After all, the medicine was already researched, she thinks... Was it, though?]]></string>
<string id="536167"><![CDATA[I don't know. ]]></string>
<string id="536168"><![CDATA[What shall we do then?]]></string>
<string id="536169"><![CDATA[I can't recall the gist of the theory very well. I might have missed something.]]></string>
<string id="536170"><![CDATA[It is well known that Block is as chivalrous as they come. If the hapless assassin is guaranteed safety, the unknown correspondent has promised to let the Commander know the name of the culprit and therefore spare him the tiresome necessity to seize every single person to appear within firing range. I don't think you would be too disappointed to learn that the letter was written by none other than Anna.]]></string>
<string id="536171"><![CDATA[That dirty creature!]]></string>
<string id="536172"><![CDATA[Don't be too harsh on her. She's a thespian; a child, eager to entertain her whims. The assassination will be an utter fiasco. The military will be forewarned and the gun that Lara has obtained will not fire. They will treat Lara as they treat women they believe to be hysterical or deranged. They are going to lock her up.]]></string>
<string id="536173"><![CDATA[So what is your plan?]]></string>
<string id="536174"><![CDATA[Why would you insinuate such a thing? I had absolutely nothing to do with the letter. It was someone else; someone very involved with this whole affair. Just like the rest of the parties, this person acts in good faith and conscience.]]></string>
<string id="536175"><![CDATA[Including the informer? I doubt you can convince me of that.]]></string>
<string id="536176"><![CDATA[But what does Anna have to gain from this? What is her deal? No, Yulia, you're not being entirely honest…]]></string>
<string id="536177"><![CDATA[Ask her, if you don't believe me. Anna's eccentricity is borderline hysterical. She is scared, perhaps, and eager to get on the good side of whoever she believes to be holding the most authority. ]]></string>
<string id="536178"><![CDATA[Yulia, I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. You are obviously hiding something. I'm not assisting you with this.]]></string>
<string id="536179"><![CDATA[Very well. But what does this have to do with testing your fatalistic theories?]]></string>
<string id="536180"><![CDATA[Under house arrest? And what if they shoot you?]]></string>
<string id="536181"><![CDATA[The man who won the Battle of the Fords is going to shoot me? Don't be ridiculous. I have nothing at all to fear from him.]]></string>
<string id="536182"><![CDATA[...Because you are a fatalist, and not afraid of death, right? Don't lie to me, Yulia. This is dangerous.]]></string>
<string id="536183"><![CDATA[This is the best option, still. I know Lara too well; no one will be able to stop her. She will find a gun sooner or later... On the other hand—your cooperation may net you Anna's panacea in addition to my own, since Anna was the third person offered a vial. ]]></string>
<string id="536184"><![CDATA[I don't know… It still doesn't seem like the brightest of ideas.]]></string>
<string id="536185"><![CDATA[You think so?]]></string>
<string id="536186"><![CDATA[There's no reason to worry. This whole affair will hurt no one. Quite the opposite, in fact; everyone will benefit from it. Everyone—including yourself. I don't really need this vial of panacea, you see, I may be very easily persuaded to hand it over.]]></string>
<string id="536187"><![CDATA[Your new friends fired at me.]]></string>
<string id="536188"><![CDATA[Did they now? And you were perfectly able to defend yourself, I presume?]]></string>
<string id="536189"><![CDATA[Yes. All of them are dead.]]></string>
<string id="536190"><![CDATA[Yulia, just be honest with me, why are you doing this?]]></string>
<string id="536191"><![CDATA[...My calculations were compromised by a factor I could not anticipate. Apparently it's best not to involve you in any affairs that have to do with fate and the diversity of its manifestations. I owe you a vial of panacea, then, don't I? ]]></string>
<string id="536192"><![CDATA[Please, don't trouble yourself.]]></string>
<string id="536193"><![CDATA[I think you are a very cunning woman, Yulia.]]></string>
<string id="536194"><![CDATA[Nothing special. The soldiers outside are amiable fellows—they even gave a salute in my honour.]]></string>
<string id="536195"><![CDATA[Well, well…  Do go on! Your words are music to my ears!]]></string>
<string id="536196"><![CDATA[You know, Vlad the Younger recently went through a dramatic metamorphosis! His eyes burn bright, his words are brave, his acts so noble—it all paints a great picture of him. He used to be a cynical leech, and now he is a hero. So why wouldn't I follow his example? Give away what little I have left? Count me in!]]></string>
<string id="536197"><![CDATA[Commendable, Anna. But how are you going to do that?]]></string>
<string id="536198"><![CDATA[Well, I have procured what Lara asked for. Voila! A small weapon of self-defense. Oh no, no need to thank me, I got it practically for free... you know, from the previous owner. But there's more! If you deliver this present to Lara anonymously, I will gladly give away the most valuable thing I own—my panacea!]]></string>
<string id="536199"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="536200"><![CDATA[Lara needs it for self-defense, she's afraid of the soldiers. You must give it to her in secret, no questions asked and… no names mentioned. When you deliver the pistol to Lara, come back for your reward. I don't mind parting with it anymore.]]></string>
<string id="536201"><![CDATA[An uneasy conscience betrays itself, Anna. This is another folk saying.]]></string>
<string id="536202"><![CDATA[I know all about your scheming. Explain yourself now. And no trying to weasel your way out of it!]]></string>
<string id="536203"><![CDATA[...There's no other way to stop our precious little Lara. Have you spoken with her? There you go! You see, she is slightly out of it. If I don't give her this toy, she's just going to get a real one… and fire it. Better she be arrested by our noble General Ashes than shot by the guards.]]></string>
<string id="536204"><![CDATA[Who are you talking to, Lara?]]></string>
<string id="536205"><![CDATA[I know everything, madam! What's with the insane fantasies?]]></string>
<string id="536206"><![CDATA[Ah, thwarted again! Please, at least don't report me…]]></string>
<string id="536207"><![CDATA[But why?]]></string>
<string id="536208"><![CDATA[He is a war criminal! All his fame is nothing but lies! Hearsay would have him as some kind of faultless knight, but in reality he's a bloodthirsty butcher! And we'll all find that out soon enough… but by then it will be too late…]]></string>
<string id="536209"><![CDATA[I've asked everybody, even the Changeling! You know that tiny pistol she carries around? That looks very handy. It's just what I need… But she wouldn't give it to me. She said she has plans for me, that she requires my life.]]></string>
<string id="536210"><![CDATA[And why do you need a pistol?]]></string>
<string id="536211"><![CDATA[I can't tell you… I just want a weapon! Yes, I'm scared of the soldiers. But it really has to be small, like Clara's—I won't be able to handle a big one, so I'll miss... I'll reward you, I'll give you whatever it may cost. Here, I saved up…]]></string>
<string id="536212"><![CDATA[Lara, I don't like this at all.]]></string>
<string id="536217"><![CDATA[Yes… it depends. Some can take the life out of you with a few dried peas.]]></string>
<string id="536218"><![CDATA[So your life is what you're going to risk, isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="536220"><![CDATA[Oh, it's not like you're my husband or older brother, are you now? If you won't bring it to me, I'll just ask the Haruspex, he's less squeamish. And I can give you a very rare and valuable thing in exchange. That thing from yesterday… remember?]]></string>
<string id="536221"><![CDATA[Fine. I'll get you a pistol.]]></string>
<string id="536222"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="536225"><![CDATA[I've had a very exhausting day—and I'm not the only one here who has, I suspect… We would all be better off if we had some rest. Let us talk business in the morning.]]></string>
<string id="536226"><![CDATA[All right.]]></string>
<string id="536227"><![CDATA[I have other plans for the night.]]></string>
<string id="536228"><![CDATA[Don't be so fast to judge.]]></string>
<string id="536229"><![CDATA[Indeed. Walking the streets of your town at night has been an entirely unpleasant experience since my first day here.]]></string>
<string id="536230"><![CDATA[So you were expecting something? A calamity?]]></string>
<string id="536231"><![CDATA[There were dreams… devoid of images. But tonight I saw a fragment of one of the days to come.]]></string>
<string id="536232"><![CDATA[…All these years I've been dreading war more than anything.]]></string>
<string id="536233"><![CDATA[I heard you were offering a reward for exterminating the barbers?]]></string>
<string id="536234"><![CDATA[And what does it entail?]]></string>
<string id="536235"><![CDATA[A lot. In truth, I have never made such a promise before. My mother has… just twice, I think… and kept it both times. And because she was a Mistress, it meant that the wish could be anything. A Mistress would find a way to fulfill it.]]></string>
<string id="536236"><![CDATA[Your mother did this twice? Why?]]></string>
<string id="536237"><![CDATA[…This is not really something we talk about. I will tell you, but l'll do so later. For now, I'm not allowed to… and neither can I give such a promise. I just couldn't help myself; it was a lapse of the tongue.]]></string>
<string id="536238"><![CDATA[So what exactly happened back then?]]></string>
<string id="536239"><![CDATA[Spoken words are like flown birds, Maria. Neither can be recalled.]]></string>
<string id="536240"><![CDATA[I don't need your reward. I'll fight the robbers because my principles dictate so.]]></string>
<string id="536244"><![CDATA[That sounds mighty suspicious.]]></string>
<string id="536245"><![CDATA[That would be redundant in your case. Your—how did you put it?—virtues are already a sight to see.]]></string>
<string id="536246"><![CDATA[...Anna, are you really that stupid, or is this just you acting?]]></string>
<string id="536247"><![CDATA[Fair enough... Not only are you a hypocrite, you are an idiot too... ]]></string>
<string id="536248"><![CDATA[Pardon me? You've thrown me off a bit…]]></string>
<string id="536249"><![CDATA[What are you up to?]]></string>
<string id="536250"><![CDATA[So you say your pistol is only a toy? Dubious, all of this…]]></string>
<string id="536251"><![CDATA[Why inform on her then?]]></string>
<string id="536252"><![CDATA[Oh, the wisest of bachelors, you really have no idea… There's one more actor on this stage. And what an actor she is—a prima donna! I could never outdo her. It's Yulia. She was the first to find out, and wanted to fix it so that everything would seem to be my fault. So I had to tell the truth. She would have had me otherwise.]]></string>
<string id="536253"><![CDATA[Then why the secrecy? I was told the letters were sent anonymously.]]></string>
<string id="536254"><![CDATA[So I'll talk to Yulia. And then I'll get back to you. Maybe. Depending on the result.]]></string>
<string id="536255"><![CDATA[Take it. I just happen to have one.]]></string>
<string id="536256"><![CDATA[Are you saying you have no need of that thing anymore? And why would that be? No, Lara. I need you alive. Don't even think about getting a firearm.]]></string>
<string id="536257"><![CDATA[Yes, that's exactly the kind I needed. Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="536258"><![CDATA[Good luck, Lara Ravel.]]></string>
<string id="536259"><![CDATA[Someone already has, Lara. You won't accomplish anything.]]></string>
<string id="536260"><![CDATA[But who did it? And more importantly, why? He is an evil demon, he deserved this…]]></string>
<string id="536261"><![CDATA[It's the Changeling and her hidden plots. You shouldn't have trusted her.]]></string>
<string id="536262"><![CDATA[Anna Angel. Your choice of friends is imprudent.]]></string>
<string id="536263"><![CDATA[Your plot has been exposed. Praise the heavens that your name remains a secret for now.]]></string>
<string id="536264"><![CDATA[You still don't realize who the real demon is…]]></string>
<string id="536265"><![CDATA[So you decided to make an attempt on him? Very well. Go ahead and try. But you may come to regret it.]]></string>
<string id="536266"><![CDATA[A panacea? I won't take it. Farewell, Lara.]]></string>
<string id="536267"><![CDATA[Unfortunately I cannot boast the same.]]></string>

<string id="536279"><![CDATA[The Theatre is closed for the public. We await further orders from you.]]></string>
<string id="536280"><![CDATA[They're simple. Bring the infected here before their disease enters critical stage. Take care of them according to my instructions.]]></string>
<string id="536281"><![CDATA[Will do. Anything else?]]></string>
<string id="536282"><![CDATA[Obviously, you also need to arrange for the dead bodies to be transported to the cemetery and buried.]]></string>

<string id="536284"><![CDATA[The Cathedral is closed. We await your orders.]]></string>
<string id="536285"><![CDATA[My orders are simple. Any person who, for whatever reason, has entered an infected district, is to come here. Keep track of them. If there are no signs of infection after four hours, let them go.]]></string>
<string id="536286"><![CDATA[And if there are?]]></string>
<string id="536287"><![CDATA[Take them outside immediately and have them wait for the sanitary party. Apply antiseptics and give an antibiotic to anyone who was near the infected.]]></string>
<string id="536288"><![CDATA[Act as the situation demands.]]></string>
<string id="536289"><![CDATA[I've already seen everything I need.]]></string>
<string id="536290"><![CDATA[Yes, two even. I think it's going to be very crowded here soon… Do you know there's been some strange sabotage? Someone ruined the town's water supply, and drinking from the river doesn't feel safe nowadays…]]></string>
<string id="536291"><![CDATA[Above all, you must prevent any contact between the quarantined and other people. Even their families.]]></string>
<string id="536292"><![CDATA[Will do, sir. Anything else?]]></string>
<string id="536293"><![CDATA[Can the Cathedral be locked from the outside?]]></string>
<string id="536294"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="536295"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="536296"><![CDATA[Then keep it locked. And reinforce the guard. The quarantined must not leave the building before the designated time. Expect rioting.]]></string>
<string id="536297"><![CDATA[You can let people inside until we start getting the first potentially infected. I forbid entry after that.]]></string>
<string id="536298"><![CDATA[You're right. It's best to avoid drinking from the river for now.]]></string>
<string id="536299"><![CDATA[I disagree. It's safe to drink water from the river, it just needs to be boiled.]]></string>

<string id="536318"><![CDATA[*** The district is hazardous still, but for reasons other than the disease. Fortunately, the looters are much easier to get rid of. This district will be repopulated soon, as will many other ones. What Victor did is a laudable accomplishment, no less.]]></string>

Please find a moment to discuss a certain idea with me.

<string id="536332"><![CDATA[Simon is alive! I just saw him suddenly appear at the Crucible! I sense him, you know, I can't ignore it… I woke up, but the feeling refused to let go of me… He's there, he is still there! It was all a lie, an illusion! Rubin will back up my words.]]></string>
<string id="536333"><![CDATA[I don't understand. Why Rubin?]]></string>
<string id="536334"><![CDATA[Rubin must tell the truth… he never lies if you make him swear on his Master's name… He will tell you then that he never dissected the body. Simon is at the Crucible! It was all an illusion, a deception!]]></string>
<string id="536335"><![CDATA[Why would somebody arrange such a deception?]]></string>
<string id="536336"><![CDATA[Illusions… The Kains engineered the epidemic… then hid it behind a false murder… Simon is at the Crucible, I know he is—and I will have proof. If you won't do it, I'll stoop to asking the Changeling… And even the Haruspex if she refuses too! Aglaya will heed their words... more willingly than she would heed mine... And she needs to know.]]></string>

<string id="536341"><![CDATA[There are already half a thousand people who have agreed to leave the infected districts for the Cathedral. It's you who they owe their lives to, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="536342"><![CDATA[You've mentioned complications.]]></string>
<string id="536343"><![CDATA[There are food issues. We still have enough water, but the people are starving. The crowd is beginning to get cranky. They demand to be allowed to go search for food in the clean districts.]]></string>
<string id="536344"><![CDATA[And I demand they don't. Don't let anyone out. Direct orders from me.]]></string>
<string id="536345"><![CDATA[I'll speak to Olgimsky. You will be getting food supplies.]]></string>
<string id="536346"><![CDATA[If you let anyone out, the whole idea of an isolation ward goes down the drain. Tell them we're almost done with the vaccine. They only need to wait a little longer—two days at most.]]></string>

<string id="536348"><![CDATA[I. I'm almost done with the vaccine.]]></string>

<string id="536357"><![CDATA[When the Cathedral gets overcrowded, we'll find another place. For what it's worth, we can use the structure on the other side of the river—even though it's usually off-limits.]]></string>

Once again I was pleasantly surprised by your insight. Did you ever consider becoming an Inquisitor yourself?

We have to conclude the conversation we held yesterday and to decide who our real enemy is, and what the target of our next strike should be. The goals are consistent, I think. It rots from within.

Waiting for you at the Cathedral,

<string id="536368"><![CDATA[Bachelor,

I sincerely urge you to see me at the Willows as soon as you can. We have serious business that needs taking care of. Pay no heed to those slandering me—everything is different now! The fact of the matter is, we have an opportunity to save the life of one of your closest associates.

A. A. A.]]></string>

<string id="536370"><![CDATA[Allow me to invite you to the Trammel, Bachelor. For your own benefit, of course, since the matter I'd like to discuss has a bearing on yesterday's happenings. Make haste, Bachelor, time is of the essence. Three more parties are playing this particular game and we may easily find ourselves outpaced.

I urge you to put off all secondary matters that are dividing your attention. There is no time to spare. My hands are tied by General Ashes.

Remember, we must hurry if we are to cease the outbreak and avoid unnecessary casualties. The muzzles of their artillery are still obedient to the voice of reason.

Looking forward to meeting you at the Cathedral as soon as possible,

<string id="536380"><![CDATA[…Again your words make no sense. Just like when we met for the first time.]]></string>
<string id="536381"><![CDATA[My God, you're doing it again… That's it, I have had enough!]]></string>
<string id="536382"><![CDATA[You say you can feel his presence, but if Simon is alive, why weren't you feeling it all this time? Surely he couldn't have risen from the dead?]]></string>
<string id="536385"><![CDATA[One would certainly think so… Katerina, you're on the verge of real madness. The whole town is. And I, a champion of reason, fear madness over anything else! Farewell.]]></string>
<string id="536386"><![CDATA[I do not know myself… I would never mislead you… why would I? We the Saburovs are done for… We were the first to suffer Clara's punishing hand… whoever wins, we shall never again rise from the ashes… and still I say to you—he is there! This is for you…]]></string>
<string id="536387"><![CDATA[No! No! That's exactly why the Kains are so abhorrent… Any fantasy that only has the right to exist in the realm of dreams, they give substance. It's as if they're just bringing all those illusions, all the vastness available to the human imagination, into this world!]]></string>
<string id="536388"><![CDATA[What's so abhorrent about that? They deserve praise… worship even… if this is actually true.]]></string>
<string id="536389"><![CDATA[Simon is, to a certain extent, a concept… That much I have concluded by now. Which means your words can be taken very much as an allegory.]]></string>
<string id="536390"><![CDATA[Oh yes! Look around and see the fruits of that worship! No, they have no place on this earth! I speak as the protector of the weak! I speak on their behalf! When those such as them begin to create, the weak are always the first to suffer. Everything the Kains do is a challenge, and challenges are for the strong! How are the rest of us supposed to live?]]></string>
<string id="536391"><![CDATA[You speak on behalf of puppets. Let the weak become strong then.]]></string>
<string id="536392"><![CDATA[There's no compassion in you… so ruthless… how can you be so? Even Burakh, that dreadful ripper destined to drown us all in blood… even he has more compassion for people than you.]]></string>
<string id="536393"><![CDATA[What do you want from me, Katerina?]]></string>
<string id="536394"><![CDATA[Fine. But why are you so upset?]]></string>
<string id="536395"><![CDATA[Yeah, his compassion is evident. The crow bewails the sheep, and then eats it.]]></string>
<string id="536396"><![CDATA[Indeed. Whenever an exceptional feat is achieved, the dregs are forced to compare their whole lives with its greatness… not a simple challenge.]]></string>
<string id="536397"><![CDATA[Wait, there are several dead in there now?]]></string>
<string id="536398"><![CDATA[Why, blasphemy, of course… Or do you still not realize the fate that befell Simon?]]></string>
<string id="536399"><![CDATA[Tell me the truth, Rubin. Is Simon alive? ]]></string>
<string id="536400"><![CDATA[What do you mean? Simon is dead. Certainly dead, now. Although he was alive… for all the while he was thought to be dead.]]></string>
<string id="536401"><![CDATA[Then your transgression is not so great, colleague.]]></string>
<string id="536402"><![CDATA[Farewell, Rubin.]]></string>
<string id="536403"><![CDATA[How are you certain that the man whose body you took was Simon Kain?]]></string>
<string id="536404"><![CDATA[You think I don't know what Simon looked like? You think his greatness, his noble visage, is comparable to his brother or anyone else? After all, if it wasn't his superhuman blood, who else's could fight the disease for so long and almost beat it, even if at the cost of lethargy? Whose? Can you tell me?]]></string>
<string id="536405"><![CDATA[Understand that in all my time here I have never—not even once—seen Simon; the only man I hoped to meet here! I never saw him alive, never saw him dead! What do you expect me to believe?]]></string>
<string id="536406"><![CDATA[Fine. Ask at the Crucible! Since they let me go, they clearly don't think of me as either a murderer, or as a blasphemer! Let them explain where Simon is! I've said all I can!]]></string>
<string id="536407"><![CDATA[By the name of your Master, Rubin, answer me... did you tell the truth? ]]></string>
<string id="536408"><![CDATA[I don't. I feel like I'm still missing something.]]></string>
<string id="536409"><![CDATA[Katerina Saburova came back from another soujourn with the spirits and declared that Simon has arisen in The Crucible. Just now. She's hysterical.]]></string>
<string id="536410"><![CDATA[Hm… well, Katerina is… That Clara did something to her… took her power and her crown as a Mistress. Are you certain that she said that? It's impossible. I broke Simon down into tiny particles with my own hands, and turned him into the white vaccine.]]></string>
<string id="536411"><![CDATA[Dear colleague, I stole the body from the Kains—the body that was sacred to them. With my own hands I took Simon Kain's life… if that state could be called life, that is. Finally, the body itself, in which Georgiy had some… uh… scientific interest… I evaporated it.]]></string>
<string id="536412"><![CDATA[What do you mean—evaporated? I've just received positive information that he's alive.]]></string>
<string id="536413"><![CDATA[I turned him into the vaccine. I literally saturated the town with him. Maybe that is what's being implied by your…. source, whose identity I could guess? He lives on in the hearts of those for whom he gave his life. Didn't I explain it to your back then, four days ago? Do you still not understand?]]></string>
<string id="536414"><![CDATA[Katerina says that Simon is alive.]]></string>
<string id="536415"><![CDATA[Thank you. Your word is sufficient.]]></string>
<string id="536416"><![CDATA[No. You are a truly beautiful woman, Maria. ]]></string>
<string id="536417"><![CDATA[Katerina is preparing an attack on you. She will use the imaginary murder of Simon to claim... that your family is who stands behind the plague.]]></string>
<string id="536418"><![CDATA[...I am, en-Daniil. You are a man of honour. ]]></string>
<string id="536419"><![CDATA[Maria, tell me... Maria, have you always been frank with me?]]></string>
<string id="536420"><![CDATA[You are the only person I've always been frank with, en-Daniil. This is probably because out meeting was so strange... and we have spent too little time together... You are the only one I've always been honest with... and I will keep being honest with you, en-Daniil. I don't want to lie to you.]]></string>
<string id="536421"><![CDATA[Maria, tell me... Is it true that Simon is alive? ]]></string>
<string id="536422"><![CDATA[...Not quite. It's complicated… But you're not going to believe me anyway… It's a pity that you've come to know our family at this horrible time. None of us is in tune with their true nature these days… Hopefully you haven't yet talked to… haven't been to the right wing. The wing where my father used to live.]]></string>
<string id="536423"><![CDATA[What's going on with you all, Maria?]]></string>
<string id="536424"><![CDATA[You sound like a somnambulist—and remind me of Katerina.]]></string>
<string id="536425"><![CDATA[All right. Talk to my dear... to my father. Just don't be surprised by anything. And do not ask unnecessary questions. He's a bit out of it… But they can… he can offer good advice.]]></string>
<string id="536426"><![CDATA[Fine, I'll do just that.]]></string>
<string id="536427"><![CDATA[I need to see Georgiy. Why is his door locked? ]]></string>
<string id="536428"><![CDATA[I need explanations now. The accusations you family is facing are too grave.]]></string>
<string id="536429"><![CDATA[We are innocent before our town. Nobody has ever done so much for the people as we have. Just wait some more until I awaken—and I shall explain it to you.]]></string>
<string id="536430"><![CDATA[I trust you... But would those who want to see you fall do likewise?]]></string>
<string id="536431"><![CDATA[Our family is staring it in the face. The plague is an attack on us. It was us—not anyone else—who have become its main victims… You will see. Katerina already has… which is why she's running rampant… she's already lost her power. She has transferred it to someone else... and I don't mean Clara...]]></string>
<string id="536432"><![CDATA[…Katerina is also planning to seek the Inquisitor's support—and a trial for you…]]></string>
<string id="536433"><![CDATA[I see it would be better not to disturb you now.]]></string>
<string id="536434"><![CDATA[Is it true that Simon Kain is alive? ]]></string>
<string id="536435"><![CDATA[But what do you call life?]]></string>
<string id="536436"><![CDATA[Strange… Throughout my career, I've answered that question numerous times… but now I don't know what to tell you.]]></string>
<string id="536437"><![CDATA[Do you believe in the soul's immortality?]]></string>
<string id="536438"><![CDATA[Yes, I do.]]></string>
<string id="536439"><![CDATA[So you want to know the truth about Simon? So be it. You will. The truth is that Georgiy Kain, who so ardently desired eternal life for his brother, has committed himself in entirety to Simon's Memory. He is imbued completely with memories of him. That is what Katerina saw... but she is very sloppy with her visions.]]></string>
<string id="536440"><![CDATA[Victor, I—]]></string>
<string id="536441"><![CDATA[Ha ha ha… forgive me this inappropriate laughter. I'm too unused to this. And I don't want to get used to it because this state will not continue for long. So you—]]></string>
<string id="536442"><![CDATA[I have heard that Simon Kain is alive. Is that true?]]></string>
<string id="536443"><![CDATA[What state? ]]></string>
<string id="536444"><![CDATA[Do you know of that which we call Memory?]]></string>
<string id="536445"><![CDATA[Yes, I think I have the basic idea.]]></string>
<string id="536446"><![CDATA[No. I don't believe in it.]]></string>
<string id="536447"><![CDATA[Why, then, did you ask me that question about Simon?]]></string>
<string id="536448"><![CDATA[Katerina was in a frenzy. She is convinced that Simon is at The Crucible.]]></string>
<string id="536449"><![CDATA[Ah, so that's why! Tell me, did Katerina only talk about Simon? Only him? And you say she was in a frenzy? Did she not notice the presence of another person at The Crucible, the very thought of whom should make the girl tremble?]]></string>
<string id="536451"><![CDATA[Life is any state of a human being that is different from death.]]></string>
<string id="536452"><![CDATA[I'm not sure.]]></string>
<string id="536453"><![CDATA[Memory is the very fine particles of a person that exist between that which is the person and all that isn't. Some have the ability to collect those particles. For as long as people are able to retain the particles inside themselves, the person is not dead. They remain here, but their soul is not imprisoned. It flies off to where it's supposed to be.]]></string>
<string id="536454"><![CDATA[I understand now.]]></string>
<string id="536459"><![CDATA[No. She spoke only of Simon]]></string>
<string id="536461"><![CDATA[I want to know where Simon Kain is now. ]]></string>
<string id="536462"><![CDATA[...Who are you? ]]></string>
<string id="536463"><![CDATA[You cannot know the answer to this question. Had my daughter not fallen in love with you, you wouldn't have been allowed to ask even the questions you've asked so far. Why have you come here, Bachelor Dankovsky?]]></string>
<string id="536464"><![CDATA[I want to know the truth about Simon. ]]></string>
<string id="536466"><![CDATA[I think I'm beginning to understand…]]></string>
<string id="536467"><![CDATA[If Katerina starts spreading rumours of Simon's return, tell them Georgiy has gone mad. That he imagines himself to be Simon and Katerina is sensing those waves… Talk to Georgiy; let him confirm his consent to being presented as a madman.]]></string>
<string id="536468"><![CDATA[Will he talk to me?]]></string>
<string id="536469"><![CDATA[...You really have no idea how much has changed. The cost of shutting up mouths is now several times greater.]]></string>
<string id="536470"><![CDATA[Yes, you are exactly as I imagined. My boy, when Isidor described you to me… I knew that this is the way I would like my heir to be. Alas, I have never begotten one. I am not the first Kain to lack a son, and, regrettably, not the last.]]></string>
<string id="536471"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="536472"><![CDATA[I think this is the price we pay for leaving too much life in our wake. Life that is lush, blooming, unpredictable and unrestrained. The soul that could have belonged to our children is dissolved in our man-made legacy.]]></string>

<string id="536478"><![CDATA[Beyound a shadow of doubt, this is a man, not a boy standing before me. So why is this man here?]]></string>
<string id="536479"><![CDATA[Judge! There is rumour in the town that Simon is alive and his supposed death was a ruse set by the Kains to disguise their involvement in this plague outbreak.]]></string>

<string id="536482"><![CDATA[What have you done to yourself, Judge? ]]></string>
<string id="536483"><![CDATA[You know what I did; you will see if you look well enough. But that's not really the question, is it? What you really want to know is why.]]></string>
<string id="536484"><![CDATA[Yes. ]]></string>
<string id="536485"><![CDATA[No. I know why.]]></string>
<string id="536486"><![CDATA[I do not know. For some reason it seems to me that this Changeling, Clara, can be of help here.]]></string>
<string id="536487"><![CDATA[I have extremely valuable information. Where do you imagine Simon Kain currently is?]]></string>
<string id="536488"><![CDATA[Partly in heaven and partly in the ground, I suppose. Why? You have reason to believe otherwise?]]></string>
<string id="536489"><![CDATA[You should know that Georgiy Kain has gone insane. He believes himself to be Simon. He will possibly die soon. Victor too.]]></string>
<string id="536490"><![CDATA[It seems to me that Simon is alive. ]]></string>
<string id="536491"><![CDATA[I don't believe that. Out of the question. I don't even want to hear about it. Don't make me disappointed, I beg of you.]]></string>
<string id="536493"><![CDATA[I have told you what I intended to.  Draw your own conclusions.]]></string>
<string id="536494"><![CDATA[Is that so… Well, that changes everything. I will of course draw my own conclusions; in fact, I am doing so right now. The information is indeed extremely valuable. I will even allow myself to appraise their precise price tag. However, it wouldn't be very nice for two crafty people like us to outwit each other. Wouldn't you agree?]]></string>
<string id="536495"><![CDATA[The impression is all over the place, to be blunt.]]></string>
<string id="536496"><![CDATA[I wholeheartedly agree. It's turning into a bedlam, wouldn't you agree? I can feel it here all too well—still can't get used to the piquancy of the whole ordeal… See for yourself—I've been thinking about leaving this place of the dead for a while now, but I get the feeling that this is exactly the place for me to fulfill my part...]]></string>
<string id="536497"><![CDATA[Why did you want to see me? ]]></string>
<string id="536498"><![CDATA[To confirm your sharpest observation, actually… I've got competition now, as you can see. The lowest kind of it, I suppose. I am no tragedian myself—I'm rather a comedian—but this is a most grotesque and insane parody…]]></string>
<string id="536499"><![CDATA[And who is the competition?]]></string>
<string id="536500"><![CDATA[Some mob is trying to act out a… I'm not sure what to call it, it's not really a performance… well, they're trying to act out a living image of something by the Bone Stake. Although I'm not sure "living" is the best word—the centerpiece is a dying creature, after all.]]></string>
<string id="536501"><![CDATA[How is that competition?]]></string>
<string id="536502"><![CDATA[Everybody started to talk about it, interpreting and reinterpreting the… act. Just like they do with our very own Mask Act here. The prophetic excitement is growing by the hour… hand in hand with the anger.]]></string>
<string id="536503"><![CDATA[Anger? What are they angry about?]]></string>
<string id="536504"><![CDATA[I don't know. I only have the Executors' sardonic reports at the moment. I wouldn't have bothered you with this if not for the nasty smell coming from the detestable farce… Because, honestly, who would really believe that it was my epigones' doing? The mob thinks it's a heavenly portent, no less.]]></string>
<string id="536505"><![CDATA[Do you believe that I have gone mad? ]]></string>
<string id="536506"><![CDATA[No. But you have changed—and I'm surprised.]]></string>
<string id="536507"><![CDATA[I'm starting to think that I've been in a madhouse all this time.]]></string>
<string id="536508"><![CDATA[You're asking as though you owned the situation… I find it disturbing.]]></string>
<string id="536509"><![CDATA[Ah, I apologize... A nasty stage habit. Of course, I wouldn't in my wildest dreams dare… I wouldn't ever think about producing such a cheapjack and, if I may, tasteless play. So I had nothing to do with it. And let us forget the jests on the subject.]]></string>
<string id="536510"><![CDATA[Why did you want to see me? ]]></string>
<string id="536511"><![CDATA[Are they planning to lynch someone there once again?]]></string>
<string id="536512"><![CDATA[Did you see it? Was it impressive? ]]></string>
<string id="536513"><![CDATA[What is it? What am I supposed to make of it? You just wanted me to see it, didn't you?]]></string>
<string id="536514"><![CDATA[Hmmm... First of all, I have to confess that this is not my handiwork; on the contrary, it's a direct attack on my interests. It never even occurred to me that this could make an impression on you—let alone a positive one—but I wanted you to see how impressed the mob is.]]></string>
<string id="536515"><![CDATA[I'm afraid you're right. ]]></string>
<string id="536516"><![CDATA[No. The set is too poor. Although the beast is real—I've checked.]]></string>
<string id="536517"><![CDATA[There are several people there—each of them so noisy you could take them for a dozen.]]></string>
<string id="536518"><![CDATA[I think the Kains are.]]></string>
<string id="536519"><![CDATA[Actually, I don't care in the slightest. But you should. You are now at a timepoint when you cannot afford to not care—you've only got a day and a half left… I want that thing to end because I don't like their style. What about you?]]></string>
<string id="536520"><![CDATA[I do indeed care. It's dangerous. ]]></string>
<string id="536521"><![CDATA[But how can they be removed from there?]]></string>
<string id="536522"><![CDATA[I'd rather like to know who had arranged it.]]></string>
<string id="536523"><![CDATA[Why are you asking me? I wonder! Which irredeemable blockhead has gotten it into their blocky head to arrange such a performance? I don't know! I only know it resembles a bulldog throwing a recently-strangled cat on a festive table! The owners' beloved cat, I might add...]]></string>
<string id="536524"><![CDATA[You? ]]></string>
<string id="536525"><![CDATA[Oh please... Do you still view me in my former quality? No, I am no longer a mime show interpreter. That's too good for me. I voluntarily—you hear that? Voluntarily!—renounce the laurels of a destiny-maker. Except maybe a bit—for fun… eh?]]></string>
<string id="536526"><![CDATA[Who do you think fits the description best?]]></string>
<string id="536527"><![CDATA[Well, I don't. I've been embroiled into a stupid melodrama already—and now you want to embroil me into a farce? No way in hell.]]></string>
<string id="536528"><![CDATA[I don't know... I think it will resolve by itself somehow. And I have more pressing concerns.]]></string>
<string id="536529"><![CDATA[Who is the target then?]]></string>
<string id="536530"><![CDATA[Of course it's not.]]></string>
<string id="536531"><![CDATA[Let's hear what the smart man has to say.]]></string>
<string id="536532"><![CDATA[You are probably right.]]></string>
<string id="536533"><![CDATA[I sincerely hope you can. I have to admit—I'm furious. The directive I received from the top brass gave me very broad authority and the right to make strategic decisions. It made no mention of an inquisitor! And now this…]]></string>
<string id="536534"><![CDATA[What? ]]></string>
<string id="536535"><![CDATA[That is still unresolved. For many years now it has been an unspoken rule for military command to obey the decisions of an inquisitor. The justification was that an inquisitor would find a way to make a soldier obey their will anyway—whether the latter knows it or not.]]></string>
<string id="536536"><![CDATA[To be fair, until very recently, military commanders also left remarkably little room for illusions concerning themselves…]]></string>
<string id="536537"><![CDATA[But it's all different now! I am willing to cooperate, but she refuses to even meet with me. She has gathered information, not without your assistance I imagine, and now she's busy setting the gears in motion, waving me away until my gear is up for turning!]]></string>
<string id="536538"><![CDATA[What are you responsible for, commander?]]></string>
<string id="536539"><![CDATA[I hasten to report an issue of an utmost importance. There is a riot brewing in the poor districts.]]></string>
<string id="536540"><![CDATA[Let the Inquisitor deal with that. Riots are right up her alley. I wish no part in it. She won't share information with me, so I won't step onto her turf. I'm not being vindictive. I'd hate to disturb her arrangements.]]></string>
<string id="536541"><![CDATA[Certain special circumstances are in play, ones directly related to you responsibilities.]]></string>
<string id="536542"><![CDATA[No… something tells me that the Inquisitor will not deal with it.]]></string>
<string id="536543"><![CDATA[What is the scope of your duties?]]></string>
<string id="536544"><![CDATA[I am responsible for ensuring that the epidemic never spreads from here further. I am also responsible for the lives of my men. That is what I know for a fact.]]></string>
<string id="536545"><![CDATA[Your flamethrower corps are burning out everything infected, whether it moves or not. Is that within the scope of their jurisdiction?]]></string>
<string id="536546"><![CDATA[There is a giant decaying animal carcass in the middle of the poorer districts. Do you realize the consequences?]]></string>
<string id="536548"><![CDATA[I do.]]></string>
<string id="536549"><![CDATA[Absolutely.]]></string>
<string id="536550"><![CDATA[It's in the Bone Stake Lot—I see it marked on your map.]]></string>
<string id="536551"><![CDATA[Many interesting things for them to see on the Bone Stake Lot. I'd lead them in that particular direction if I were you.]]></string>
<string id="536552"><![CDATA[I understand you completely, commander. This is exactly what I wanted. Everyone performing their duty.]]></string>
<string id="536553"><![CDATA[No. The vigilante is a much more significant woman.]]></string>
<string id="536554"><![CDATA[I fear only one woman in this town. And if she chooses to try for my life, so long me. But I don't think she would use such extravagant means to achieve that end.]]></string>
<string id="536555"><![CDATA[Her name is Yulia Lyuricheva. She suffers from a neurotic condition.]]></string>
<string id="536556"><![CDATA[Fine. I'll send riflemen there immediately. Let her be under house arrest until I have time to make a closer acquaintance. ]]></string>
<string id="536557"><![CDATA[Yes. She is a singer, very eccentric. She often fails to realise where she is and mostly lives inside her own fantasy world.]]></string>
<string id="536558"><![CDATA[This woman has the intellect and willpower of a man. The owner of the Trammel manor, on the bluff in the Chine district.]]></string>
<string id="536559"><![CDATA[One more thing. The... gentler half of the town community is already... abuzz with the news. So should any overexcited lady come here... ]]></string>
<string id="536560"><![CDATA[I understand. She will be treated with utmost respect. I will talk to her and do my best to set her right. But if she turns violent, she will be locked up.]]></string>
<string id="536561"><![CDATA[We have—but it's all very sudden. Somehow I can't shake the feeling you knew beforehand…]]></string>
<string id="536562"><![CDATA[I'm not. It's all very clear.]]></string>
<string id="536563"><![CDATA[It's all clear as day. ]]></string>
<string id="536564"><![CDATA[In the Bone Stake Lot?]]></string>
<string id="536565"><![CDATA[In the Bone Stake Lot.]]></string>
<string id="536566"><![CDATA[No. I know nothing about it. ]]></string>
<string id="536567"><![CDATA[She is a witch. The Dark Mistress. Have you already heard about Nina and Victoria? Ask around. Then you'll see who Maria strives to be. She will turn into a warlock queen and make the town bend before her tyranny. Like Nina before her, only even more frightening. It can be proven.]]></string>
<string id="536568"><![CDATA[Tell me about Nina. ]]></string>
<string id="536569"><![CDATA[Nina was the embodiment of absolute evil. The charming, intoxicating, beautiful evil, the evil that can drive you mad. The graceful and elegant evil that is fast to capture anyone in its web—even those who stand up to evil till the very last.]]></string>
<string id="536570"><![CDATA["Pray forgive me," as one of our common friends likes to say. Quite a lot of outrageous events happened yesterday…]]></string>
<string id="536571"><![CDATA[Yes. Someone tried to incite a riot.]]></string>
<string id="536572"><![CDATA[The military have exterminated an unarmed mob. A perfectly healthy mob. This is the event I'm talking about. And I know for sure who was behind it—because I know who turned out to be guilty of this horrible crime… me! I was the one they framed!]]></string>
<string id="536573"><![CDATA[So who was behind it?]]></string>
<string id="536574"><![CDATA[The Kains, most likely. They have arranged this provocation and tied every loose end to me—as though it was I who's done it. They've done a splendid job. I couldn't have done better. That's because such things can only be done by a very special woman... it's about genetics as much as it is about skill...]]></string>
<string id="536575"><![CDATA[Maria? ]]></string>
<string id="536576"><![CDATA[I think we understand each other full well, Inquisitor. Everyone was doing their job. Everyone only knew what they were supposed to know. Supposed by you.]]></string>
<string id="536577"><![CDATA[You are mistaken. It was me.]]></string>
<string id="536578"><![CDATA[You? No. You only provided the military with the information… that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about those who have orchestrated this… mysteria. Undoubtedly, it was Maria. And this Mark, the impresario of the local Theatre, has given her a cue as to how.]]></string>
<string id="536579"><![CDATA[This is beyond Maria's capabilities. ]]></string>
<string id="536580"><![CDATA[Yesterday she was unconscious all day long. ]]></string>
<string id="536581"><![CDATA[Are you trying to say you're painting Maria's portrait? Considering they're supposedly alike?]]></string>
<string id="536582"><![CDATA[Who is it? ]]></string>
<string id="536583"><![CDATA[Olgimsky's son. The second is Maria's younger brother, little Kaspar, who also knows Maria's immediate plans better than anyone else. He is so terrified of them that he's ready to run to the ends of the earth…]]></string>
<string id="536584"><![CDATA[This is interesting... ]]></string>
<string id="536585"><![CDATA[By the way, if you want to talk to this Kaspar boy, please hand this panacea over to him. This vial was brought to me by Burakh yesterday, it's reliable. The boy will understand. Actually, after talking to him so will you…]]></string>
<string id="536586"><![CDATA[Damn... Me dealing with Olgimsky turned out to be so untimely…]]></string>
<string id="536587"><![CDATA[Who are you talking about, boy? ]]></string>
<string id="536588"><![CDATA[You should know that better than me. I am not going to help you with this.]]></string>
<string id="536589"><![CDATA[You hold a grudge against your sister? Why? ]]></string>
<string id="536590"><![CDATA[Sister forces us out from here. ]]></string>
<string id="536591"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="536592"><![CDATA[You ask her! ]]></string>
<string id="536593"><![CDATA[Who was it built for then?]]></string>
<string id="536594"><![CDATA[Not for you, that much is certain. At least I'd like to think so.]]></string>
<string id="536595"><![CDATA[Tell me, is your sister involved into what happened yesterday in the Stake Lot?]]></string>
<string id="536596"><![CDATA[No. But she's involved into many other things. For example, it was she who got rid of Eva. How's that for news, huh? She wanted to have you all for herself. I could tell you a lot about my sister… but I don't want to flaunt the dirty linen.]]></string>
<string id="536597"><![CDATA[Take the panacea. This is for you. ]]></string>
<string id="536598"><![CDATA[Aglaya Lilich asked me to give you this. ]]></string>
<string id="536599"><![CDATA[I do not want to have anything to do with with Aglaya Lilich. ]]></string>
<string id="536600"><![CDATA[It's a panacea. ]]></string>
<string id="536601"><![CDATA[It was she who put down the bull in the Bone Stake Lot yesterday, wasn't it?]]></string>
<string id="536603"><![CDATA[So no Kain has anything to do with what happened in the Lot?]]></string>
<string id="536605"><![CDATA[If you tell me what she is up to, perhaps I'll be able to help you.]]></string>
<string id="536606"><![CDATA[Simon. It is for his sake that father and uncle are throwing away their lives. Well, I don't believe in all that metempsychosis! And this is the only place where we can play for real. This is our childhood. We are not giving it away to anyone!]]></string>
<string id="536607"><![CDATA[And that's all? Pfft. No one would remove you from here until the disease is over.]]></string>
<string id="536608"><![CDATA[And when it is? Then what?]]></string>
<string id="536609"><![CDATA[Take the panacea. It's for you. Let us not meet ever again.]]></string>
<string id="536610"><![CDATA[How do you know about Eva? ]]></string>
<string id="536611"><![CDATA[Ask my sister. She knows how to do these things. She won't lie to you. She'll tell the truth.]]></string>
<string id="536612"><![CDATA[Eva has committed suicide and left a note.]]></string>
<string id="536613"><![CDATA[I'll tell the Inquisitor that you by any stretch of imagination cannot acknowledge the complicity of your relatives to the Lot situation—against your personal preferences. Is that correct?]]></string>
<string id="536614"><![CDATA[It is. Now no one will claim that I'm only saying that to protect my family.]]></string>
<string id="536615"><![CDATA[Yes, I have already realized what your position is.]]></string>
<string id="536616"><![CDATA[He is alive and well.]]></string>
<string id="536617"><![CDATA[Yes, of course. It was ugly. Burakh is beside himself. ]]></string>
<string id="536618"><![CDATA[Do the Kains have anything to do with it?]]></string>
<string id="536619"><![CDATA[Wait a minute... No, this can't be. The Kains were within a hair's breadth of destruction. The bull situation was arranged to smear their name and set the people against them. Who gave you this… unique idea? Because I can't believe that you've come to this conclusion on your own via logical inference.]]></string>
<string id="536620"><![CDATA[Aglaya thinks Maria did it.]]></string>
<string id="536621"><![CDATA[This is your love for her speaking.]]></string>
<string id="536622"><![CDATA[No. The nature of my love for her allows me to justify any installation of hers in any lot. Let her build everything she deems necessary! Because sooner or later Maria will construct the space for magic to return to. There's nothing more beautiful than the expectation of a miracle. ]]></string>
<string id="536623"><![CDATA[Doesn't sound very Olgimsky, to be honest.]]></string>
<string id="536624"><![CDATA[My father never loved me—so I have no desire to pursue his lifework. I will revere him as I did before, but the family business… is no more. Little sister is right. The powers switch places.]]></string>
<string id="536625"><![CDATA[I promised to give this to you. It's a panacea. ]]></string>
<string id="536626"><![CDATA[Well. Does this mean Maria had nothing to do with the yesterday's accident? ]]></string>
<string id="536627"><![CDATA[She hadn't. But even if she had—what of it? Would it have changed anything?]]></string>
<string id="536628"><![CDATA[I'll relay your words to the Inquisitor. ]]></string>
<string id="536629"><![CDATA[Why are you telling me this?]]></string>
<string id="536630"><![CDATA[My daughter had two final wishes. To talk to her mother, and to visit the other two chrysales. She can do neither now. I don't think she will ever talk to her mother again. But she must see the future Mistresses.They must acknowledge her.]]></string>
<string id="536631"><![CDATA[Is there anything I can do to help?]]></string>
<string id="536632"><![CDATA[Someone needs to take the symbols of succession from these "chrysales". They know what this is about because they can also feel this awakening. It is very much possible that Capella knows who has inherited the title of Katerina, the usurping Mistress of the Earth. She was, after all, the leader of one of the powers while we were dead.]]></string>
<string id="536633"><![CDATA[But why are you asking me?]]></string>
<string id="536634"><![CDATA[Maria did. She specifically pointed out that she didn't want a stranger's hand to touch the rings that will forever adorn her body.]]></string>
<string id="536635"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="536636"><![CDATA[Oh how ferocious Mother Nature is! For 'tis her wrath that has to be withstood… Oh friend, if only I could wet my whistle… I'd gladly give you anything on earth in exchange for a gulp of chilly spring water!]]></string>
<string id="536638"><![CDATA[How about we barter? You'll have your water and I'll have bandages.]]></string>
<string id="536639"><![CDATA[Do you need a drink, you poor soul? How about some water?]]></string>
<string id="536640"><![CDATA[You want to barter? We are a poor lot, but we'd fork out something for a good man, a kind man, a big-hearted man… like a fork! Yeah! A fork!]]></string>
<string id="536641"><![CDATA[Here you go then.]]></string>
<string id="536642"><![CDATA[Do you have bandages—or something else that one can dress wounds with? Give them to me. They're of no use to you anyway.]]></string>
<string id="536643"><![CDATA[I'll give all my water to you! And you… can you give me something to stop the bleeding? I'm injured, you see…]]></string>
<string id="536644"><![CDATA[Now we barter, drifter man. I brought you some water. ]]></string>
<string id="536645"><![CDATA[Why don't you drink from the river then?]]></string>
<string id="536646"><![CDATA[Only lowly animals, dirty of image, drink from the river. Us proud men deserve to drink spring water... 'Tis brought here in barrels, but they're often empty. I'd get it from there, but I'm out of bottles; I'd drink straight out of a fountain, but I'm gonna faint... the air here's too spicy. I'm barely walking as it is.]]></string>
<string id="536647"><![CDATA[So the local herbs are in bloom this time of year?]]></string>
<string id="536648"><![CDATA[They're not blooming, professor, they're withering… Withering and thence producing general langour. People fall dead without sleep like leaves from a branch… All because of the surplus of juices. Or maybe not—I'm not really a science guy…]]></string>
<string id="536649"><![CDATA[So you're a student? ]]></string>
<string id="536650"><![CDATA[Oh no, I'm but a woeful wretch, professor… A wretch that had suffered all too much.]]></string>
<string id="536651"><![CDATA[My condolences.]]></string>
<string id="536652"><![CDATA[Why don't you shut up then?]]></string>
<string id="536653"><![CDATA[So you've got an Abattoir in the town? What is it?]]></string>
<string id="536654"><![CDATA[It is with great trepidation that I set about to answer your question, professor. The Abattoir has been here since nothing else was. And mark my word—here it will remain when nothing else does. For 'tis all vanity of vanities, and all is vanity. ]]></string>
<string id="536655"><![CDATA[Do switch your silver tongue for a tongue more common, kind sir.]]></string>
<string id="536656"><![CDATA[Hundreds of bulls are being slaughtered there—what else is there to know? It is our humble town that provides the whole Northeastern Region with beef! Or even the whole country, mayhap. How many poor bull souls does it take to stuff the belly of a country that has millions upon millions of citizens? Eh?]]></string>
<string id="536657"><![CDATA[Your humble river obviously also supplies the whole country with water…]]></string>
<string id="536658"><![CDATA[A lot. ]]></string>
<string id="536659"><![CDATA[Why trepidate?]]></string>
<string id="536660"><![CDATA[My trepidation comes from uncertainty and confusion, professor. The Abattoir instills fear, for what is it if not a temple of death? An operational one, mind you, unlike the town Cathedral on Bridge Square…]]></string>
<string id="536661"><![CDATA[Operational?]]></string>
<string id="536662"><![CDATA[You are a lowly animal. Dirty of image, too. Drink from the river.]]></string>
<string id="536663"><![CDATA[You are a suspicious crowd… Your mugs scream of penal labour! Each of you is a murderer-to-be! What, am I wrong?]]></string>
<string id="536664"><![CDATA[So what? Did you find out whose guise the shabnak assumed yesterday?]]></string>
<string id="536665"><![CDATA[What? Who are you calling a shabnak?]]></string>
<string id="536666"><![CDATA[It's not a "who". It's a "what". A living myth. The Steppe people believe that a shabnak is not human at all, but rather a wandering soul; a state of evil—and 'tis among us that it walks. Bottoms up, buddy! Have a drink! That'll clear your head up.]]></string>
<string id="536667"><![CDATA[I am absolutely amazed that you people can believe in things like this while simultaneously having the capability to use a railroad.]]></string>
<string id="536668"><![CDATA['N what is wrong with that, eh? Life is a complicated matter, it can't be catalogued. You think we're all savages here, making a fuss about a fairytale?]]></string>
<string id="536669"><![CDATA[Hardly.]]></string>
<string id="536670"><![CDATA[We're breathing Steppe here. Oh, the vapours that evaporate from it! The Steppe is wiser—no railroad can conceal it. Eh, the necromancers shouldn't have pinned their hopes on you. It requires a knack rather than intelligence… You don't believe in the shabnak—and it has just passed you by.]]></string>
<string id="536671"><![CDATA[I'll find my way around it somehow.]]></string>
<string id="536672"><![CDATA[Yes, the air here is unhealthy. My eyes are about to burst from the fragrance. ]]></string>
<string id="536673"><![CDATA[This is exactly what I think, yes.]]></string>
<string id="536674"><![CDATA[Thank you, but I'll pass.]]></string>
<string id="536675"><![CDATA[I didn't. Tell me, what do they store in the local warehouses?]]></string>
<string id="536676"><![CDATA[The mortal remains of the late animals are in the southern part, as well as hide and ground bones. Jerked meat, cured meat, smoked meat, canned meat—all storaged and ready to go. The southern part of the Warehouses is a giant bull mortuary. So it is!]]></string>
<string id="536677"><![CDATA[And what about the northern part? ]]></string>
<string id="536678"><![CDATA[The nothern part is house to consumable junk. The regular train comes regularly, as is evident by the name, bringing fancy goods to our neck of the woods. Pants and snaps, chemicals and perfume, all them thingamajigs… 'Tis essentially another mortuary, for everyday life is the killer of spirit... ]]></string>
<string id="536679"><![CDATA[Aren't you a philosopher! ]]></string>
<string id="536680"><![CDATA[A woesome rag I am; I'm walking ashes; a freak devoid of grace. As are we all… Do not take yourself too seriously, and you will learn the truth. Bottoms up, brother! The grass is wiser than we are!]]></string>
<string id="536681"><![CDATA[As for you, do try to just take yourself for granted, kind sir. Stop being so hard on yourself.]]></string>
<string id="536682"><![CDATA[Yes, the picture you've painted is spot-on.]]></string>
<string id="536683"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>

<string id="536685"><![CDATA[Well? What's the news around the town?]]></string>
<string id="536686"><![CDATA[Vanity of vanities! All is vanity! Take the Polyhedron, that's become a children's game now... 'Tis lovely children that reside there now; they've weaved a nest among the deadly tines of the machine—like charming singing birds… But not for them the Tower's been conceived, but for the glory of the benefactors. The family of them philantropists!]]></string>
<string id="536687"><![CDATA[What family are you talking about? ]]></string>
<string id="536688"><![CDATA[The Kains, stricken down with bitter grief these days… who else? For 'twas another purpose that their project was intended for… The purpose without notice having lost, it stands abandoned now. And so it will until the end of days.]]></string>
<string id="536689"><![CDATA[What was it intended for?]]></string>
<string id="536690"><![CDATA[Damned if I know… not for the mortal life, that's filled with honest sweat, with mundane pain, and transient jealousy. There was a lofty purpose that is unknown to me. A purpose unfulfilled. A dream! Yessir!]]></string>
<string id="536691"><![CDATA[Pah! Words, words, words… you're just saying words—while having absolutely no idea what you're talking about.]]></string>
<string id="536692"><![CDATA[Okay. Tell me, is any of your mates sick with a strange disease?]]></string>
<string id="536693"><![CDATA[Our souls are sick... Mine, and those of my friends. A sickness both contagious and lethal… the sickness unto death.]]></string>

<string id="536696"><![CDATA[Isn't there? If not today or tomorrow, it surely will come… someday. I'm planning to drag my miserable existence for at least forty more years here. ]]></string>

<string id="536700"><![CDATA['Tis in the Knots, which would be the middle part of the Town of Men. The Spleen flanks the Station from northwest, stretching along the tributary; and the tributary's called the Guzzle. All them spleens and guzzling are quite intricate, ain't they? Heh heh…]]></string>
<string id="536701"><![CDATA[That's fine. I'm good at anatomy. I'm a trained specialist, after all.]]></string>

<string id="536711"><![CDATA[Aye, twyrine sap it is… And let me tell you, the twyre gathered at the Flabby Mud last year had extraordinary properties, truly extraordinary!]]></string>
<string id="536712"><![CDATA[Really? What were they?]]></string>
<string id="536713"><![CDATA[Here's what I think. A herb is like a person—each blade has its own character. The bouquet has to be collected carefully, like a family, bloom to bloom—and the proportion, mind the proportion!—but water is also important. You can't just take any water.]]></string>
<string id="536714"><![CDATA[Yes! Tell me about the water, my good man. What kind of water do you have here? ]]></string>
<string id="536715"><![CDATA[We all live off Steppe juices. Twyre the herb draws its juices from the Steppe; sun draws its juices from twyre; so does a bull, who gives and takes away—so does a man, a sinful worm, who sucks the earth out for his needs. The juices of a body are a gift—and the key to understanding everything!]]></string>
<string id="536716"><![CDATA[Where do you draw water from? ]]></string>
<string id="536717"><![CDATA[The Steppe grants us water. Each spring has a different kind: one of them is filling, another's joyful, and the third one may be evil…]]></string>
<string id="536718"><![CDATA[Evil? How?]]></string>
<string id="536719"><![CDATA['Tis no good drinking the Sugagh water, professor. Whenever anyone offers you a glass of water, take the lovely dove shritfront and inquire as to whether the water's been taken from Sugagh. And if they confess that it has, stuff that water down their throat, for 'tis a sin to blight an honest man with it. Evil comes from that water. Not the pest, just... evil.]]></string>

<string id="536723"><![CDATA[What kind of evil? ]]></string>
<string id="536724"><![CDATA[Bad fortune, here's what kind. Whoever drinks that water, dies not their own death. That's a reliable omen, I'm telling you. Beware of that water, doctor.

<string id="536731"><![CDATA['Tis adjoined to the middle of the Knots from northwest. In simpler words 'tis the western edge of the middle cape. The Shelter, the Ravels' mansion, is there. Why d'ya ask?]]></string>
<string id="536732"><![CDATA[Who are the Ravels? ]]></string>
<string id="536733"><![CDATA[A shady family. There used to be a captain Ravel here—the only military man in the entire town, but he was worth a battalion, if you ask me. He snapped a bull with his bare hands once. Used to hit nine bottles out of eight from fifty steps away. A tough man he was...]]></string>
<string id="536734"><![CDATA[Did he die?]]></string>
<string id="536735"><![CDATA[Killed in the war, or so they say… In the war, but not in the field. There are rumours aplenty. And now his daughter Lara, a xenial and cordial orphan, lives in The Shelter. An angelic lady, pure and worthy of most sincere compassion!]]></string>
<string id="536736"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="536737"><![CDATA[Why did you call the Ravels shady then?]]></string>
<string id="536738"><![CDATA[For I am rotten! 'Tis all my foul tongue striving to tittle and tattle. But your reproach is just, professor, and so I will be keeping mum from now on. Not a single vicious word shall escape my lips. And as for the departed, 'tis all nonsense!]]></string>
<string id="536739"><![CDATA[What departed?]]></string>
<string id="536740"><![CDATA[What departed? I never said a word about departed people! No one departs anything. 'Tis all baby talk and superstition. And now I have to take my leave, professor. Here's your hat, so to speak, and what's your hurry? Goodbye and good riddance.]]></string>

<string id="536752"><![CDATA[I've heard about Artemy Burakh. Is he a ripper though? Nay, professor... He's a haruspex. He belongs to the respected Burakh family. It's not the same as cutting mongrels, it means something. Although if you really need a mongrel cut…]]></string>
<string id="536753"><![CDATA[Do you know where he can be found?]]></string>
<string id="536754"><![CDATA[He settled down at the Works, on the outskirts of the town. Either in the boiler-house or in the power-house… That's where he is, kind sir. But I would like to add, if I may, that he belongs not to a rough cellar, but rather to a halfpace.]]></string>
<string id="536755"><![CDATA[What halfpace?]]></string>
<string id="536756"><![CDATA[I knew his father, professor. He was a most worthy man. It is due to Isidor's good will that Foreman Oyun rather than the Haruspex is the current leader of the Kin and the taskmaster of the Abattoir.

<string id="536795"><![CDATA[What else could it be? What else is causing them fevers? The dire beast called microbe. Shaggy in image, fangy in jaws, scary in manner. Smallish in size though, which is a relief. Has a knack for reproduction. Am I right, professor?]]></string>

<string id="536902"><![CDATA[Caches! The Mild Dew's been looted! Cuckoo said someone's pillaged his cache too. But the worst thing is that Silly House has also been sacked clean. Who can tell now which shmowders are good and which are Catchfly's? If you eat the latter, you're toast—you can just as well wash them down with acid!]]></string>
<string id="536903"><![CDATA[Sounds horrible... ]]></string>
<string id="536904"><![CDATA[Is everything all right with you, you little rapscallion? ]]></string>
<string id="536905"><![CDATA[A neighbour of ours has been killed by patrolmen! I still can't wrap my head around it... That means they can make away with me just as easily. And with you too…]]></string>
<string id="536906"><![CDATA[What did they kill him for?]]></string>
<string id="536907"><![CDATA[Well... They say he attacked someone too. He did have quite a temper, but they beat him to death with their mega fists! By the way, was there really an order to do that? For reals? How do we fight now, how do we defend our honour?]]></string>
<string id="536908"><![CDATA[The order was issued to put a stop to the chaos.]]></string>
<string id="536909"><![CDATA[Pfft... Right... Good luck with that! You keep in mind that we can stand up for ourselves just fine! If anyone hurts me, my Dina, or any of my friends, or Capella—they will be in big big trouble! My fists are in the right place too, ya know! Got it?]]></string>
<string id="536910"><![CDATA[Why are you shouting at me? Do I look like a patrolman?]]></string>
<string id="536911"><![CDATA[Just don't go running rampant too soon.]]></string>
<string id="536912"><![CDATA[You people should stay indoors to protect yourself from the epidemiological hazard, not go around fighting!]]></string>

<string id="536914"><![CDATA[Close your mouth, you'll eat a fly.]]></string>

<string id="536917"><![CDATA[Tell me, are you a doctor? ]]></string>
<string id="536918"><![CDATA[Well... Yes.]]></string>
<string id="536919"><![CDATA[So you have a bandage? A tourniquet, any bandaging material? ]]></string>
<string id="536920"><![CDATA[What do you need it for?]]></string>
<string id="536921"><![CDATA[Huh! "What for"! How is that even a question? What do you think is the most useful thing in a fight? What if you're bleeding or your joint's been dislocated? How do you fight a war without bandages? And they're nowhere to be found…]]></string>
<string id="536922"><![CDATA[Come on, we've been there before... Stop this inane war of yours! Go home and stay in until aid arrives!]]></string>
<string id="536923"><![CDATA[Until aid arrives? When would that be? And what are we supposed to eat? Huh? There's no bread in the town—and now there's no water too… "Stay in," he says… You must be eating healthy and nutritious food, ain't you? Got yourself some nice chow, don't you, sir Bachelor, sir?]]></string>
<string id="536924"><![CDATA[You moron.]]></string>
<string id="536925"><![CDATA[It will arrive soon. Have patience. ]]></string>
<string id="536926"><![CDATA[And why are they nowhere to be found?]]></string>
<string id="536927"><![CDATA[Olgimsky, the leech, has collected all the medicine in the town and is now partly distributing it among those who are in need… And the tourniquets go to the patrolmen.]]></string>
<string id="536928"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="536929"><![CDATA[No. Bandages I have none.]]></string>

<string id="536931"><![CDATA[Where do you think you're going?]]></string>
<string id="536932"><![CDATA[Fuck it! The town is a motherfucking mess! Grab your knives, everyone! I'm done! Seems like the old taboos are as good as gone. Well, ciao, motherfuckers! Every man for himself now.]]></string>
<string id="536933"><![CDATA[What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="536934"><![CDATA[What, are you blind? Going outside is like diving into flame now. You're lucky if you can hold for three minutes, from one door to another.]]></string>
<string id="536935"><![CDATA[If you start stabbing people, there'll be no mercy for you. I mean you as a community.]]></string>

<string id="536941"><![CDATA[...]]></string>
<string id="536942"><![CDATA[Cut it with the strong language immediately! You little prick!]]></string>
<string id="536943"><![CDATA[What's the news, lad? ]]></string>
<string id="536944"><![CDATA[It's definitely a good thing that the children are holed up in the Tower. Is it true that there have been no fatal outcomes there?]]></string>
<string id="536945"><![CDATA[I don't know. I haven't been there. ]]></string>
<string id="536946"><![CDATA[I'm afraid it may collapse under the weight though. So many people have never gathered there at the same time... ]]></string>
<string id="536947"><![CDATA[And how many did? ]]></string>
<string id="536948"><![CDATA[Well... A hundred, a hundred and fifty maybe... But there's never been more than a thousand.]]></string>
<string id="536949"><![CDATA[Is that so! That means I've got one more pain in the neck now—the construcrion sheltering a thousand children may collapse any minute. Damn it to bloody hell!]]></string>
<string id="536950"><![CDATA[Oh, it's not like that… Don't you worry… It must have been designed to hold them, probably… And there actually was that time when a ton of people got in there—there was a festival. I was six then. We celebrated for three days and it went fine…]]></string>
<string id="536951"><![CDATA[Who constructed it?]]></string>
<string id="536952"><![CDATA[That I do not know. It was already there when I was born.]]></string>
<string id="536953"><![CDATA[How old are you? ]]></string>
<string id="536954"><![CDATA[Eleven. Almost twelve. ]]></string>
<string id="536955"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="536956"><![CDATA[All right... let us hope the Tower manages.]]></string>
<string id="536957"><![CDATA[I wonder why I hasn't been informed about this.]]></string>
<string id="536958"><![CDATA[Me too! I wonder why you haven't?]]></string>
<string id="536959"><![CDATA[That attitude will get you into trouble.]]></string>
<string id="536960"><![CDATA[So they say.]]></string>
<string id="536961"><![CDATA[What do you have there? ]]></string>
<string id="536962"><![CDATA[I've saved up so many nuts... But who's going to play them now? ]]></string>
<string id="536963"><![CDATA[Will you finally tell me how you play nuts? ]]></string>
<string id="536964"><![CDATA[Oh! It's a whole separate life. Each nut has a name, an age and, most importantly, experience. But not just any experience! We believe that the more adventures a nut experiences—while staying alive, of course—the more precious it becomes.]]></string>
<string id="536965"><![CDATA[Adventures? ]]></string>
<string id="536966"><![CDATA[Ha ha! Together with the owner, of course! A nut must drown in water, burn in fire, lie under a train, rob the Dogheads, get wet in a cellar, pay a visit to the Abattoir—and so on... But these games pale in comparison with what you can play in the Tower, of course... ]]></string>
<string id="536967"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="536968"><![CDATA[Everything's different there. There's real magic. Visions... Continuous dreams. Even love. I've fallen in love there, can you imagine? It's an enchanted place.]]></string>
<string id="536969"><![CDATA[My condolences.]]></string>
<string id="536970"><![CDATA[Aren't you a bit too young for that?]]></string>
<string id="536971"><![CDATA[You'll find someone.]]></string>
<string id="536972"><![CDATA[There were seven of us in the gang. There are just three of us now. I wonder if it ever ends…]]></string>
<string id="536973"><![CDATA[Do you miss your friends? ]]></string>
<string id="536974"><![CDATA[No... Not really. That's weird even. I know I'm supposed to be sad, but I just feel numb inside. Like frozen.]]></string>
<string id="536975"><![CDATA[Yes, it happens. You will start to grieve after a while.]]></string>
<string id="536976"><![CDATA[It'll end very soon. ]]></string>
<string id="536977"><![CDATA[Everything ends one day.]]></string>
<string id="536978"><![CDATA[Do you like the Polyhedron? ]]></string>
<string id="536979"><![CDATA[If I ever get to the Tower, I'd love to play Reflections. ]]></string>
<string id="536980"><![CDATA[What is Reflections? ]]></string>
<string id="536981"><![CDATA[Well, there's a labyrinth. Nobody knows what its structure is like because it feels like it's a mile long. You keep walking and walking and walking and it never ends. And when you're out, it's not actually you, but rather your reflection—and you yourself go to the Otherplace.]]></string>
<string id="536982"><![CDATA[How can a labyrinth of that size fit in there? ]]></string>
<string id="536983"><![CDATA[That's the trick! Perhaps you're not walking at all—perhaps you're going around in circles or standing pat—and the reflections make the space around you feel like it's shifting. Isn't that cool? That's the magic of reflection. Those who come out act very… mysteriously.]]></string>
<string id="536984"><![CDATA[Mysteriously how?]]></string>
<string id="536985"><![CDATA[Unlike themselves. It's like it's you, but not really "you" you… They're not very talkative. That's why they say it's a reflection—its only purpose is to be there so that your parents aren't worried and all that. And the real person goes to the Utopia country. A miraculous land.]]></string>
<string id="536986"><![CDATA[Did many children go into the labyrinth? ]]></string>
<string id="536987"><![CDATA[They say many used to go in before, but then they realized what it does and got scared a bit. All in all, it's not so popular these days. But Smartypants did go in. So did Crowfoot, by the way… Most of them are with Notkin now.]]></string>
<string id="536988"><![CDATA[A curious story. ]]></string>
<string id="536989"><![CDATA[I'd go in there too.]]></string>
<string id="536990"><![CDATA[You make me jealous.]]></string>
<string id="536991"><![CDATA[Meh. You're spewing nonsense.]]></string>
<string id="536992"><![CDATA[You'll get there. ]]></string>
<string id="536993"><![CDATA[Well? What are you looking at? ]]></string>
<string id="536994"><![CDATA[Hey, Bachelor! Did you know that Burakh was looking for you? ]]></string>
<string id="536995"><![CDATA[What does he want from me? ]]></string>
<string id="536996"><![CDATA[I'm not sure. But he wants to spill rivers of blood. He was going to come to an agreement with you because he won't make it without your help... Hahaha! ]]></string>
<string id="536997"><![CDATA[Why would he spill rivers of blood? ]]></string>
<string id="536998"><![CDATA[That's how he can fulfill his purpose and become the Shepherd of Beasts. But that's just what they say. I don't know why. Perhaps he just feels like it? Are you planning to spill rivers of blood too? You're planning to raze one of the districts, aren't you?]]></string>
<string id="536999"><![CDATA[It's a lesser-evil solution.]]></string>
<string id="537000"><![CDATA[Just don't you dare touch the Polyhedron! ]]></string>
<string id="537001"><![CDATA[We'll see how it goes.]]></string>
<string id="537002"><![CDATA[Do not worry, young man. Whatever happens, the Tower will not come to harm. ]]></string>
<string id="537003"><![CDATA[I'm an artificer, not a butcher. ]]></string>
<string id="537004"><![CDATA[No, he'll have to make do without me.]]></string>
<string id="537005"><![CDATA[Let him keep looking. ]]></string>
<string id="537006"><![CDATA[Tell me about the Hindquarters. ]]></string>
<string id="537007"><![CDATA[Hey ho! The Hindquarters is a merry district! It's in Earth, above the factories, on the bank of the Gullet. That's where the ominous Willows are, a house of ill repute, and a pub called Factus Est. The Twins tend to spend their time at the latter—so staying there is dangerous for both your life and sanity!]]></string>
<string id="537008"><![CDATA[What's The Willows? ]]></string>
<string id="537009"><![CDATA[A malicious wench lives there! Name's Anna Angel. A proud potato if I've ever seen one. She used to be a famous singer and now she's dealing in spells and hexes! We'd smash her windows with stones, if not for the respect we used to have for the previous owners…]]></string>
<string id="537010"><![CDATA[Who lived there before? ]]></string>
<string id="537011"><![CDATA[A girl named Willow Mellow used to live there. And then she died! That's how it goes. No one would have thought about it twice, had she not died right after offering shelter to poor Anna Angel! Grace says that Willow was buried in a closed coffin... And that coffin was suspiciously light... Spooky, isn't it? ]]></string>
<string id="537012"><![CDATA[Are you kidding me? ]]></string>
<string id="537013"><![CDATA[Ha ha! Yeah, I so pranked you! Now excuse me, I'm in an awful hurry... We'll talk another time. ]]></string>
<string id="537014"><![CDATA[Hey! ]]></string>
<string id="537015"><![CDATA[The lack of proper education options is a grave social issue indeed... ]]></string>
<string id="537016"><![CDATA[You're a quick lad. Now off you go... ]]></string>
<string id="537017"><![CDATA[Tell me about the Polyhedron. ]]></string>
<string id="537018"><![CDATA[That's where the youngest Kain—Kaspar, styled Khan—has fortified! There are more than a thousand children up there now; almost every child in the town went to the Polyhedron—except for urchins, orphans, and bold daredevils like me! ]]></string>
<string id="537019"><![CDATA[Are you trying to tell me they live there? ]]></string>
<string id="537020"><![CDATA[Well... The older ones do. The younger kids just come by to play. But yesterday everyone who's older than three and younger than fifteen had a huge gathering there. They're hiding!]]></string>
<string id="537021"><![CDATA[From the parents? ]]></string>
<string id="537022"><![CDATA[From fate, Bachelor... From fate. Yeah!]]></string>
<string id="537023"><![CDATA[You cannot hide from fate. ]]></string>
<string id="537024"><![CDATA[Good for them.]]></string>
<string id="537025"><![CDATA[Tell me about the Crude Sprawl. ]]></string>
<string id="537026"><![CDATA[Bah! The most rottenest place ever! The soil breathes there as though it could swallow you whole. A real bog! What could you possible need in that place?]]></string>
<string id="537027"><![CDATA[How do I get there? ]]></string>
<string id="537028"><![CDATA[It's simple! When they tell you to go to hell, just choose any direction; when you've found the worst place in the world, this is it! Ha ha ha!]]></string>
<string id="537029"><![CDATA[You are a very impolite young man. Try to answer me once again, but this time be serious.]]></string>
<string id="537030"><![CDATA[Oh... There's something very alarming in your eyes… I apologize profusely! It's in Earth. The southernmost eastern district that borders the Abattoir. Its other end is adjoined to the Cemetery! Rawrrr!]]></string>
<string id="537031"><![CDATA[Thanks. ]]></string>
<string id="537032"><![CDATA[Do be more polite from now on.]]></string>
<string id="537033"><![CDATA[How about a smack on the head?]]></string>
<string id="537034"><![CDATA[Nothing. I'm just curious.]]></string>
<string id="537035"><![CDATA[Tell about the Tanners district.]]></string>
<string id="537036"><![CDATA[A menacing place! It's the northwest cape of Earth, the backside of the town. That's where The Rod, the Saburovs' mansion, is. We don't play there. Alexander is not to be trifled with. You never know when his strict gaze turns towards you…]]></string>
<string id="537037"><![CDATA[What's so bad about it?]]></string>
<string id="537038"><![CDATA[Well, who knows… No, don't ever mess with the Saburovs. Then again, the wife—Katerina—is not only a witch, but also a Mistress. I was too young to see any of the old Mistresses. Katerina was the last one… Although I've never seen her either.]]></string>
<string id="537039"><![CDATA[Stop—stop with the chattering! Slower, please! What are the Mistresses? ]]></string>
<string id="537040"><![CDATA[Rumour has it they're like goddesses. A Mistress is the Mother of All. They knew how to control time, focus power, create an Outburst, and tell the future. Among other things. Like I said, Mothers of All.]]></string>
<string id="537041"><![CDATA[I see. ]]></string>
<string id="537042"><![CDATA[Shush, why you are shaking? I'm not making you go there.]]></string>
<string id="537043"><![CDATA[Thanks. ]]></string>
<string id="537044"><![CDATA[Tell me about the Skinners district. ]]></string>
<string id="537045"><![CDATA[What is there to tell? It's just a district… in Earth. The nothernmost of the western districts, it's further to the north than the Termitary. Ah! Actually, a good friend of mine, Sticky, lives there! Sticky the Nuthatch! Do you know what a nuthatch is? It's a very sly snake!]]></string>
<string id="537046"><![CDATA[And where does Sticky live? ]]></string>
<string id="537047"><![CDATA[Well... In a house on the bank of the river Gorkhon. It's actually tricky to find… When you're there, just ask someone, they'll show you.]]></string>
<string id="537048"><![CDATA[I will.]]></string>
<string id="537049"><![CDATA[Actually a nuthatch is a bird. All right, thanks for the help. ]]></string>
<string id="537050"><![CDATA[Like I would want to rub shoulders with the likes of you... ]]></string>
<string id="537051"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="537052"><![CDATA[I'm sick, I'm in agony… My head seems to be filled with lead… my insides burn. Could you please donate a couple coins for me to cure myself and my family? I'll repay you… I'll spread the word of your untold magnanimity…]]></string>
<string id="537053"><![CDATA[Take it. I hope you use it wisely.]]></string>
<string id="537054"><![CDATA[How much is there? ]]></string>
<string id="537055"><![CDATA[A hundred is enough for you.]]></string>
<string id="537056"><![CDATA[Five hundred. ]]></string>
<string id="537057"><![CDATA[One thousand. ]]></string>
<string id="537058"><![CDATA[Two thousand. ]]></string>
<string id="537059"><![CDATA[Three thousand. ]]></string>
<string id="537060"><![CDATA[Four thousand. Remember, it's intended for all of you!]]></string>
<string id="537061"><![CDATA[What do you care? I can also give nothing. ]]></string>
<string id="537062"><![CDATA[Are you unwell?]]></string>
<string id="537063"><![CDATA[I think I have a fever… My brain is on fire and my heart's also kinda… But it will pass… It will…]]></string>
<string id="537064"><![CDATA[Do go straight home. Your condition demands you lie down.]]></string>
<string id="537065"><![CDATA[What can you tell me about the local cemetery?]]></string>
<string id="537066"><![CDATA[The Cemetery? Why do you ask?]]></string>
<string id="537067"><![CDATA[The call of duty.]]></string>
<string id="537068"><![CDATA[Then it may be of interest to you that the local burial culture is extremely primitive… The late caretaker of the Cemetery was a local too. He encouraged the backwards practices of illiterate herdsmen. The dead are still being buried carelessly!]]></string>
<string id="537069"><![CDATA[Carelessly? What do you mean by that?]]></string>
<string id="537070"><![CDATA[The bodies aren't always interred. The locals believe the Earth to be their foremother. Only a select few get buried into the ground; the rest have to do without. Some are buried deeper while others lie much closer to the surface.]]></string>
<string id="537071"><![CDATA[What do they do to the bodies that are not interred?]]></string>
<string id="537072"><![CDATA[The Kin doesn't show anyone what they do to their dead. I never belonged to the Kin anyway. The Termitary is perforated with holes—they drag the body inside, and in a day they pull out a leather parcel and pay their respects to the dead.]]></string>
<string id="537073"><![CDATA[Don't the local authorities care at all?]]></string>
<string id="537074"><![CDATA[The Kin governs itself. Big Vlad doesn't bother them as long as they keep generating profit. They're on their own… so what? They break no laws—so they're allowed to do whatever they want at home. They are a constitution unto themselves. They follow their ancestors' rites.]]></string>
<string id="537075"><![CDATA[This is utterly barbaric.]]></string>
<string id="537076"><![CDATA[Ew... disgusting! ]]></string>
<string id="537077"><![CDATA[Do all townspeople do that?]]></string>
<string id="537078"><![CDATA[No, of course not. The civilized people bury their dead properly. But prejudice and superstition are very much alive—and the higher-ups encourage them! What is there to say if such people are in charge of the Cemetery? God knows what they do at night when no one's looking.]]></string>
<string id="537079"><![CDATA[I've ended up in a real hellhole, it seems…]]></string>
<string id="537080"><![CDATA[What was the caretaker of the cemetery like? ]]></string>
<string id="537081"><![CDATA[I've never talked to him... His daughter is in charge of the job now. She also adheres to the old traditions completely, following her father's teachings. She feeds the dead…]]></string>
<string id="537082"><![CDATA[Feeds them? With what?]]></string>
<string id="537083"><![CDATA[Bread and broth. She also pours fresh milk into the graves.]]></string>
<string id="537084"><![CDATA[Ah, okay, obviously…]]></string>
<string id="537085"><![CDATA[You look like you may very well relocate there soon.]]></string>
<string id="537086"><![CDATA[Very funny... Yes, very much so... Is this an outsider's joke or a doctor's diagnosis?]]></string>
<string id="537087"><![CDATA[A joke. ]]></string>
<string id="537088"><![CDATA[A diagnosis. ]]></string>
<string id="537089"><![CDATA[What do you need money for, old man? ]]></string>
<string id="537090"><![CDATA[One has to stockpile necessities! I think I'll spend the rest of the day shopping. The prices seem to be rising for some reason… That means people are worried. Or are those the profiteers' shenanigans? Huh? What do you think?]]></string>
<string id="537091"><![CDATA[What does it have to do with profiteers?]]></string>
<string id="537092"><![CDATA[Think for yourself. There are little to no eatables and other essential goods left in the town. Everyone's waiting for the regular train to arrive.]]></string>
<string id="537093"><![CDATA[The town based on slaughterhouses has no eatables? Are you joking?]]></string>
<string id="537094"><![CDATA[We cannot eat the meat of our bulls! We're not supposed to… They'd disapprove of us. They're very straightforward, you know. Like children.]]></string>
<string id="537095"><![CDATA[When famine starts, you'll sing a different song.]]></string>
<string id="537096"><![CDATA[I don't think there's going to be a famine… still, our reserves are gradually getting depleted. There are lines at every food store. A loaf of rye bread costs fifty! Seems like the ruler's death and the rumours of a maneater have disturbed everyone greatly.]]></string>
<string id="537097"><![CDATA[Everything happens.]]></string>
<string id="537098"><![CDATA[Yes, it's an ordinary panic.]]></string>
<string id="537099"><![CDATA[Who is "like children"? Bulls? Is that your parenting policy, huh…?]]></string>
<string id="537100"><![CDATA[What is the general food situation in the town? ]]></string>
<string id="537101"><![CDATA[Oh, don't even ask… We've been waiting for a train for three weeks now. We're used to it coming like clockwork every month; the shops aren't used to stocking on perishables. And household reserves are at an end… All anyone can talk about these days is famine.]]></string>
<string id="537102"><![CDATA[Really? I doubt there is a famine threat. Doesn't the town have a decent supply of edibles storaged somewhere?]]></string>
<string id="537103"><![CDATA[I do not think about it at all.]]></string>

<string id="537108"><![CDATA[So there is. And?]]></string>
<string id="537109"><![CDATA[Anyone can die... Any second anyone can get infected by anything… No one is safe… I'd rather it was shabnak-adyr the maneater raging!]]></string>

<string id="537111"><![CDATA[Will everyone who gets infected die? ]]></string>
<string id="537112"><![CDATA[Everyone who asks moronic questions will, that's for sure.]]></string>

<string id="537118"><![CDATA[I have no plans to.]]></string>
<string id="537119"><![CDATA[But isn't that the reason why you've been sent here?]]></string>
<string id="537120"><![CDATA[I have not been sent here, old man! I came on my own volition. As a private person. ]]></string>
<string id="537121"><![CDATA[You can say so. Retrospectively… those bastards.]]></string>
<string id="537122"><![CDATA[I'll try. ]]></string>
<string id="537123"><![CDATA[Easy, easy there... Nothing will. You will all die. ]]></string>
<string id="537124"><![CDATA[You should have a rest. You're exhausted. The air here is detrimental to your health.]]></string>
<string id="537125"><![CDATA[Yes, that's just how this place is… Every breath threatens death… It's like walking through crossfire… or a simple fire. But what can you do? We have to…]]></string>
<string id="537126"><![CDATA[You "have to"? Would you be so kind as to explain to me what emergency is forcing you outside?]]></string>
<string id="537127"><![CDATA[We're looking for food... We're hungry! We need to check on our relatives... to see how they're doing! Secondly, staying in is even more terrifying. It feels safer outside. What if that thing engulfs the house like it did five years ago? It tended to just appear inside the room back then... by itself.]]></string>
<string id="537128"><![CDATA[I said, stop scurrying! Away with the unnecessary fuss!]]></string>
<string id="537129"><![CDATA[Nonsense. Things do not appear "by themselves". ]]></string>
<string id="537130"><![CDATA[That's why you are continuously being told to stay in! Wait for the Executors to come to you!]]></string>

<string id="537132"><![CDATA[Not only do you increase the risk of getting infected, but you're also spreading the disease! I should have you all shot.]]></string>
<string id="537133"><![CDATA[But for some reason it only makes pinpoint attacks… Some houses perish from the pest, while others remain unscathed. They seem to be in the clear; in my opinion, that means they're free to walk through.]]></string>

<string id="537135"><![CDATA[It's your own fault if you get infected then. And the patrolmen will keep you carriers from entering other districts.]]></string>

<string id="537143"><![CDATA[No. But my soul does... Why is Mother Earth so angry with us? Who's been tormenting her? What did we do wrong, professor? Did we gather too much twyre? No, the Kin's been doing it since ancient times… and it was fine.]]></string>
<string id="537144"><![CDATA[What does earth have to do with it?]]></string>
<string id="537145"><![CDATA[It's simple. The locals respect the Earth, even though we are no farmers, but rather herdsmen... They also say the sun evaporates these miasmas into the air, so the air is bad around here. So who knows where the pest comes from...?]]></string>
<string id="537146"><![CDATA[It's not your job to think about it.]]></string>
<string id="537147"><![CDATA[Yes, you're right. It's all the sun's fault.]]></string>
<string id="537148"><![CDATA[Wasn't medicine distributed to you?]]></string>
<string id="537149"><![CDATA[We have been given some, but they say this medicine doesn't work in small dosages—and big dosages lead to poisoning and even death.]]></string>
<string id="537150"><![CDATA[Who says that?]]></string>
<string id="537151"><![CDATA[People do... They say one has to swallow up twenty neomycinum pills to stop the infection. They're being tested today—various pills, that is—and volunteers are encouraged... They say if the testing is successful, they'll start handing the stuff out.]]></string>
<string id="537152"><![CDATA[Perhaps... And who did you say was in charge of this?]]></string>
<string id="537153"><![CDATA[They say the Olgimskys have snatched control of it. They'll be the ones to profit from our torment now.]]></string>

<string id="537158"><![CDATA[It's too crowded here. People burden the earth. It's time to cull the population… The Earth requires way less people than what we have. Otherwise there'll be calamity after calamity.]]></string>
<string id="537159"><![CDATA[Oh really?]]></string>
<string id="537160"><![CDATA[Yes! Earth is depressed under the burden of humankind. Its crust is way more delicate than it seems; it gives in under our weight. And then murderous spirits pop out from the underworld.]]></string>
<string id="537161"><![CDATA[Are you sure murderous spirits live underground?]]></string>
<string id="537162"><![CDATA[Well, that was me allegorizing... But the people of old claimed that the underworld is, well, underground. That's because they were afraid of what hides there. Worms. Heat. Caves. The dead... Even if the murderous spirits do not live there, it's still a bad place…]]></string>
<string id="537163"><![CDATA[Well, that's probably true.]]></string>
<string id="537164"><![CDATA[There are precious minerals and resources down below too.]]></string>
<string id="537165"><![CDATA[This line of thinking would make sense for a child or an uneducated Steppe savage.]]></string>
<string id="537166"><![CDATA[Eh... Within each of us there is a place where either a scared child or a wild barbarian hides. Whenever pressure gets too high, they start bawling... He he...]]></string>
<string id="537167"><![CDATA[I don't know about you, but there's no one bawling inside of me.]]></string>
<string id="537168"><![CDATA[That is because the pressure you're under is manageable…]]></string>
<string id="537169"><![CDATA[That is not for you to judge.]]></string>
<string id="537170"><![CDATA[Yes, the demographic crisis is poignantly evident in this desert. The population density here is one person per five square kilometers!]]></string>
<string id="537171"><![CDATA[Yes, but they're gathered together, the people are all gathered in one place, and they're standing on the most sore spot of the earth, pressing upon a swollen ulcer...

<string id="537172"><![CDATA[Directional pressure, right?]]></string>
<string id="537173"><![CDATA[You think the earth feels pain because of this?]]></string>

<string id="537178"><![CDATA[But there are no other feasible lines of thinking... It's obvious, isn't it? Only a blind person would claim this plague to be anything but the punishing hand of fate. It has no natural causes. The human mind is unable to comprehend its spreading process.]]></string>

<string id="537180"><![CDATA[I don't think it's doable. Everything I see around me has an undertone of absurdity. This illness cannot be defeated—and therefore it cannot be explained.

<string id="537189"><![CDATA[You're describing schizophrenia. ]]></string>
<string id="537190"><![CDATA[Right, exactly. Insanity, absurdity, hallucinations. The whole world is feeling feverish. And the war cannot come to an end, too; the frontline is about to crumble, and then the enemy armies will rush to our southern lands... ]]></string>

<string id="537200"><![CDATA[Why do you ask? ]]></string>
<string id="537201"><![CDATA[The carrier or the source of the infection could be there.]]></string>
<string id="537202"><![CDATA[Oooh! I thought so—surely someone must be be picking the plague up by the handful somewhere. They throw it around then, and here you go—an outbreak. And then it dies out. Then the next day someone throws more bad stuff around… Sounds plausible… But who can it be? Perhaps the Executors with their masks and their cloaks?]]></string>
<string id="537203"><![CDATA[I was asking about a place. ]]></string>
<string id="537204"><![CDATA[Perhaps it's the infected food from the Warehouses. Or maybe rats? What if something died beneath the ground? Rats gnaw on carrion, tear it to slices—and then they slip into the houses... And there you have it. You should talk to Saburov about that. He's supposed to be in charge of the cellars.]]></string>

<string id="537280"><![CDATA[It's just a catchy name. Notkin says it's because each of them has a familiar—a cat, a dog, a crow, or a grass-snake. Half-a-soul more than a normal person. Or a normal animal…]]></string>

<string id="537319"><![CDATA[Come on, you can't miss it. Missing this mostrosity would be an achievement in and of itself! Here's how you go—to the east, then turn once, turn the second time, then go south. It's right there, past the Crude Sprawl and the Skinners.]]></string>
<string id="537320"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="537321"><![CDATA[And the Crude Sprawl and the Skinners are…?]]></string>
<string id="537322"><![CDATA[There they are, in Earth! Gee, you're completely clueless, aren't you? Let's see. Here you are, facing the river, right? The Guzzle's to the left, the Gullet's to the right. The area between them is called the Knots. The Stone Yard is to the right from the Guzzle. Earth is to the right of the Gullet. Got it now?]]></string>
<string id="537323"><![CDATA[I got it, darling.]]></string>
<string id="537324"><![CDATA[No... I didn't.]]></string>
<string id="537325"><![CDATA[Ah, you're impossible…!]]></string>
<string id="537326"><![CDATA[Well...]]></string>
<string id="537328"><![CDATA[Don't worry, you'll get another chance to mourn the boys yet.]]></string>
<string id="537329"><![CDATA[Easy there! Where are you running so fast?]]></string>
<string id="537330"><![CDATA[Shopping! Everything's getting so pricy… The prices are rising by leaps and bounds! Literally by the hour, and I mean it! An hour ago butter cost a hundred, and now it's five hundred! I can't even imagine what it'll be like by the evening. What am I supposed to tell Mom?]]></string>
<string id="537331"><![CDATA[Why is this happening?]]></string>
<string id="537332"><![CDATA[People say it's because the train will not come, and because there's something stirring...]]></string>
<string id="537333"><![CDATA[What train?]]></string>
<string id="537334"><![CDATA[The train train! The one that transports food into the town. We have nothing stored at home, not even flour. You know how much I love stickjaw? And candy boxes, you know, the ones with green, yellow, and orange sweets all mixed up. But I've gobbled up the last one I had a week ago...]]></string>
<string id="537335"><![CDATA[That is indeed a sobering tragedy.]]></string>
<string id="537336"><![CDATA[So did you buy a lot?]]></string>
<string id="537337"><![CDATA[Nothing at all... we don't have that kind of money. Do you know how much they ask for a loaf of bread in the Spleen? Three thousand! You could buy a horse for that! I thought for a bit that I was going bonkers… ]]></string>
<string id="537338"><![CDATA[So this is what sheer panic looks like…]]></string>
<string id="537339"><![CDATA[What? ]]></string>
<string id="537340"><![CDATA[Never mind.]]></string>
<string id="537341"><![CDATA[Are you afraid your mother's going to scold you?]]></string>
<string id="537342"><![CDATA[Mom sent us all out shopping. Told us to look all over the Town and buy everything we can. Obviously, first and foremost it's sugar, salt, flour, bread, fish... Oh, oops! No fish, no, and no meat. What else? I forgot...!]]></string>
<string id="537343"><![CDATA[I would also recommend buying vitamins and antibiotics. Do you have a drugstore around here?]]></string>
<string id="537344"><![CDATA[There's one in the Atrium, two more by the Theatre... you'll find them. There is a drugstore or even two in any segment of the Town. And what are antibiotics?]]></string>
<string id="537345"><![CDATA[Ask the druggist—and then go ahead and buy all sorts of them.]]></string>
<string id="537346"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>

<string id="537353"><![CDATA[I'm dying for a gulp of milk... But they won't let us milk the cows. Do you by any chance have some?]]></string>
<string id="537354"><![CDATA[Who doesn't let you milk cows?]]></string>
<string id="537355"><![CDATA[Well, people say that cows have been oozing some ichor instead of milk lately. Auntie said she knows this for sure, and Mom nodded and added that Ayga, the cook, agrees—and she's a Steppewoman and all... she knows everything about cows. Ayga even went as far as to say that milk turned completely black.]]></string>
<string id="537356"><![CDATA[She's right; doesn't sound like you should drink such milk. I'll check on your cows or assign this task to someone.]]></string>
<string id="537357"><![CDATA[This story alone would be enough to make me never drink milk ever again.]]></string>

<string id="537359"><![CDATA[Did you want to ask me something?]]></string>
<string id="537360"><![CDATA[Yes. Have you tested our shmowders?]]></string>
<string id="537361"><![CDATA[Shm-what?]]></string>
<string id="537362"><![CDATA[I remember us playing shmowders. We used to invent various recipes, taking various amounts of various medicines and mixing them. It was like a competition—whose recipe would turn out to be the most efficient? And, well… some of them were.]]></string>
<string id="537363"><![CDATA[How is it possible?]]></string>
<string id="537364"><![CDATA[Now I realize that it was all accidental. But the thing is, everyone who participated in the game made more than one shmowder following their recipe. That means there have to be several more efficient shmowders in the town—we only need to figure out whose solution was the useful one.]]></string>
<string id="537365"><![CDATA[Hmm… And how would I find this child prodigy if I ever went looking for them?]]></string>
<string id="537366"><![CDATA[We don't know that either... Crowfoot's completely lost any skill, Beaker's brothers have died. And no one knows who else was talented with shmowders! There was this one guy… but I doubt he remembers anything at all. We were very little back then, you know. We were simply stealing the prettiest pills—no one really bothered to read labels.]]></string>

<string id="537371"><![CDATA[And where does one find these old caches?]]></string>
<string id="537372"><![CDATA[At the Dovecot or the Mild Dew… Why do you ask? It's not like there's anything left there—except maybe several "dead" shmowders. The ones that kill instantly.]]></string>
<string id="537373"><![CDATA[Show me anyway. What's deadly to a five-year-old can become the salvation of an adult.]]></string>
<string id="537374"><![CDATA[Fine, whatever.]]></string>

<string id="537382"><![CDATA[What do you mean, "stinks"? Stinks with what?]]></string>
<string id="537383"><![CDATA[Who do you think I am, a professional stinker? I don't know! But the stench is awful, and tons of dead fish get washed ashore. Their bellies are all soft, white, and bloated… Yuck… I wonder if the water's been poisoned?]]></string>
<string id="537384"><![CDATA[Could be, could be...]]></string>
<string id="537385"><![CDATA[I didn't see anything of the kind.]]></string>
<string id="537386"><![CDATA[Do elaborate. Are you saying it's abnormal?]]></string>
<string id="537387"><![CDATA[Of course! We've got a very clean river here, the girls and I even drank directly from it. But recently water's become filled with fish scales—and the pollution is so thick, as if someone's mixed in this… substance there on purpose. You know, you just put your arm into the water, and when it's out, it looks like a mermaid tail, all scaled. And now it stinks too!]]></string>
<string id="537388"><![CDATA[Well, what do you know...]]></string>
<string id="537389"><![CDATA[It's just silt.]]></string>
<string id="537390"><![CDATA[Do you by any chance know where I could get some water around here?]]></string>
<string id="537391"><![CDATA[Almost all barrels have been emptied, but you may luck into leftover water in some of them. You can bottle it up and sell it! I wonder how much a single sip of water will cost in two days…]]></string>

<string id="537404"><![CDATA[What made you think that?]]></string>
<string id="537405"><![CDATA[Dad and other men attacked the guards yesterday and pried a meat storage open. The meat was then distributed among our neighbourhood. Then almost all of them fell sick… And I'm so afraid Mom and I will fall sick and die too…]]></string>

<string id="537434"><![CDATA[Are you for real? All right then. Here's the tale of the Gorkhon river and its tributaties, the Gullet and the Guzzle. Long time ago there lived an old man by the name of Bai Uraggha. He had the head of a bull, the body of a man, and the cow's hooves for hands.]]></string>
<string id="537435"><![CDATA[What about his legs?]]></string>
<string id="537436"><![CDATA[His legs stretched all across the earth, sinking into it like gigantic roots. He ate rocks, grass, and the trees that were to be found in his vicinity at first. But it didn't take him long to eat everything that his head could reach, and so the ground around him turned to desert.]]></string>
<string id="537437"><![CDATA[Then what happened?]]></string>
<string id="537438"><![CDATA[All in all, he was gluttonous and helpless. After eating everything he could reach, old Bai Uraggha felt thirsty. Guess what happened next?]]></string>
<string id="537439"><![CDATA[I can't possibly imagine.]]></string>
<string id="537440"><![CDATA[Think some more then. I'll tell you the ending if you tell me what happened after he felt thirsty.]]></string>
<string id="537441"><![CDATA[Fine.]]></string>
<string id="537442"><![CDATA[He must have died.]]></string>
<string id="537443"><![CDATA[Correct!]]></string>
<string id="537444"><![CDATA[What does it have to do with the river?]]></string>
<string id="537445"><![CDATA[That's part two of the tale. I'll tell you later.]]></string>

<string id="537456"><![CDATA[Well… Would we eat you? Of course we wouldn't—and you're obviously nuts too. Eating nuts! It's like eating your kitten or your stamps collection. Every nut is a story!

<string id="537464"><![CDATA[He's just a person, same as you.]]></string>
<string id="537465"><![CDATA[Great! That means he can be killed! Do you think I could ask for an audience with him and secretly bring a dagger with me? Will I make a good killer?]]></string>
<string id="537466"><![CDATA[And how would you lull him into a false sense of security?]]></string>
<string id="537467"><![CDATA[I'll try to seduce him. And if he remains passionless, I'll pretend to be a petitioner. I'll kneel before him, crawl to him as if I was trying to grab his hand—and then I'll pierce him with the dagger, right through the heart!]]></string>
<string id="537468"><![CDATA[What an ingenious and elaborate plan.]]></string>

<string id="537476"><![CDATA[Yesterday, the soldiers shot almost all the dogs of the Soul-and-a-Halves. The only survivors were Pong, Mittens, and Lobe. So several boys sharpened their bolts, took their crossbows, and went to the soldiers to get revenge. They haven't come back yet.]]></string>

<string id="537484"><![CDATA[A girl named Clara was looking for you. She said she wanted to propose a path to salvation to you. By the way, do you know that she collects people's souls and demands they sign the contracts with blood?]]></string>
<string id="537485"><![CDATA[No, I didn't know that. Why is she doing this?]]></string>
<string id="537486"><![CDATA[Oh... It's all very complicated—and it makes me very uncomfortable. Everyone's afraid of a maneater for a reason, you know. I think she strikes a deal with them so that they would allow her to use their bodies posthumously somehow… to save everyone.]]></string>
<string id="537487"><![CDATA[Is that so... and do people agree?]]></string>
<string id="537488"><![CDATA[She has about a dozen signatures, I think. But she needs thirty or forty, something like that. She says that she'll be able to arrange a happy ending for everyone then.]]></string>

<string id="537564"><![CDATA[He has no choice! He wants to help everyone. He is actually not a Ripper, he's a Haruspex. He is a lot like you, honest and kind. Maybe he's your brother?]]></string>

<string id="537576"><![CDATA[She put pressure on his eyes and temples—here and here—with her hands. It went on for a while. Then she held his head in her embrace and kissed his nails.

<string id="537625"><![CDATA[I guess so…]]></string>
<string id="537626"><![CDATA[No need to guess, it's obvious. And Mark—he knows the truth and is afraid to distort it. That's why he uses masks, puppets, and riddles.]]></string>

<string id="537654"><![CDATA[I can't say I care for her all that much.]]></string>

<string id="537656"><![CDATA[My call indeed.]]></string>

<string id="537659"><![CDATA[Hey kid, where is the Hindquarters?]]></string>
<string id="537660"><![CDATA[It's on the Gullet's bank. It's where The Willows and the pub are located, and the Works are by the Hindquarters' side.]]></string>
<string id="537661"><![CDATA[What is the Gullet?]]></string>
<string id="537662"><![CDATA[The river that cuts the town transversely. The one closer to the Abattoir.]]></string>

<string id="537664"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="537665"><![CDATA[Could you point me the way to the Crude Sprawl?]]></string>
<string id="537666"><![CDATA[Ooh... it's on the outskirts of the town, by the cemetery and the Abattoir. If you keep going past it—kinda diagonally, you know?—you'll get to the Rotten Field.]]></string>
<string id="537667"><![CDATA[And... what's the Rotten Field?]]></string>
<string id="537668"><![CDATA[It's where they bury the bulls' bones. The place is covered with fur instead of grass, and it's all bones bones bones underground. Bones and horns. Yeah.]]></string>
<string id="537669"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="537670"><![CDATA[Thanks.]]></string>
<string id="537671"><![CDATA[Tell me about the Theatre.]]></string>
<string id="537672"><![CDATA[Oh, it's our piece de resistance! The place for the most significant things to happen! The shows they do... puppet plays about a shade, an orphan that came out victorious, a little thief girl, and a scientist who made the world end! Lots of stuff!]]></string>
<string id="537673"><![CDATA[So it's a puppet show, huh.]]></string>
<string id="537674"><![CDATA[Not only that! They also have the Masks perform every evening, but I'm not allowed to those shows.]]></string>
<string id="537675"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>

<string id="537678"><![CDATA[And where is it?]]></string>
<string id="537679"><![CDATA[On Spin-a-Yarn Square, duh!]]></string>
<string id="537680"><![CDATA[And where is that?]]></string>
<string id="537681"><![CDATA[It's in the Marrow district. That's in the middle of the Knots, closer to the Guzzle.]]></string>
<string id="537682"><![CDATA[What is the Guzzle?]]></string>
<string id="537683"><![CDATA[It's when you're very very hungry and eat or drink something very very quickly. Look, here.]]></string>
<string id="537684"><![CDATA[Yeah, I know what guzzling is.]]></string>
<string id="537685"><![CDATA[It's a transversal river. The one closer to the Polyhedron.]]></string>
<string id="537686"><![CDATA[Now I see.]]></string>
<string id="537687"><![CDATA[Thank you for clearing this up for me. I was at a loss before this enlightening lesson.]]></string>

<string id="537691"><![CDATA[Why not?]]></string>
<string id="537692"><![CDATA[Because we won't let you in anyway. There's a secret room inside.]]></string>
<string id="537693"><![CDATA[And what's in there?]]></string>
<string id="537694"><![CDATA[Like I said, a secret.]]></string>
<string id="537695"><![CDATA[Well, suit youself.]]></string>
<string id="537696"><![CDATA[Who is "us"?]]></string>

<string id="537701"><![CDATA[Okay then, no pressure.]]></string>
<string id="537702"><![CDATA[What's that Cathedral in the central square?]]></string>
<string id="537703"><![CDATA[It's not the central square at all, it's Bridge Square. And the central square is the Spin-a-Yarn one.]]></string>
<string id="537704"><![CDATA[Why is it called Bridge Square?]]></string>
<string id="537705"><![CDATA[Because at first no one knew there was going to be the Tower, so the plan was to create a square that would be completely situated on a very large bridge, like that wide! They would make a fun-fair there.]]></string>
<string id="537706"><![CDATA[Well, I guess the Tower is quite more compelling.]]></string>
<string id="537707"><![CDATA[Of course it is. I mean, there could have been magicians at the fun-fair... But the Tower is way more exciting than any magic tricks.]]></string>
<string id="537708"><![CDATA[Why is that?]]></string>
<string id="537709"><![CDATA[Well… Because.]]></string>
<string id="537710"><![CDATA[You have masterfully evaded the question.]]></string>
<string id="537711"><![CDATA[And still—what about the Cathedral?]]></string>
<string id="537712"><![CDATA[I don't know... Never been there. My sister attends it sometimes. And always comes back with a handful of love letters!]]></string>

<string id="537715"><![CDATA[I think… twenty? I think.]]></string>
<string id="537716"><![CDATA[Then it makes sense.]]></string>
<string id="537717"><![CDATA[A pity the plan fell through!]]></string>
<string id="537718"><![CDATA[No it's not! The Polyhedron is obviously better! What would they sell at the fun-fair? The things that the train delivers? You can get them in any store already. It's boring... no toys, no stickjaws, no fireworks...]]></string>
<string id="537719"><![CDATA[They'd think of something.]]></string>

<string id="537762"><![CDATA[My brother told me. He did. She walked right behind an armed mugger as he squatted trying to ambush someone. Brother was keeping an eye on him.

<string id="537774"><![CDATA[At first it was believed to be about the Mistresses, Maria and Capella. But I'm so fond of Maria! She shines from the inside and she's all magical! I'll never in a million years believe that she's shabnak-adyr the maneater. So it has to be a spirit thing. And that means Clara is one of them…]]></string>
<string id="537775"><![CDATA[Is she? Which one? The good or the bad?]]></string>
<string id="537776"><![CDATA[Sounds unconvincing. The Mistress interpretation is actually more plausible.]]></string>
<string id="537777"><![CDATA[Whoa... And which dead people are wrong?]]></string>
<string id="537778"><![CDATA[The ones that were only half-buried. They were naughty in life, and the Earth couldn't digest them. So their bones make evil spirits. You'd better ask Grace, she explains it very well.]]></string>
<string id="537779"><![CDATA[And what does Clara have to do with all this?]]></string>
<string id="537780"><![CDATA[I see. I'll ask Grace for clarification.]]></string>
<string id="537781"><![CDATA[Nevermind. Just thinking out loud.]]></string>

<string id="537783"><![CDATA[I've heard a lot about you too.]]></string>
<string id="537784"><![CDATA[You look cheerful, that's a good sight.]]></string>
<string id="537785"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="537786"><![CDATA[Do not condemn us for our lasciviousness. That's just how the local customs and morals are…]]></string>
<string id="537787"><![CDATA[Do give me a shoulder massage, girl. I'm tired. My muscles ache.]]></string>
<string id="537788"><![CDATA[Let me kiss you, will you? It will invigorate me.]]></string>
<string id="537789"><![CDATA[I have something for you. ]]></string>
<string id="537790"><![CDATA[If this is a token on your affection, then I shall offer you the last thing I have in exchange.]]></string>
<string id="537791"><![CDATA[Deal. Let's barter.]]></string>
<string id="537792"><![CDATA[I've heard the word "maneater" repeated more than once today. What was it all about?]]></string>
<string id="537793"><![CDATA[Soft flesh, warm blood... So sweet! I can constantly feel it with my whole body. There is a maneater in any of us girls. Wouldn't you agree, darling? ]]></string>
<string id="537794"><![CDATA[I agree, but I also find anthropophagism terrifying.]]></string>
<string id="537795"><![CDATA[Well, you don't really think she dragged Simon to the kitchen and is boiling him there on a slow fire, do you? Of course not. It's all very metaphoric. If he's overwhelmed by her, if he's into her, if she had her way with him… then she's a maneater.]]></string>
<string id="537796"><![CDATA[Who, Simon? I thought he was two hundred years old at least.]]></string>
<string id="537797"><![CDATA[Flesh is eloquent! It says a lot about its owner. Simon's body was made from very tough flesh and very hot blood. A body to be jealous of… like yours. It would be a shame is shabnak tracked you down.]]></string>
<string id="537798"><![CDATA[Why don't we talk about something lovely instead? Like you, for example.]]></string>
<string id="537799"><![CDATA[You know there's only one thing on my mind…]]></string>
<string id="537800"><![CDATA[I can see that.]]></string>
<string id="537801"><![CDATA[You've had a bit too much.]]></string>
<string id="537802"><![CDATA[Enough, please. ]]></string>
<string id="537803"><![CDATA[Metaphoric?]]></string>
<string id="537804"><![CDATA[Are you being so predatory on purpose? These little games of yours can end badly, you know.]]></string>
<string id="537805"><![CDATA[Tell me about your customs. ]]></string>
<string id="537806"><![CDATA[The body is sacred. The naked body is the most accurate image of the world. People used to tend to their bodies as if each of them were a shrine. Cripples and freaks used to be banished from the community not so long ago—just before the Saburovs came to power. Such was the bidding of the Kin. They were devoured by the Steppe. Earth corrected its mistakes.]]></string>
<string id="537807"><![CDATA[Why do you strip your sacred body naked then?]]></string>
<string id="537808"><![CDATA[Because I know the Dance and have the right to do so. But in the Termitary they wrap themselves in so many clothes and cloths that it becomes impossible to make out human features beneath all that. They cover their bodies to set up some protection againts evil spirits. And it's not like they worry about themselves...]]></string>
<string id="537809"><![CDATA[Who are they worried about then, my sweet dervish?]]></string>
<string id="537810"><![CDATA[They know that the body doesn't belong to them. Who would be hurt if a bull were to bite a finger off them? The whole bottomless cosmos would. Everything is akin to everything and everything is interconnected with everything. You know about that, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="537811"><![CDATA[It contradicts natural sciences, but… generally it can be accepted that your theory has the right to exist.]]></string>
<string id="537812"><![CDATA[Oh, you killjoy... So many words! Why don't you just smile instead?]]></string>
<string id="537813"><![CDATA[There, is that better?]]></string>
<string id="537814"><![CDATA[Of course I do, my pretty. You stop being smart over there and just dance, okay?]]></string>
<string id="537815"><![CDATA[Is your dance special in some way?]]></string>
<string id="537816"><![CDATA[Yes. It is a tribute to our world's beauty.]]></string>
<string id="537817"><![CDATA[Oh, that I'm perfectly willing to accept.]]></string>
<string id="537818"><![CDATA[What happened to them next?]]></string>
<string id="537819"><![CDATA[That's the scary part! The locals believed that if the Steppe doesn't accept a freak back into her womb, they'll creep out again as an evil spirit—a nastail, a mara, or a shabnak-adyr. That's how it goes. And that's why no one really cared for freaks around here.]]></string>
<string id="537820"><![CDATA[Some cruel utopia was being built here.]]></string>
<string id="537821"><![CDATA[Not even close, as they say... But butchers can feel it very acutely. They have to. It's the law of survival. A guarantee that the world wouldn't turn against them one day... Like it does now.]]></string>
<string id="537822"><![CDATA[So, the whole issue is that somebody had had their little finger cut off… And here I am, running around and trying to find the reason behind all this.]]></string>

<string id="537826"><![CDATA[Do you like me? ]]></string>
<string id="537827"><![CDATA[They say you're the smart hero.]]></string>
<string id="537828"><![CDATA[That is correct. I'm an intellectual. That means I'm very smart.]]></string>
<string id="537829"><![CDATA[How are you smart? Smart people are four-eyed nerds… bulgy heads on stunted legs. Cunning, cautious, weak, old even… no, you are not a smart man. You are a warrior.]]></string>
<string id="537830"><![CDATA[So intelligence is a sign of weakness to you?]]></string>
<string id="537831"><![CDATA[That's just common knowledge. Women of the Steppe do not love smart men. We love violent men, furious men, we love destroyers. Were you not one of those, would I have fallen in love with you?]]></string>
<string id="537832"><![CDATA[You are correct. I am a destroyer. ]]></string>
<string id="537833"><![CDATA[How so? ]]></string>
<string id="537834"><![CDATA[I destroy lies with my mind.]]></string>
<string id="537835"><![CDATA[Oh... So that's why there are always sparks of hatred in your eyes. And that's why your smile is so spiteful.]]></string>

<string id="537840"><![CDATA[You can be both.]]></string>
<string id="537841"><![CDATA[Really? I thought you can only have one. Your eyes are throwing needles, and your teeth are clenched fast. You've got the face of a man who can sweep down anything that stands in his way. The face of a destroyer.]]></string>
<string id="537842"><![CDATA[Correct. This is the true purpose of smart people.]]></string>
<string id="537843"><![CDATA[You know so much about me! I wonder how?]]></string>
<string id="537844"><![CDATA[It's a den... Everyone loosens their tongues here. Some due to alcohol, some due to swevery, and some due to delight. You can't remember who says what, but everyone is talking about you. They say you don't look like a smart man.]]></string>
<string id="537845"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="537846"><![CDATA[Tell me my fortune, sweet girl.]]></string>
<string id="537847"><![CDATA[How am I supposed to tell your fortune? You don't have a heart.]]></string>

<string id="537850"><![CDATA[What makes you say that?]]></string>
<string id="537851"><![CDATA[You are absolutely heartless. Seems like pity is alien to you. Even your obsession can't really be called a feeling.]]></string>
<string id="537852"><![CDATA[My weapon is cold reason. It has no need of emotions. ]]></string>
<string id="537853"><![CDATA[You are correct. Pity is not the feeling I foster.]]></string>

<string id="537855"><![CDATA[You are very beautiful. ]]></string>
<string id="537856"><![CDATA[Do you really never tell lies?]]></string>
<string id="537857"><![CDATA[I hate lies. ]]></string>

<string id="537859"><![CDATA[It is through lies that the weak and the dishonest set their dark plans into motion.]]></string>
<string id="537860"><![CDATA[What makes you think they have to be dark?]]></string>
<string id="537861"><![CDATA[Because they replace the true state of affairs with a false one to profit from someone else's suffering.]]></string>
<string id="537862"><![CDATA[It's in their nature. ]]></string>
<string id="537863"><![CDATA[I don't have a heart, remember?]]></string>
<string id="537864"><![CDATA[Nothing is more villanous than deceit. ]]></string>
<string id="537865"><![CDATA[Why? I didn't say "deceit". Telling a lie doesn't equal deceit.]]></string>
<string id="537866"><![CDATA[All my life those who pretended that black was white prohibited me from winning. Every deceit hides someone's dark intentions.]]></string>

<string id="537868"><![CDATA[Look, there are so many of them around… A thousand and a half, no less! Every third of us is boiling alive. Every single one is ready to drag his fellow man with him. So which one do you need?]]></string>
<string id="537869"><![CDATA[No, you don't understand. I need the person that spreads the infection but doesn't get sick in the process.]]></string>
<string id="537870"><![CDATA[Like the Typhoid Maid? ]]></string>
<string id="537871"><![CDATA[Yes. Precisely.]]></string>
<string id="537872"><![CDATA[How horrible... Perhaps she doesn't even know herself how dangerous she is. Can you imagine? She must feel nothing…]]></string>
<string id="537873"><![CDATA[Wait a moment! Why are you saying it's a "she" rather than a "he"?]]></string>
<string id="537874"><![CDATA[I don't know... It just slipped out. Maybe it's because we were talking about the Maid. And everyone's looking for a female maneater, you know. It must be the same wretch… All in all, it just slipped out.]]></string>
<string id="537875"><![CDATA[All right... ]]></string>
<string id="537876"><![CDATA[I feel that you know more than you're letting show.]]></string>
<string id="537877"><![CDATA[What Typhoid Maid?]]></string>
<string id="537878"><![CDATA[People say all kinds of things around here, you know… So they say that in a faraway land beyond the sea, in the West, there was a horrible pestilence a hundred years ago. Only in their case it was typhoid. And then it turned out it was all because of a maid. She worked for modest households, went from one kitchen to another to make soup. She was sick with typhoid, but in such a fashion that she didn't die.]]></string>
<string id="537879"><![CDATA[Yes, exactly. Perhaps someone like her is walking this place too.]]></string>
<string id="537880"><![CDATA[Yes, you are right… and each one fits the bill.]]></string>
<string id="537881"><![CDATA[What's the word in the den?]]></string>
<string id="537882"><![CDATA[Turns out the Inquisitor is late Mistress Nina' sister. A younger one. I wonder if they are alike…]]></string>
<string id="537883"><![CDATA[This cannot be! ]]></string>
<string id="537884"><![CDATA[Can you imagine? I stood their gaping too. Some of those who were loyal to Nina came to pay their respects to the sister of the late Mistress. They came to pay respects—but ended up paying a terrible price for that! We were too rash to assume that such an inquisitor wouldn't execute people.]]></string>
<string id="537885"><![CDATA[But why? For being loyal to Nina?]]></string>
<string id="537886"><![CDATA[They hate one another. Or rather the inquisitor hates the Mistress. I think Nina probably disregarded her at all. Not a single person who knew Nina—take Andrey, for example—remembered her ever talking of having a sister…]]></string>
<string id="537887"><![CDATA[How do you know that? ]]></string>
<string id="537888"><![CDATA[Ah, I don't know... Rumour has it. Andrey has a face like thunder, see? Although I can't say he was surprised by the news. Perhaps he did know beforehand?]]></string>
<string id="537889"><![CDATA[Perhaps.]]></string>
<string id="537890"><![CDATA[Curious…]]></string>
<string id="537891"><![CDATA[What does that entail?]]></string>

<string id="537907"><![CDATA[Could you please remind me what prophecies you're talking about?]]></string>
<string id="537908"><![CDATA[That Simon is meant to live forever. They said he had died—but he hadn't! The Kains will transfer his soul to the Polyhedron, and it will flicker there eternally, shining its light upon us.]]></string>
<string id="537909"><![CDATA[And how are they going to do that?]]></string>
<string id="537910"><![CDATA[I don't know... Why are you asking me about it? I have no skill to talk about it. That's what Yulia—or better yet, Maria—is for.]]></string>

<string id="537914"><![CDATA[How can I not? The soul is immortal, but it gradually departs the world of the living and goes away into space, faraway and cold. If you let it go, it will be lost in the void forever.]]></string>

<string id="537940"><![CDATA[So they are going to attack me, but not you? How in the world does that work?]]></string>
<string id="537941"><![CDATA[Well, you is doc. We patrolpeople have nothing to offer them but a good old blow on the head, and we won't let them out. They tried to escape, there's no denying that. They did. We taught them a lesson though. And we're protected, too, thanks to you.]]></string>
<string id="537942"><![CDATA[Protected?]]></string>
<string id="537943"><![CDATA[Yessir… They've distributed them pills among us, told us 'twas on your orders. Told us they're very much a good remedy to invigorate the body, but bad for the heart.

<string id="537956"><![CDATA[I do… Our guys used to take them from Stakh, Isidor's apprentice. Way better than them pellets. We distribute those among the population—they love pellets, especially the ladies. But a brew's a solid thing. That's why we're standing here all engulfed in the pest—and we couldn't care less...

<string id="537974"><![CDATA[Didn't think about going there anyway. Say, how come such a tiny town is divided into districts?]]></string>
<string id="537975"><![CDATA[I've hated beef for as long as I can remember.]]></string>
<string id="537976"><![CDATA["The Districts"? A peculiar way to call the… well, the town itself.]]></string>
<string id="537977"><![CDATA[Well, it just sort of came to be that way... The Gullet and the Guzzle—the Gorkhon's tributaries—divide the town into three parts; each of them consists of many separate courtyards, so maybe that's the reason.]]></string>
<string id="537978"><![CDATA[And what are those parts?]]></string>
<string id="537979"><![CDATA[The lower part, adjacent to the Abattoir, is called Earth. The one between the Gullet and the Guzzle we call the Knots. And the triangular promontory between the Guzzle and the Gorkhon is the Stone Yard.]]></string>
<string id="537980"><![CDATA[That's… intricate. What about the districts' names?]]></string>
<string id="537981"><![CDATA[The Stone Yard consists of two districts: the Bridge Square and the Atrium—plus the Mistresses' Tombs, of course. Earth has four residential districts: the Skinners, the Tanners, the Hindquarters, and Crude Sprawl. In the middle...]]></string>
<string id="537982"><![CDATA[Is something wrong?]]></string>
<string id="537983"><![CDATA[I'm just not sure you need any of this... The Knots have seven districts: the Spleen, the Marrow, the Chine, the Backbone, the Mouth, the Flank, and the Gut. I don't suppose I need to go into further details; surely the Kains will show you around. They are expecting you after all.]]></string>

<string id="537988"><![CDATA[And what's inside of that... Polyhedron?]]></string>
<string id="537989"><![CDATA[Nothing really... Children like to play there, I guess. And they say it's perfectly empty, bare as the palm of your hand. What could there be inside such a monstrosity? I find it unbelievable that it's still standing at all. I'd never let my children enter the damn thing. Ever.]]></string>
<string id="537990"><![CDATA[I see. What about the Bull Project?]]></string>
<string id="537991"><![CDATA[So you've never actually been there yourself?]]></string>
<string id="537992"><![CDATA[The kids don't like it when we grown-ups try to visit them in the Polyhedron… Not like there's anything special in there. Why would anyone even want to climb that thing?]]></string>
<string id="537993"><![CDATA[All right. By the way, why do you call your town "the Districts"?]]></string>
<string id="537994"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="537995"><![CDATA[Tell me about the Town Hall.]]></string>
<string id="537996"><![CDATA[The Town Hall is the most useless place in the whole town, I'm telling you. The only thing it's good at is taking up space. It's the most prominent building in the Backbone. Sinister... and still useless.]]></string>
<string id="537997"><![CDATA[Why useless?]]></string>
<string id="537998"><![CDATA[Because we are ruled by the—well—Rulers. There are no officials around here, and no need for them, too. You want to know what's up there, in the Town Hall? The post office and the jail, nothing more. It's fine; they'll finally repurpose the building someday. Turn it into a school maybe? Whatever the facility, it would still be of better use.]]></string>
<string id="537999"><![CDATA[I see. How do I get to the Backbone?]]></string>
<string id="538000"><![CDATA[How come you still haven't got a map? You're lost for good without one! The Backbone is in the Knots. That's the middle part of the Districts, between the Gullet and the Guzzle.]]></string>
<string id="538001"><![CDATA[Much obliged.]]></string>
<string id="538002"><![CDATA[A school instead of a jail? Great idea.]]></string>
<string id="538003"><![CDATA[What is the Termitary?]]></string>
<string id="538004"><![CDATA[Two massive buildings in the eastern part of Earth. The Termitary marks the Districts' border. Beyond that there is only the Abattoir and then the Steppe itself. People do not belong there.]]></string>
<string id="538005"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="538006"><![CDATA[Well... They just don't. It's not a people place.]]></string>
<string id="538007"><![CDATA[But someone has to work there, right?]]></string>
<string id="538008"><![CDATA[Some… folk do. The Steppe people, the butchers. That's way outside of your area of expertise, believe me.]]></string>
<string id="538009"><![CDATA[That was intriguing, my good man.]]></string>
<string id="538010"><![CDATA[I have a feeling you're not much of a talker.]]></string>
<string id="538011"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="538012"><![CDATA[The Warehouses is a district as well, right?]]></string>
<string id="538013"><![CDATA[It is. But there's not much to tell about it… It consists of two parts. The first part is where everything that the town exports is stored: meat, sausage, ham, bone meal, and so on. The other one stores various hardware, and also the manufactured goods that the regular train delivers.]]></string>
<string id="538014"><![CDATA[And how do I get there?]]></string>
<string id="538015"><![CDATA[That's in the Knots—its southeasternmost part, to be precise. To the east of the Station. The meat warehouses are the ones closer to the Station, the hardware ones are closer to the town. There's a railroad track running between them.]]></string>
<string id="538016"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="538017"><![CDATA[Tell me about Nina.]]></string>
<string id="538018"><![CDATA[When Nina died, everyone was terrified. No one could wrap their mind around it; it was truly and utterly unthinkable—and yet it happened. Dying is not really a common habit around here, you see. And so when Nina passed away, everyone started saying that a shabnak came for her soul, or maybe a turnskin... a creature from beyond.]]></string>
<string id="538019"><![CDATA[I see. But what can you tell me about Nina herself? Her name doesn't really ring that many bells to me.]]></string>
<string id="538020"><![CDATA[Nina Kaina! Nina the sorceress... The most gorgeous woman I've ever seen. So wild and fierce and intimidating! Just one brief look at her walking down the street—with or without her escort—could make you weak in the knees. You could almost picture her upon a throne. She could cut you with a knife looking you in the eye—and no one would say a thing. Only a shabnak could take that one.]]></string>
<string id="538021"><![CDATA[So what, did anyone find the turnskin?]]></string>
<string id="538022"><![CDATA[Not really.]]></string>
<string id="538023"><![CDATA[So now you want to give it another try?]]></string>
<string id="538024"><![CDATA[Very funny…]]></string>
<string id="538025"><![CDATA[I'm not in the mood for laughing. At all.]]></string>
<string id="538026"><![CDATA[Now that's a twist.]]></string>
<string id="538027"><![CDATA[What is a "shabnak"?]]></string>
<string id="538028"><![CDATA[A make-believe monster from the Steppe... A bloodsucker of some sort... just, you know, a revenant from beyond. Or maybe a possessing demon... I don't really believe in such things. On the other hand, sometimes the things you see... Live here long enough and you'll get used to all kinds of weirdness. The Steppe is wiser than we are.]]></string>
<string id="538029"><![CDATA[Uh huh. Definitely wiser.]]></string>
<string id="538030"><![CDATA[Where is the Station?]]></string>
<string id="538031"><![CDATA[Didn't you get here by train?]]></string>
<string id="538032"><![CDATA[I got here by chance. How do I find the Station?]]></string>
<string id="538033"><![CDATA[The Station is not a part of the Districts... It's a part of the Bull Project. It is located in the southernmost part of the town. Attached to it, so to speak. And still, how did you get here? If our regular train was here... ]]></string>
<string id="538034"><![CDATA[What is a regular train?]]></string>
<string id="538035"><![CDATA[A goods train which delivers edibles and other things... As you can see, we have nothing around here. The train usually comes on the 25th of every month... but now it's already two weeks past due! The last one was here in July.]]></string>
<string id="538036"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="538037"><![CDATA[I got here on a switch engine.]]></string>
<string id="538038"><![CDATA[I asked you first.]]></string>
<string id="538039"><![CDATA[Tell me about the Abattoir.]]></string>
<string id="538040"><![CDATA[Just your regular abattoir.]]></string>
<string id="538041"><![CDATA[Clear as daylight.]]></string>
<string id="538042"><![CDATA[Death is never a habit—not even someone else's. You can't really get used to it.]]></string>
<string id="538043"><![CDATA[What is the history of this place?]]></string>
<string id="538044"><![CDATA[The town was built step by step.]]></string>
<string id="538045"><![CDATA[Please do tell more. Yesterday I had a geography lesson, today let's have a background review.]]></string>
<string id="538046"><![CDATA[The town grew bigger as the owners of the Bull Project grew richer. Eventually the Town of Beasts surrendered and became the Town of Men.]]></string>
<string id="538047"><![CDATA[Go on...]]></string>
<string id="538048"><![CDATA[The Town of Beasts nurtured the Town of Men—and demanded nothing in return. That's how the Districts came to be. The inhabitants of the Town of Men didn't really concern themselves with bulls. All they did was build, trade, and craft... Even the smell is somehow not omnipresent.]]></string>
<string id="538049"><![CDATA[Fascinating.]]></string>
<string id="538050"><![CDATA[The town is thriving. Life couldn't be better.]]></string>
<string id="538051"><![CDATA[Sounds like a real utopia. It's mind-boggling to think that this is all possible in a small community built upon a gigantic factory.]]></string>
<string id="538052"><![CDATA[That's because our rulers prefer investing into the local environment. ]]></string>
<string id="538053"><![CDATA[And why is that?]]></string>
<string id="538054"><![CDATA[I think they kind of feel like the rulers of the world—and it makes sense, after a fashion. Our self-sufficient town is a world; it became a model of the Universe. See? It's lost in the Steppe void, brought up by the ancient traditions of our savage people.]]></string>
<string id="538055"><![CDATA[Whoa! That's some big words.]]></string>
<string id="538056"><![CDATA[Good day to you.]]></string>
<string id="538057"><![CDATA[Good point, by the way. Judging by the size of your... Abattoir, the production must also be massive; the whole place is supposed to be reeking of bulls!]]></string>
<string id="538058"><![CDATA[Miraculously, it doesn't. The Abattoir doesn't let the scent of death out. All the stench in Earth comes from the factories. And even that is negligible, really... Well, that's just one of the peculiar quirks of the place.]]></string>
<string id="538059"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="538060"><![CDATA[What exactly do you mean by the "Town of Beasts"?]]></string>
<string id="538061"><![CDATA[Just, you know... It's absolutely barbaric. Bulls set the pace there, not people. And the people that work with the beasts aren't really so far ahead of them, evolutionarily speaking.]]></string>
<string id="538062"><![CDATA[I see. So what happened next?]]></string>
<string id="538063"><![CDATA[Have a good day.]]></string>
<string id="538064"><![CDATA[Three different worlds coexist within the town. Surprisingly, they are all in accord, but it's really startling that they are—and unclear how that's possible.]]></string>
<string id="538065"><![CDATA[I've noticed that too.]]></string>
<string id="538066"><![CDATA[On the other hand, people of the three worlds don't really mix with each other. Though coexisting, traditionally the parts remain separate.]]></string>
<string id="538067"><![CDATA[But what was the foundation stone, so to speak? The Abattoir?]]></string>
<string id="538068"><![CDATA[Historically, the oldest craft around here was tanning; eventually a group of factories sprouted on the river bank. About eighty years ago that settlement burned away, and then the Abattoir was constructed.]]></string>
<string id="538069"><![CDATA[It was only constructed eighty years ago? Unbelievable! I was sure that was some sort of a megalith...]]></string>
<string id="538070"><![CDATA[Later on people wanted to refashion it into a factory. There had been some unusual stone formations and caves; they were... repurposed. Yeah, that was quite an eccentric solution. But a clever one, too: no need for complex constructions—just use what nature itself provided you with.]]></string>
<string id="538071"><![CDATA[Repurposed… but not refashioned into a factory? Why?]]></string>
<string id="538072"><![CDATA[The Kin resisted.]]></string>
<string id="538073"><![CDATA[How in the world is the Kin so mysteriously influential—and yet I've never had the pleasure of meeting it?]]></string>
<string id="538074"><![CDATA[Wow. It seems that the love for absurd structures is a far more ancient trend in this country than I could ever imagine.]]></string>
<string id="538075"><![CDATA[What about the Abattoir?]]></string>
<string id="538076"><![CDATA[The access to the Abattoir was restricted, so the Works emerged as a separate complex. All because the Foreman of the Abattoir made a deal with Olgimsky, promising to double the product in exchange for nonintervention into the Abattoir's internal matters.]]></string>
<string id="538077"><![CDATA[What a curious deal. Care to elaborate on that?]]></string>
<string id="538078"><![CDATA[I don't know any details, really. But rumour has it they've made an agreement. Olgimsky managed to install the current Foreman to the position of the head of the Kin—and the Foreman serves him in exchange, making sure that the whole Kin works for the Bull Project.]]></string>
<string id="538079"><![CDATA[So the profits go to Olgimsky, huh?]]></string>
<string id="538080"><![CDATA[That's right.]]></string>
<string id="538081"><![CDATA[Hmm...]]></string>
<string id="538082"><![CDATA[Farewell.]]></string>
<string id="538083"><![CDATA[I'd like to talk some more about the feudal lords. Tell me a little about the three families, please.]]></string>
<string id="538084"><![CDATA[What do you think of the Kains?]]></string>
<string id="538085"><![CDATA[I have a soft spot for resolute, outstanding, and bold people. Their kind is rare nowadays.]]></string>
<string id="538086"><![CDATA[You're right... the Kains are conquerors by nature. They fear nothing. They're up in arms and ready to overthrow any rules, any dogmas, any taboos. You have that in common with them, don't you? Well... every coin has a flip side.]]></string>
<string id="538087"><![CDATA[And what is that?]]></string>
<string id="538088"><![CDATA[The Kains are insane. Possessed, like lead performers on the stage. They're cruel; without a moment's hesitation they would sacrifice anything in the world to achieve their brilliant goals. To their credit, their sacrificial list always starts with themselves. lt has always been that way.]]></string>
<string id="538089"><![CDATA[How do you know which way it's always been?]]></string>
<string id="538090"><![CDATA[Their family goes a long way. It is at least ten centuries old. Might well be that their roots are lost in the depths of time immemorial. People used to be more attuned to magic back then, and a human life used to cost less. Do be careful around them, Bachelor…]]></string>
<string id="538091"><![CDATA[I appreciate your advice.]]></string>
<string id="538092"><![CDATA[Don't tell me what to do! I will manage my predilections without your help.]]></string>
<string id="538093"><![CDATA[It's not a random passer-by's place to be opinionated about people like us!]]></string>
<string id="538094"><![CDATA[Nothing good, I suppose. Their notion of communication is rather annoying.]]></string>
<string id="538095"><![CDATA[It is. And their policies are peculiar as well. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to sell the idea to you... I only know that they are very fond of you. It's not easy to win their favour like that.]]></string>
<string id="538096"><![CDATA[Really? And how did I win it?]]></string>
<string id="538097"><![CDATA[Thanks to Maria, I guess. She has that supernatural intuition of hers, her mother's heritage. She can feel the resolve within you, she can read your intentions; that makes her believe that you're going to help us all. And we—well, we believe along…]]></string>
<string id="538098"><![CDATA[I appreciate that.]]></string>

<string id="538110"><![CDATA[Keep your chin up, citizen.]]></string>
<string id="538111"><![CDATA[All of us will have to make a sacrifice in the end. Our town is like an aerostat: we were bold enough to take off the ground—and that means someone will inevitably have to fall down…]]></string>
<string id="538112"><![CDATA[Maybe there'll be no need for sacrifices. I'm on the verge of victory already!]]></string>
<string id="538113"><![CDATA[Maybe, may well be... But many of us would like to see the highlight of our achievement to live on... as a monument to our feat, if nothing else. If something has to be destroyed, let it be something recoverable.]]></string>
<string id="538114"><![CDATA[Why are you telling me this?]]></string>
<string id="538115"><![CDATA[Because I care! And I'm not the only one. Let the utopians live, Bachelor! Life and death are in your hands now! Save the utopians' lives, even if they are not to your liking. For it is through their deeds that we achieve immortality.]]></string>

<string id="538118"><![CDATA[And what is your idea of "the highlight of your achievement"?]]></string>
<string id="538119"><![CDATA[Everything that the utopians have created. The tangible memorial, the evidence of the human ability to make dreams come true; the proof that you only need to overcome your fear, misery, and inertia to do that. ]]></string>
<string id="538120"><![CDATA[Who do you call utopians?]]></string>
<string id="538121"><![CDATA[I'd consider at least a third of the town's population utopians. Painters and labourers, men of property and beggars, young and old. The utopians are those who believe in the power of the human spirit and the infinite scope of creativity. Take care of such people, Bachelor. Let them live.]]></string>

<string id="538143"><![CDATA[It usually does.]]></string>

<string id="538175"><![CDATA[Doesn't it have a positive side? ]]></string>
<string id="538176"><![CDATA[Of course it does... Estate is never lacking, and the constant construction projects provide workplaces. Still, we want some quiet.]]></string>
<string id="538177"><![CDATA[I understand. ]]></string>
<string id="538178"><![CDATA[And endless battle! We only dream of peace…]]></string>
<string id="538179"><![CDATA[Why are women being attacked?]]></string>
<string id="538180"><![CDATA[I seem to remember that when Victoria died everybody rushed to look for an undead "coaler".]]></string>
<string id="538181"><![CDATA[Why would they immediately rush looking for an undead… something?]]></string>
<string id="538182"><![CDATA[Victoria was a Mistress... Somehow it seemed that an ordinary creature couldn't hurt her. Her death was unexpected, she was very young. And so well-loved by the people… So the rumours started immediately that a bayun maneater has taken her soul.]]></string>
<string id="538183"><![CDATA[So what, did they try to seize every fifth man too?]]></string>
<string id="538184"><![CDATA[No... No one was seized. But there was an anxiety. There was no doubt that an evil was walking among us. You can always feel it, it changes the… density of the world. Your instincts just tell you that it's true. This is all old Steppe wisdom… and you can't avoid it, you really can't. The Steppe is wiser than we are.]]></string>
<string id="538185"><![CDATA[Superstitions like this have thrown sand in the wheels of countless scientific discoveries…]]></string>
<string id="538186"><![CDATA[Nothing to be done about it. ]]></string>
<string id="538187"><![CDATA[What the hell... ]]></string>
<string id="538188"><![CDATA[Who is Victoria? ]]></string>
<string id="538189"><![CDATA[It was arrested, I hope?]]></string>
<string id="538190"><![CDATA[Do you have enough food?]]></string>
<string id="538191"><![CDATA[Oh, we're absolutely miserable… the last of it has run out completely. We're starving, no less! How can it be? Why? People can go for forty days without food… ]]></string>
<string id="538192"><![CDATA[Starvation weakens the body. That's why.]]></string>
<string id="538193"><![CDATA[But the prices, just look at the prices! It's unheard of! A piece of stale bread costs a thousand. Where am I supposed to get that much money? How do they live with their conscience and demand that much of me when my children are starving!]]></string>
<string id="538194"><![CDATA[Are you really that low on provision?]]></string>
<string id="538195"><![CDATA[Oh, what a fool I was! And I'm not the only one... So much has been burnt and buried... We were afraid that the meat, the oat, the fish, potatoes—that it could all be infected... The day before yesterday and the day before that, we did... We didn't know that the train wouldn't come, and we just threw it all away! We expected new safe food to come.]]></string>
<string id="538196"><![CDATA[The train might come soon.]]></string>
<string id="538197"><![CDATA[No it won't... Who in their right mind would send a train here? There's a quarantine. Thanks to you!]]></string>
<string id="538198"><![CDATA[You make it sound like it was I that had ordered to block the town off.]]></string>
<string id="538199"><![CDATA[Not true. It's not about me at all. The quarantine is a desperate measure.]]></string>
<string id="538200"><![CDATA[Sanitary trains are exempt from the quarantine.]]></string>
<string id="538201"><![CDATA[You did the right thing. Starving is better than dying of infection.]]></string>
<string id="538202"><![CDATA[Profiteering always goes hand in hand with catastrophe.]]></string>
<string id="538203"><![CDATA[You're not starving. You're dying of exhaustion.]]></string>

<string id="538205"><![CDATA[Everything will be fine. ]]></string>
<string id="538206"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="538207"><![CDATA[So here we are… Once again, no one's asking us… Got a smoke?]]></string>
<string id="538208"><![CDATA[Take a look here. Can you repair this… device for me? It keeps missing the target from three yards away. And sharpen this blade too.]]></string>
<string id="538209"><![CDATA[Hey, factory man, how about fixing this barrel for me? And sharpen the knife too.]]></string>
<string id="538210"><![CDATA[Look. This gun must be ancient. It keeps misfiring. Can you fix it?]]></string>
<string id="538211"><![CDATA[Who are you? Tell me about yourself.]]></string>
<string id="538212"><![CDATA[Me? Well, eh, I'm… a factory worker… The owner treats us like dirt though. Well, I got me my own house… otherwise I would've been stuck in that husk with the rest of 'em. No going out, not even to buy bread! You just sit there gnawing at what you've stockpiled beforehand. They're completely off their rocker...]]></string>
<string id="538213"><![CDATA[What are you talking about? ]]></string>
<string id="538214"><![CDATA[The Termitary! And why? For what sins? Did we not handle the workload well enough? That might be so… But still, what are we to do now? Nah, home is best. Feels nice to have one.]]></string>
<string id="538215"><![CDATA[I can appreciate that…]]></string>
<string id="538216"><![CDATA[Moreover, living as a commune is warmer, yeah… mutual support, team spirit, all that… But when you've got one bite and a thousand mouths, one gulp and a thousand throats, support becomes irrelevant. They're starving and therefore getting weak… ]]></string>
<string id="538217"><![CDATA[You don't seem to be starving here.]]></string>
<string id="538218"><![CDATA[We don't seem to be? How about you take off your big-city goggles, eh? Just take a peek inside the Termitary—you'll turn your nose up at it in a split sec! That's where they SEEM TO BE starving all right! The train is two weeks off schedule! Yeah, it works fine for them provident squirrels. The rest are on their hunkers.]]></string>
<string id="538219"><![CDATA[So stocking up was the right choice. Good for them squirrels.]]></string>
<string id="538220"><![CDATA[Kindly stop shouting.]]></string>
<string id="538221"><![CDATA[It will all work out.]]></string>
<string id="538222"><![CDATA[Have you seen anything suspicious? ]]></string>
<string id="538223"><![CDATA[They keep going after the wrong people… What about you, doc? Can you tell a maneating mara when you see her? She's absolutely cruel… And everyone's going mad for her…]]></string>
<string id="538224"><![CDATA[A maneating what?]]></string>
<string id="538225"><![CDATA[Everybody's looking for a mara… Well, they say no one believes in her, but everyone's keeping an eye over their shoulder… You know how they paint mara? There's a girl warming her hands up, with her hair loose, all lithe and nimble, and then she bends back, peeks at you, and bam! Her face is all twigs. Heh heh...]]></string>
<string id="538226"><![CDATA[So you believe in this kind of monster?]]></string>
<string id="538227"><![CDATA[No, c'mon, I'm an adult man… On the other hand, pigs fly 'n all, y'know? If Simon can live for two hundred years, why can't a mara suck his life out? Using her twigs as sipping straws… Heh heh…]]></string>
<string id="538228"><![CDATA[You are all borderline feral here.]]></string>
<string id="538229"><![CDATA[You're a funny man, pop.]]></string>
<string id="538230"><![CDATA[Seems like recognizing her is very simple.]]></string>
<string id="538231"><![CDATA[Heh, hopefully… There was this guy five years ago too, said he'd recognize her easily too. And she walked by him—or maybe behind him—right to his very house. He closed the door behind him, but she slipped in. And, well… four coffins of the front porch. And yesterday, too...]]></string>
<string id="538232"><![CDATA[What about yesterday?]]></string>
<string id="538233"><![CDATA[You should all stay in. Go home.]]></string>
<string id="538234"><![CDATA[I'll know her when I see her.]]></string>
<string id="538235"><![CDATA[What is it, pop? Do you want to ask me something?]]></string>
<string id="538236"><![CDATA[So uh… Have you defeated the foe? Found the root of evil? I mean, like, by the way, there was an accident once… happened to a mate of mine… ]]></string>
<string id="538237"><![CDATA[I'm all agog. What happened to this worthy man? ]]></string>
<string id="538238"><![CDATA[So, you see, he broke a leg once, right? Also got himself kidney pains—it was early spring, March or so. And so he went off to gather them worts, 'twas high time for them. Said he'd sell 'em so that they're made into potions… that is, twyrine. Otherwise they're pretty worthless...]]></string>
<string id="538239"><![CDATA[Wait a minute... he went to gather worts with a broken leg? ]]></string>
<string id="538240"><![CDATA[That's the point—that's the point when he broke it! Obviously he went to gather herbs unbroken! Running around regardless of whether you're even whole or all in pieces is a modern thing. Things used to be different back then… ]]></string>
<string id="538241"><![CDATA[So what does it have to do with the turnskin?]]></string>
<string id="538242"><![CDATA[Stop interrupting me then! He wandered far off—darkness fell 'n all. So he thought he should get back. And then he feels like something has grabbed his leg. And it's all dark! So he thought that maybe he's grabbed too many herbs 'n roots, so the earth wouldn't let him go. He took the best ones too, the juiciest...]]></string>
<string id="538243"><![CDATA[Well, what was it? ]]></string>
<string id="538244"><![CDATA[He looks down—and there's something holding him, something hand-like… like a hand. Doesn't seem like a root at all, holding him fast, trying to get to his ankle. And then he sees that it's a bone hand, for real! So 'twas him, the shabnak! And so my mate tried to break free and run off. Came back home and saw that his leg was broken...]]></string>
<string id="538245"><![CDATA[I see. So why the hell did you feel the need to waste my time telling me all this?]]></string>
<string id="538246"><![CDATA[Well, he got sick, right? So 'tis all medical stuff. You're a medic. It's a useful story for you, see?]]></string>
<string id="538247"><![CDATA[You moron… ]]></string>
<string id="538248"><![CDATA[Thank you, good sir. Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="538249"><![CDATA[Why are you telling me all this rubbish, good sir?]]></string>
<string id="538250"><![CDATA[What are you trying to say? Be quick!]]></string>
<string id="538251"><![CDATA[So?]]></string>
<string id="538252"><![CDATA[Get out of my way, will you? I'm not in the mood.]]></string>
<string id="538253"><![CDATA[How are you feeling, good sir? ]]></string>
<string id="538254"><![CDATA[Yeah, exactly, I've been looking all over for you. I need to tell you something. You're a doc, so 'tis your line of work.]]></string>
<string id="538255"><![CDATA[Well, what do you need? ]]></string>
<string id="538256"><![CDATA[The Works are idle—did you know? They say you've banned all the works. Why are they working in the Tin Workshop then? Who are they canning? Huh? So they're free to work whenever they feel like it and we're supposed to starve?]]></string>
<string id="538257"><![CDATA[What are you talking about? ]]></string>
<string id="538258"><![CDATA[Pff… And you claim to be in charge here. You don't know a thing. The Works are closed off, right? Right. No benefits paid. We've got hunger pangs all over, but that's fine, we can see why. It's a sanitary measure 'n all… equal for everyone. So why is the Tin Workshop working?]]></string>
<string id="538259"><![CDATA[What do they produce there?]]></string>
<string id="538260"><![CDATA[They can meat there, that's what! So what do we do now? Who are they canning? Each other? Beef is prohibited—all right, it makes sense. It's no good sending our infected meat all over the country! But if it's safe, why ain't we working?]]></string>
<string id="538261"><![CDATA[You're not working for your own sake. Stay home and have some rest.]]></string>
<string id="538262"><![CDATA[It's you who can rest at home! We have little children at home! All of 'em hungry! We don't fear no pests, just let us earn something!]]></string>
<string id="538263"><![CDATA[Go to Olgimsky with that.]]></string>
<string id="538264"><![CDATA[There's an outbreak of a deadly disease in the town! Find a way to cope with your vacation, will you? If only because of the epidemic. You work dork…]]></string>
<string id="538265"><![CDATA[Silly rumours, nothing more. What makes you think the workshop is active?]]></string>
<string id="538266"><![CDATA[Don't you hear the noise when you walk by? Or do you think they're rolling cannon balls there?]]></string>
<string id="538267"><![CDATA[They are. Go home and await further instructions.]]></string>
<string id="538268"><![CDATA[They're dismantling equipment.]]></string>
<string id="538269"><![CDATA[It wasn't I who shut the Works down.]]></string>
<string id="538270"><![CDATA[Exactly. They're free to work and you're supposed to starve.]]></string>
<string id="538271"><![CDATA[I don't have time for this.]]></string>
<string id="538272"><![CDATA[You look the opposite of upbeat, you worker-born-and-bred… which is to say, beat up.]]></string>
<string id="538273"><![CDATA[The patrolmen have gone absolutely berserk! The cunts are beating 'n kicking everything that moves! They don't care about order, methinks, they're just beating 'n kicking for the sake of beating and kicking.]]></string>
<string id="538274"><![CDATA[They do as governor Saburov orders them to.]]></string>
<string id="538275"><![CDATA[Aye, you go ahead 'n find the bloke they are obeying! When they go to The Rod to do their reporting, they're obeying all right, but out on duty they only care for their free-for-all. 'N taking bribes, too!]]></string>
<string id="538276"><![CDATA[Bribes? For what?]]></string>
<string id="538277"><![CDATA[Look, here: they got pills, right? Right. That's point one. They beat us lot dead for nothing, right? Right. That's point two. 'N if any of us wants to go here or there? There goes point three...]]></string>
<string id="538278"><![CDATA[Are they letting the infected out of their designated areas?]]></string>
<string id="538279"><![CDATA[Aye, and why not if the sum's hefty? Use your big-city brains, big-city man! You take a look at them, looking good, honest 'n all, standing there risking their lives. But if you take a closer look, they're all muggers 'n bloodsuckers, all of 'em! We know them, they're the same as us—people of the Steppe, working people... Not your head-in-the-clouds type.]]></string>
<string id="538280"><![CDATA[Are you aware of any particular incidents? Has anyone been caught red-handed?]]></string>
<string id="538281"><![CDATA[Ha ha ha... Caught? Nay, that's not how it works! I was just saying that they know no limits. Same killers, just wearing uniforms, that's what they are. Unfairness is an ingrained part of human nature. Can't hide that under a uniform.]]></string>
<string id="538282"><![CDATA[I believe the patrolmen are honest people.]]></string>
<string id="538283"><![CDATA[That's true.]]></string>
<string id="538284"><![CDATA[If I find out that they're conniving at breaking the quarantine, they're dead.]]></string>
<string id="538285"><![CDATA[You go talk to the governor, make him let us beat 'em if we catch 'em stealing or extorting!]]></string>
<string id="538286"><![CDATA[That is not an option. You will use it as an excuse to beat them for any reason.]]></string>
<string id="538287"><![CDATA[They have volunteer immunity.]]></string>
<string id="538288"><![CDATA[Stop whining, they are doing everything they can.]]></string>
<string id="538289"><![CDATA[You're right! So give them what they deserve!]]></string>
<string id="538290"><![CDATA[The patrols maintain order in the streets. They are a necessary evil.]]></string>
<string id="538291"><![CDATA[Why are you proletarians outside? Aren't you scared of the infection? ]]></string>
<string id="538292"><![CDATA[Rumour has it the Termitary is all dandy and shiny now... How's that? Do they know a remedy or something?]]></string>
<string id="538293"><![CDATA[Why are you so sure? ]]></string>
<string id="538294"><![CDATA[The commandant of the Termitary, Tycheek, had a daughter. When she returned, they all cared for her as if she was a pretty little doll! Sugary sweet. And followed her words, too… She's a smart one though, no fooling 'round—she only talked sense… ]]></string>
<string id="538295"><![CDATA[What does the commandant's daughter have to do with this?]]></string>
<string id="538296"><![CDATA[The little dove must have saved them! They humoured the lil' weakling, nurtured her like a lil' baby dove, they were all aflutter… 'N so they were rewarded! They can't all be beastworms, methinks. Got a soul in them too…]]></string>
<string id="538297"><![CDATA[Life takes different forms.]]></string>
<string id="538298"><![CDATA[I shall get in there sooner or later! ]]></string>
<string id="538299"><![CDATA[They followed her words? ]]></string>
<string id="538300"><![CDATA[That they did—she only needed say a single word, and it'd all be done! She wouldn't even finish what she'd be saying, and it'd all be done anyway. She could tell 'em to burn water—and they would. But she's a smart lil' lass, she's not abusing it… ]]></string>
<string id="538301"><![CDATA[So you think she told them not to be sick—and now they aren't?]]></string>
<string id="538302"><![CDATA[Says who?]]></string>
<string id="538303"><![CDATA[Wenches do… They're all in league with one another, the folk inside, I mean… As for the meat thrown out of the windows and the bloody rags, that's all smoke and mirrors, they say, so that no one would try to get inside…]]></string>
<string id="538304"><![CDATA[And the rags are just dyed, right?]]></string>
<string id="538305"><![CDATA[Dunno, it can all be idle gossip… But them wenches say 'tis all fine there… ]]></string>
<string id="538306"><![CDATA[And you're all too eager to repeat after them…]]></string>
<string id="538307"><![CDATA[I wish it were.]]></string>
<string id="538308"><![CDATA[Tell me, why is the slaughterhouse here top secret?]]></string>
<string id="538309"><![CDATA[Well, er… 'tis been like that since olden times! It's one whale of a building, see? Ancient, too. It was built even before men came here, before the glaciers came, too. It was a place of rite… they used to feed the earth there. She's the foundation of every birth and burst, she's the mother. Her depths are endless... ]]></string>
<string id="538310"><![CDATA[So? What does it have to do with the Abattoir?]]></string>
<string id="538311"><![CDATA[They've been dealing in bulls here since times immemorial, too. And bull rites are complicated—a bull is not a common beast, he's the baby child of Mother Steppe! He deserves respect. So they've built this giant temple. For the rite.]]></string>
<string id="538312"><![CDATA[So it's a ceremonial construction? Is it a place of worship still?]]></string>
<string id="538313"><![CDATA[A cere-what-tion...? Worship, yeah, they do worship bulls still. The cut them by the rite, bury them by the rite—we factory men only get like half the meat. Where does the rest go? To the rite! Vlad the owner respects 'em, so they respect him back and fulfill the quota.]]></string>
<string id="538314"><![CDATA[You savages… this is ridiculously backwards!]]></string>
<string id="538315"><![CDATA[So they've got a mutual agreement? Right... ]]></string>
<string id="538316"><![CDATA[What kind of rite? ]]></string>
<string id="538317"><![CDATA[The proper one… They bring him bull in with a song, thank him, clean him, honour him; draw things on him, too. Then they butcher him quietly and respectfully. When they're carving him, it's like children playing—this piece goes here, that one goes there, one for the warmth, one for the harvest...]]></string>
<string id="538318"><![CDATA[Have you seen it yourself? ]]></string>
<string id="538319"><![CDATA[No... Like I would be allowed to…]]></string>
<string id="538320"><![CDATA[You savages… this is ridiculously backwards!]]></string>
<string id="538321"><![CDATA[So that's all idle fairytales then.]]></string>
<string id="538322"><![CDATA[You seem to be far from desperate.]]></string>
<string id="538323"><![CDATA[Well yeah... The sanitary train is arriving soon, they say. It'll bring medicine and take the sick away to be cured. If only we could last till it comes… And when does it come, I wonder?]]></string>
<string id="538324"><![CDATA[Yeah, in your dreams.]]></string>
<string id="538325"><![CDATA[We were told it would come, so it will. Doctors will come bringing drops and poultices. They'll help everyone. I hope they'll be here in time to save the sick! Their fortune ain't all that shiny otherwise—they are goners in five hours without them pills… ]]></string>
<string id="538326"><![CDATA[Their supply is short. You will get neither drops nor poultices anyway.]]></string>
<string id="538327"><![CDATA[Of couse I will, everyone will. The Powers That Be got it all figured out. And if the population's lower, that means we're on the safe side. Got more than enough.]]></string>
<string id="538328"><![CDATA[Well, we shall hope.]]></string>
<string id="538329"><![CDATA[Pray that they manage to save one tenth of the population.]]></string>
<string id="538330"><![CDATA[Just don't trample one another when it arrives. ]]></string>
<string id="538331"><![CDATA[Soon, pop. There will be a train for all of you soon.]]></string>
<string id="538332"><![CDATA[What do you say, oh wise old man? ]]></string>
<string id="538333"><![CDATA[Fall, fall all around! It's all the fall's fault… Fall means crud, crud 'n ungliness. Last year my good-mother's rooster died, the year before that I got myself a cold back. And cattle won't come… Fall ain't good for your condition.]]></string>
<string id="538334"><![CDATA[About the cattle… How is this business organized here? ]]></string>
<string id="538335"><![CDATA[They are brought from the Steppe. Bulls won't come on their own, they're pampered creatures. You gotta know your way around a bull. The herdsmen, the odonghs, go after them. And then they bring them back… Some of them bring a single beast, others—a dozen or even a hundred... then we nurture them here...]]></string>
<string id="538336"><![CDATA[Has anyone seen dead animals around here recently? ]]></string>
<string id="538337"><![CDATA[No, no! They do not die. If it's all Sand Pest, not a single bull will die of it. When was it...? Oh yeah, five years ago! None of the bulls died too. And I don't think anyone was sick among those who look after 'em.]]></string>
<string id="538338"><![CDATA[So bulls do get sick, but they don't die?]]></string>
<string id="538339"><![CDATA[This is not my business, really... I've no idea if they get sick or not—all I know is there was no plague among them. And their caretakers were fine too… No, no, it couldn't have come from them. It couldn't. The hides, the meat… who works it all? We do. So I know what I'm talking about.]]></string>
<string id="538340"><![CDATA[I concur—doesn't seem like it comes from bulls. But the coincidence is weird… ]]></string>
<string id="538341"><![CDATA[Oh blessed innocence... I wish I was so sure.]]></string>
<string id="538342"><![CDATA[Are they immune?]]></string>
<string id="538343"><![CDATA[Why don't you breed them here? ]]></string>
<string id="538344"><![CDATA[Well, that ain't the right thing to do… that would go against their custom. So what? Our job is canning meat. They can breed 'em however they like. Perhaps there is a pasture of theirs deep in the Steppe—and that's where they come from.]]></string>
<string id="538345"><![CDATA[So do bulls die?]]></string>
<string id="538346"><![CDATA[A stunning syllogism… You should follow my instructions rather than getting engaged in philosophical speculation about health. Your lot is supposed to stay in!]]></string>
<string id="538347"><![CDATA[Why do you all keep wandering about! Or are the deliveries irregular? ]]></string>
<string id="538348"><![CDATA[Oi, mate, mate! Stop. Gotta talk to you. Smoke?]]></string>
<string id="538349"><![CDATA[No thank you. What do you want to talk about?]]></string>
<string id="538350"><![CDATA[Recently I heard that the factory workers are supposed to get free boots... or something? To get the pest off their feet, 'cause it comes through them feet! Well hey, I'm a factory man, I can fashion myself a passport too if you want. My good-father is a factory man too, 'n my good sister is eligible for them benefits too, her being big with child 'n all...]]></string>
<string id="538351"><![CDATA[Stop gabbling! What boots?]]></string>
<string id="538352"><![CDATA[Protective boots! So that the disease wouldn't infiltrate them feet along with all kinds of dampness 'n all. They say they help—the shoes or boots or whatever, y'know, those rough ones. And you don't even have to take them pills—cause their prices bite… How much does a single one cost?

Attention all citizens! Following the outbreak of a lethal disease commonly known as "Sand Plague", "Sand Pest", and "Sand Dirt", the town authorities hereby declare state of emergency.

The disease is extremely contagious. There is still ongoing research as to how the disease is transmitted, but cases of contact and droplet infection have been confirmed. There are currently no vaccine solutions in the town and none are to be expected before the regular train arrives. Please be extra careful!

The townspeople are forbidden to leave their homes unless under special instruction. Remember: the possibility of infection is much lower for those who stay indoors. The citizens are advised to sterilise their household wares, boil their clothing, and exterminate as many vermin as possible.

Do not panic! Medics, couriers and executors will take care of mail delivery, as well as the distribution of drinking water, provisions and medicine. Requests should be written down and slid under the door for couriers to collect.

This address was composed on the instructions of Bachelor Dankovsky and ratified by the State of Emergency Town Governor Alexander Saburov. It is compulsory to follow every advice herein.]]></string>
<string id="538398"><![CDATA[EPIDEMIC (Written on Your Recommendation; Sent for Approval)]]></string>
<string id="538399"><![CDATA[The Annotation for Patrolmen, Couriers, Executors and Sanitary Personnel

In order to prevent panic, this annotation is classified and its contents should be under no circumstances disclosed to the civilian population.

The disease is incurable. There is no vaccine, neither here nor in the Capital. However, there are a few positive facts:

1. The probability of contracting the disease is significantly lower for someone who has taken immune system stimulants. As of now we believe that A-pills and B-pills (yellow coloured and blue coloured pills, respectively) provide the best protective effect. Excessive doses of these medicants may be detrimental to one's health.

2. Additional protection is afforded by synthetic clothing. Woolen garments are strictly off limits (parasites). The clothing should be changed as often as possible.

3. IMPORTANT! The disease develops sporadically. At its initial stage, it does not progress in any significant way, especially if antibiotics are taken. However, if contact with the infection reoccurs, the development of the disease becomes extremely rapid.

4. The disease is not transmitted by means of droplet infection. As of now, we've yet to find out how it is contracted. Preliminary tests suggest that the disease is not contagious at early stages, therefore there is no need to isolate the sick person immediately after the appearance of the symptoms.

App. The Executors:

In consideration of your particular line of work, we believe that you will not be able to avoid infection. If you have contracted the disease, do not give in to despair. It would have happened sooner or later anyway. Try your best to conserve the infection at its initial stage. Take antibiotic medicine. Consider using the "shmowders": they are extremely dangerous, but they help curb the infection.]]></string>
<string id="538400"><![CDATA[CONFIDENTIAL NOTATION (Written on Your Recommendation; Sent for Approval)]]></string>
<string id="538401"><![CDATA[The following sanitary precautions are hereby announced:

There are citizens—so-called "Bound"—who seem to be extraordinarily involved in town happenings. They are regularly contacted by people of different lines of occupation and social standing, including your two colleagues. They also try to compensate what they believe to be your inaction with their own efforts. In consideration of that, the Executor Committee has decided:

1. If a Bound person falls ill, the door to their home should be guarded by an Executor.

2. While the Bound person remains conscious, the Executor should collect mail deliveries from them and pass over to them the provisions and medicaments delivered by the couriers.

3. In exceptional cases it is allowed to visit the patient. To enable communication with the Bound person, the Executor should resort to higher efficiency antibiotic medicine (feromycinum).

4. Vaccines, serums, and other such solutions should be administered, if available, in the same manner as all of the above.

<string id="538403"><![CDATA[The time has come. She is calling for you. If our hopes come true, the new Mistress will return to the town, and in so doing, signify the end of the pestilence.

We put our trust in you. We love you.

<string id="538404"><![CDATA[Invitation from the Kains ]]></string>
<string id="538405"><![CDATA[The truth reveals itself to me, oynon. I have claimed my father's grievous inheritance. I have made my choice.

I believe that the settlement can be saved. It is alive. The Kin still lives, even though my father, who was destined to lead it, has died. The Kin is nourished and sustained by the earth. The earth that knows how to breathe. A new harvest may be nurtured here.

I devote my life to service of the Kin, just as the lines of my family enjoin me to. I will change this town; it will be reborn to live anew. Victoria Olgimskaya, the White Mistress, will breathe life into it. The fallen families will be replaced by those marked by the sign of the spirits. Children they are, Taya Tycheek, Chieftain Notkin, blessed Grace, urchins Murky and Sticky, and, possibly, one more whom I did not yet get to meet. He goes by the name of Khan.

If they survive—so will the town. If you want the town to live, just like I do, then help me, or at least don't interfere with my actions. Woe is you if any one of the children dies. For they are meant to inherit the earth.

<string id="538426"><![CDATA[Yes, I've heard about Mistresses. ]]></string>
<string id="538427"><![CDATA[We're not sure if we ought to be happy or sad. The joy could not be greater if she were to become a mother, for today a wondrous creature will be born. But the sorrow is also great. Maria is leaving. We used to have a beloved daughter—and today we're going to lose her.]]></string>
<string id="538428"><![CDATA[She wanted to talk to me, didn't she? ]]></string>
<string id="538429"><![CDATA[It's too late now. Maria is unconscious. Her latest fit came last night. She came to for a brief while—and then fell back into the depths. She will wake up soon. And I believe my daughter will be able to rise from the depths to which she descended.]]></string>
<string id="538430"><![CDATA[Why did she summon me? ]]></string>
<string id="538431"><![CDATA[There used to be three powers in our town. They may not exist anymore, but they have left offshoots. Two more heiresses will become Mistresses when their time comes. One is Capella, Victoria's daughter. I don't know who the other one is. It may be Saburova's successor, but it's not Clara. Clara is pure.]]></string>
<string id="538432"><![CDATA[No. Tell me. ]]></string>
<string id="538433"><![CDATA[You've written that the coming of a Mistress will stop the pestilence. Why? ]]></string>
<string id="538434"><![CDATA[It won't stop it. It will herald it. You will be the one to stop the pestilence, Bachelor Dankovsky. Your path and Maria's run parallel for now—and close to each other, too. One thing I know for sure: when a Mistress comes, the filth will be gone from our lives. They're incompatible.]]></string>
<string id="538435"><![CDATA[A Mistress grants life to anything she touches with her hand, her words, or even her thoughts. Like that ancient king who turned bread, trees, and water into gold with a touch of his hand. But the king's touch turned the living into the dead. A Mistress does the opposite.]]></string>
<string id="538436"><![CDATA[How does it work?]]></string>
<string id="538437"><![CDATA[That I do not know. I know that it happens, and know that there is no greater joy in the world. A Mistress can hold a toy in her hands, and it will come to life. She can think about it, and the doll will remember its family history to the seventh generation. She can see it in a dream—and the doll will be able to create.]]></string>
<string id="538438"><![CDATA[I see. ]]></string>
<string id="538439"><![CDATA[And Maria is becoming one of such women?]]></string>

<string id="538443"><![CDATA[Who are these future Mistresses? ]]></string>
<string id="538444"><![CDATA[The Saburovs had no other successor. Why are you so sure it isn't Clara? ]]></string>
<string id="538445"><![CDATA[Because Clara was here a while ago. She looked me in the eye—and I can tell good from evil all right! No, she is not the Mistress of Earth. She may very well be a true saint. But I can feel where the real Mistress of the Earth is now. She's hiding somewhere in the Termitary.]]></string>
<string id="538446"><![CDATA[All right. Is there something you want me to tell them?]]></string>
<string id="538447"><![CDATA[I'll gladly do it for her.]]></string>
<string id="538448"><![CDATA[Quite probably. He's the type to get into trouble, you know…]]></string>
<string id="538449"><![CDATA[If so, then what are you waiting for? Win him back, help him—and he will tell you something that will turn your worldview upside down. You won't need his blueprints afterwards.]]></string>

<string id="538451"><![CDATA[Do you have the blueprints for the Polyhedron? I've seen papers on the table over there... ]]></string>
<string id="538452"><![CDATA[I am indeed powerless, as you can see. I'm accused of having arranged your discovery. I've lost my vote of confidence. So tell them whose discovery it is—for the laurels are yours. Are you in doubt?]]></string>

<string id="538454"><![CDATA[Yes. It's a phenomenon beyond the habitual reality, contradicting the laws of common sense and embodying that which mustn't be known to, felt, and seen by men. And yet it has been created and materialized at human discretion.]]></string>

<string id="538457"><![CDATA[Indeed.]]></string>
<string id="538458"><![CDATA[However, somehow they never seem to live too long. Now, at the dawn of the current century, there are almost none left. One gets the impression that there is no contry that would imbue its inhabitants with inner force simply because they happen to inhabit it. There have been examples of this, but they've all been destroyed. Why?]]></string>
<string id="538459"><![CDATA[I do not know.]]></string>
<string id="538460"><![CDATA[Let's get back to the matter at hand. A wonderful town is suddenly beginning to die. No one knows why. Why this one—the one that has managed to produce a wonder? The most curious, the most mysterious, inhabited by the most talented people? What did they do to deserve this? I'll tell you.]]></string>
<string id="538461"><![CDATA[I'm all ears. ]]></string>
<string id="538462"><![CDATA[At the persistent pleasure of the caprisious Powers That Be, the Miracle that has been accidentally embodied as the Polyhedron is forced to stay there, captured by the flesh of the town that has nurtured it, feeding it with its resources, people, and hot blood.

<string id="538464"><![CDATA[Enslaved miracles die not out of anyone's malice—that is just their nature. You can't hold a miracle with your hands, you can only hold its corpse. The idea is not new. Let us have a closer look at the Disease, the imbodiment of this logic. Is it good or evil? Why has it come to the Town?]]></string>
<string id="538465"><![CDATA[It's obviously evil. ]]></string>
<string id="538466"><![CDATA[Why did you come to the town at the same time then? You are by all definitions a hero. A miracle-maker almost. It was the Powers That Be that have tried to make you detain a miracle here… not the poor obsessed Kains. They've only played their part. They represent their own force. But you... do you really want to go back to being a slave? The Powers That Be are bending you to submission according to their own design!]]></string>
<string id="538467"><![CDATA[You are obsessed with revenge, Aglaya. Revenge is a bad companion in the search for the truth. ]]></string>
<string id="538468"><![CDATA[In this case they are. It's strange that you have failed to see that. This place is a utopia—that is, an abuse of nature. The Utopia must be destroyed. It's evil.]]></string>

<string id="538475"><![CDATA[I already know what you're about to say.]]></string>
<string id="538476"><![CDATA[Yes, I realize this… Who knows how many years will pass before I come into power? Very many, perhaps… And the only thing left for me will be taking up residence in the town Maria will have built and accepting the place she will have appointed to me… if there is one. So it cannot be changed now, can it?]]></string>
<string id="538477"><![CDATA[It can't.]]></string>
<string id="538478"><![CDATA[Well... I was so close… But the town is better off with a Dark Mistress than with none at all. We cannot stall any longer. Especially since "dark" doesn't really mean "evil". And Nina wasn't a Dark Mistress, she was the Mistress of the Night. They even called her Scarlet. Scarlet Nina, Scarlet Maria.]]></string>

<string id="538495"><![CDATA[Not at all. They know what they're getting into. It's horrible, yes… but it also happens at their own request. No one's forcing their hand—and we're offering sizable compensations to the testers' families. It's a fortune for a poor worker.]]></string>

<string id="538499"><![CDATA[You are not wrong here... Still, I'd rather go with my own assumptions. Not unlike yourself, I base my speculations on rigorous research, even though it may not look veritable enough to you.

<string id="538503"><![CDATA[...and she said, "I made a mistake, for I wanted to do the right thing, but instead I have lost my gifts, exhausted my powers and dissolved into the crowd of simple people. I need to go into hiding now, to avoid their false accusations. An alarm bell can be seen from the window of the house where I find shelter. The air is glowing-hot all around it. Before long it will toll heavily over Gorkhon."]]></string>
<string id="538504"><![CDATA[She spoke to me in a dream...]]></string>
<string id="538505"><![CDATA[...looking scared and miserable. She said, "They persecute me, they hunt me, they try to track me down. They are so close to capturing me that I had to change my hideout four times in a single day. I am covering up here, at the brink of the town, where they won't find me so easily. From the windows I see two bonfires being lit—are they trying to smoke me out? Are they going to put a watcher atop the ruined stairway surrounded by columns?"]]></string>
<string id="538506"><![CDATA[She appeared before me in a dream...]]></string>
<string id="538507"><![CDATA[...and although she was covering her face with her hands, I saw that her lips were oozing blood. I saw blood trickling from beneath her eyelids and glittering in the cracks of her dessicated palms.

I heard her mumble through her fingers, "This is not the crowd that seeks me now, not these mindlessly fervent people I came to love so much, not them, but two demons, two destroyers, armed to their teeth and devoid of human compassion! They hate me even more than they loathe each other, they want nothing more than my death."

"...They will capture me, make me an object of trade, they will pay generously in silver and blood to learn where I am and tear me limb from limb. The names of the demons are Artemy, spawned by the Heat of the Earth, and Daniil, begotten by the cold Celestial Flame..."

"...from my window I saw each one of them bring a butcher down within the flaming Suok Ring. They are fighting each other now, but neither will win the fight..."]]></string>
<string id="538508"><![CDATA[I saw her in a dream once again...]]></string>
<string id="538509"><![CDATA[...saying, "Who has betrayed me? Who has led them to my hiding place? Would I have known where to conceal myself next, were it not for the warning of my faithfuls who brought me inside? For my enemies gathered everyone they could and surrounded my shelter. Would I have escaped were it not for my miraculous powers?"

"...In that three-sided yard, my faithfuls saw me from high above and set out to rescue me, protect me and give me shelter. For they have witnessed the miracles I have shown them and were convinced by my righteous deeds..."]]></string>
<string id="538510"><![CDATA[As I woke up, I heard her voice...]]></string>
<string id="538511"><![CDATA[...she was all tortured and torn. All she did was look at me; she didn't say a word this time. She was hiding in the house yet again, cowering in the corner, away from the windows. The crowd was roaring outside. They shouted, they made all manner of racket... but this time it wasn't her they were after.

They were celebrating the arrival of the bull that appeared unexpectedly in the middle of an empty lot. Some of them screamed that the Bos has risen from beneath the ground. The others shouted that it came down from heaven only to be pierced by the stake that was prepared for it down below.]]></string>
<string id="538512"><![CDATA[I dreamt of her tonight, just like the night before...]]></string>
<string id="538513"><![CDATA[...for as soon as my eyes were shut she appeared before me. "They have betrayed me," she said, "My faithfuls have given me up. I only have you now, my soul, my inseparable connection..."
"...I would have asked you to join me, but I have no notion of where my feet have taken me. Frightened, I fled the Theatre. I ran down the stairs and came to a place which seemed hard to stumble upon. I concealed myself there, in a small house between the two larger ones... There is no way I can come near the windows, and there is no one here to answer my cries..."
"...Find me, come visit me and comfort me. In return I will comfort you..."]]></string>
<string id="538514"><![CDATA[It was just as if she was waiting for me...]]></string>
<string id="538515"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="538516"><![CDATA[Being here is such a torment... this place is cold, gloomy, full of pain, and worst of all, devoid of the slightest warmth or comfort... How can anyone be made to suffer this for so long? Why did you do this to us? Why don't you just resolve everything already, so we could be out of here?]]></string>
<string id="538517"><![CDATA[…Who are you?]]></string>
<string id="538518"><![CDATA[So I've found you at last... sister!]]></string>
<string id="538519"><![CDATA[I'm no sister of yours! Do you really not recognize me?]]></string>
<string id="538520"><![CDATA[What, you're my conscience?]]></string>
<string id="538521"><![CDATA[No. I don't recognize you.]]></string>
<string id="538522"><![CDATA[I must be dreaming this... No, I'm not. So you're real?]]></string>
<string id="538523"><![CDATA[I'm a real person all right. The real person.]]></string>
<string id="538524"><![CDATA[I'm the one dreaming you... sister. You can't exist! Do you understand that?]]></string>
<string id="538525"><![CDATA[Then we should part ways quickly before something bad happens... Except I don't want to let you go! Even though I'm afraid to touch you—I feel sorry for you... and hence I love you, my dear sister—maybe more than any living being on this earth!]]></string>
<string id="538526"><![CDATA[I love you too!]]></string>
<string id="538527"><![CDATA[And I hate you!]]></string>
<string id="538528"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="538529"><![CDATA[You're so sweet; such eyes... They're not like mine at all.]]></string>
<string id="538535"><![CDATA[And I've been missing you so much…]]></string>
<string id="538536"><![CDATA[Our hands don't look the same either…]]></string>
<string id="538538"><![CDATA[You need to leave at once! See, the whole place is infected!]]></string>
<string id="538539"><![CDATA[You know as well as I do that the infection won't do anything to me. I can't go anywhere now—I'm now hated by those who used to love me. They torture me; they burn me and hurl stones at me... I have to hide…]]></string>
<string id="538540"><![CDATA[Why is it that any place you visit becomes infected?]]></string>
<string id="538541"><![CDATA[Go away regardless. I'm asking kindly.]]></string>
<string id="538542"><![CDATA[See, everything's already dead in here. While elsewhere there are people waiting for you.]]></string>
<string id="538543"><![CDATA[No, I'm not going anywhere, dear sister... I'm staying here. I feel better here. Back there, I'm not needed.]]></string>
<string id="538544"><![CDATA[Yes. That's true. I know that there's another place, where the air is still healthy, and where my faithful are waiting for me. They miss me... I'm leaving tonight, to seek refuge with them.]]></string>
<string id="538545"><![CDATA[Oh, how is that my fault? I come here because I need a place to hide from those who are out there hunting me. They've got fire and steel, their henchmen are ferocious—and what do I have to stave them off with? Only this... They're too scared to get closer... Those who've remained faithful to me can't do anything to protect me. ]]></string>
<string id="538546"><![CDATA[Yes. I'm quite fond of the Kains. ]]></string>
<string id="538547"><![CDATA[The Kains will help us—if they are still capable of anything at all, that is—to gather the necessary documents concerning that unusual structure, the Polyhedron.]]></string>
<string id="538548"><![CDATA[Why do you need those documents?]]></string>
<string id="538549"><![CDATA[Are you joking? How am I supposed to work without documents? Firstly, I need to draw up a so-called "Inquisitor's argument", which will contain documental evidence providing the rationale for my decision. There could be a Tribunal... and it's not something to be trifled with.]]></string>
<string id="538550"><![CDATA[And secondly…? ]]></string>
<string id="538551"><![CDATA[And secondly, that blasted Block turned out to be not as dimwitted as I expected. He's taking advantage of my youth and weakness and has decided to ascertain the validity of my decisions himself! Without having a shred of understanding, of course! And of course doubting me from the start.]]></string>
<string id="538552"><![CDATA[Very well. What documents do you need?]]></string>
<string id="538553"><![CDATA[Basically, I need to know what that structure is. I need all documents pertaining to that building. There is probably a connection between its fantastic form and the fantastic events that have taken place.]]></string>
<string id="538554"><![CDATA[That's out of the question. From what I know about the author, he doesn't have much time left. A wild lifestyle, heightened anxiety, alcohol and hallucinogen addiction, obsessive phobias, remarkably intensive neural stress…]]></string>
<string id="538555"><![CDATA[And yet you were implying something else when mentioning his short life span…]]></string>
<string id="538556"><![CDATA[What? No. As you are probably aware, yesterday I took that young man under my protection and averted a threat to him… Admittedly, I also implied that people like him are always in danger. Always. Tell me, how long have you known… that man?]]></string>
<string id="538557"><![CDATA[Not that long. Do you have some… less than apparent information about him?]]></string>
<string id="538558"><![CDATA[Spot on. On the other hand, Peter is still quite young. He is of the same age as me.]]></string>
<string id="538559"><![CDATA[We've made acquaintance quite some time ago.]]></string>
<string id="538560"><![CDATA[Has he ever told you of the similarities the two of you bear? That you could end up in a position similar to his—and vice versa? That being an inevitable victim of circumstance is the only fate available to a genius? I ask you to be precise. A lot of things hinge on your answer.]]></string>
<string id="538561"><![CDATA[That was a disturbing question… No. He never said that.]]></string>
<string id="538562"><![CDATA[His brother and I were peers… back when we were in university.]]></string>
<string id="538563"><![CDATA[Perhaps. Even if he didn't say those precise words, he certainly could have.]]></string>
<string id="538564"><![CDATA[I was hoping you would explain that to me.]]></string>
<string id="538567"><![CDATA[Everything is in plain sight—it doesn't require a thorough study to see…]]></string>
<string id="538568"><![CDATA[If you're talking about the disease, then I'll have you know that the Tower is clean. I confirmed that there's no infection.]]></string>
<string id="538569"><![CDATA[Of course, of course… I'm sure it is. That's the first thing I checked out as well… It's squeaky clean.]]></string>
<string id="538570"><![CDATA[No, it's not. I need more time.]]></string>
<string id="538571"><![CDATA[Why do you ask? ]]></string>
<string id="538572"><![CDATA[No. ]]></string>
<string id="538573"><![CDATA[Because they are obviously very fond of you. Maria is in love with you, that's clear as day—even though it makes no sense if my knowledge of her future plans is correct. Victor has gone so far as to entrust you with some final family matter. Georgiy speaks of you with great sympathy.]]></string>
<string id="538574"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="538575"><![CDATA[What is it? Why are you here? Look how thin my hands have become…]]></string>
<string id="538576"><![CDATA[I want to talk to you…]]></string>
<string id="538577"><![CDATA[It's too late! How am I to talk to you now? Look for me in another place now, not far from here... They've killed me. I've been banished.]]></string>
<string id="538578"><![CDATA[But how am I going to find you?]]></string>
<string id="538579"><![CDATA[Go to sleep. Put a copper coin on each eye…]]></string>
<string id="538580"><![CDATA[I'll soon go to sleep forever…]]></string>
<string id="538581"><![CDATA[Indeed…]]></string>
<string id="538582"><![CDATA[They're no thinner than mine, sister.]]></string>
<string id="538583"><![CDATA[Killed you? You're no more dead than I am. And I am here talking to you…]]></string>
<string id="538584"><![CDATA[I don't have any copper coins on me…]]></string>
<string id="538585"><![CDATA[Go away.]]></string>
<string id="538586"><![CDATA[Who are those faithful?]]></string>
<string id="538587"><![CDATA[You have adherents?]]></string>
<string id="538588"><![CDATA[Simple folk; commoners, outcasts, non-Bounds. But they've been unafraid of him who's been my only friend all this time, him who's taken the blow for me. They're taking care of him—of this absurd and impossible creature, a living thing made of dead matter. They didn't turn him into a scapegoat for all their sins and murders!]]></string>
<string id="538589"><![CDATA[It will be better that way, sister…]]></string>
<string id="538590"><![CDATA[I know who you're talking about. It's that albino. The creature from the Steppe.]]></string>
<string id="538591"><![CDATA[It's a shabnak-adyr, moulded from bones and clay!]]></string>
<string id="538592"><![CDATA[All right then... Stay here. Don't go anywhere.]]></string>
<string id="538593"><![CDATA[Yes you are. People love you. They think you're a saint.]]></string>

<string id="538598"><![CDATA[I just wanted to tell you about the Changeling...]]></string>
<string id="538599"><![CDATA[We've already sheltered the harbinger… Her persecutors won't have her... Do not get in our way... we are leaving...]]></string>
<string id="538600"><![CDATA[So I am late!]]></string>
<string id="538601"><![CDATA[I'll find you tomorrow... that is to say, today.]]></string>
<string id="538602"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="538603"><![CDATA[We have been waiting for you... harbinger... We believe you... As do many others... I'll gather the rest...]]></string>
<string id="538604"><![CDATA[Yes. I am the harbinger.]]></string>
<string id="538605"><![CDATA[You have been waiting for the Changeling! She is not the one whom you want to serve! Go away from here and never give her shelter!]]></string>
<string id="538606"><![CDATA[...Where shall I take you?]]></string>
<string id="538607"><![CDATA[Take me to any shelter.]]></string>

<string id="538609"><![CDATA[I am the true Clara.]]></string>
<string id="538610"><![CDATA[Well, now... Let us go... Show us your miracle, give us your blessing so that our set-up is never discovered and we are not attacked on the way… Bless our feet, harbinger…]]></string>
<string id="538611"><![CDATA[An evil demon is hunting my sister—he's sending the pest after her! If you offer her shelter, the disease will be here tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="538612"><![CDATA[We are not afraid.]]></string>
<string id="538613"><![CDATA[Show us your miracle... Then we'll believe you... and tell the others about who you really are... And they will believe in you too…]]></string>
<string id="538614"><![CDATA[Go away from here! Or else I—the real me—will lay a curse on you.]]></string>
<string id="538615"><![CDATA[By the power granted to me from above I tell you this: go. You don't need the harbinger.]]></string>
<string id="538616"><![CDATA[Go away from here! Or you will be punished tomorrow. The plague is after me…]]></string>
<string id="538617"><![CDATA[Here it is. Go ahead and run away when you know I was in the right.]]></string>
<string id="538618"><![CDATA[Here it is. Go ahead and run away when you know I was in the right.]]></string>
<string id="538619"><![CDATA[No... I'm afraid to. It will drain too much of my power. I think I may even die.]]></string>
<string id="538620"><![CDATA[It's beyond my power... One cannot work miracles just to prove they are in the right. The punishment will be awful.]]></string>
<string id="538621"><![CDATA[What are you…? I keep trying to remember... You are like that for a reason!]]></string>
<string id="538622"><![CDATA[You are the Changeling... We knew someone would come to tempt us...]]></string>
<string id="538623"><![CDATA[This is the punishment for my impertinence—I dared use my gift for personal gain!]]></string>
<string id="538624"><![CDATA[I want to try again...]]></string>
<string id="538625"><![CDATA[Now I see that it really is you... So what you're saying is somebody will appear under your guise and bring us plague?]]></string>
<string id="538626"><![CDATA[Yes. You have to go.]]></string>
<string id="538627"><![CDATA[Drive her away!]]></string>
<string id="538628"><![CDATA[We'll wait for her and make her leave this neighbourhood... Tomorrow this district will be clean...]]></string>
<string id="538629"><![CDATA[Let it be so...]]></string>
<string id="538630"><![CDATA[Be firm. Drive her away even if she cures someone on front of you!]]></string>
<string id="538631"><![CDATA[I have proof that I'm not who I've been mistaken for! I've performed a miracle.]]></string>
<string id="538632"><![CDATA[What miracle have you performed?]]></string>
<string id="538633"><![CDATA[Yesterday I cleansed the Atrium district—the one that borders on the Cathedral! Go and see for yourself.]]></string>
<string id="538634"><![CDATA[Today I banished the disease from the Spleen district. You can check—it will be clean tomorrow!]]></string>
<string id="538635"><![CDATA[Hm... That could be a simple coincidence.]]></string>
<string id="538636"><![CDATA[Indeed? Meanwhile the information I've got is that the disease is rampant in the Kidneys. What will happen tomorrow? Tomorrow it will be clean, I'm sure. According to the Bachelor, the disease burns out in the space of a day.]]></string>
<string id="538637"><![CDATA[Your Bachelor knows nothing! It doesn't burn out of its own accord, I can assure you! If I didn't do it, the disease would still be there tomorrow.]]></string>
<string id="538638"><![CDATA[So you don't believe me?]]></string>
<string id="538639"><![CDATA[So you don't believe me?]]></string>
<string id="538640"><![CDATA[This information needs to be thoroughly checked. If it is indeed the way you describe it, and you're capable of cleansing districts one at a time... I suppose I might even reward you for such feats.]]></string>
<string id="538641"><![CDATA[Test me! You'll see that I'm telling the truth.]]></string>
<string id="538642"><![CDATA[I've cleansed the Spleen district. Are you convinced now?]]></string>
<string id="538643"><![CDATA[Maybe, maybe... So you think that if not for you, that district would still be infected now?]]></string>
<string id="538644"><![CDATA[Doubtlessly.]]></string>
<string id="538645"><![CDATA[It all depends on who's been to that district.]]></string>
<string id="538646"><![CDATA[You're a clever little girl... I'll give you that. Well then, carry on with your work. Collect the reward you've been promised. And make sure you remember our deal…]]></string>
<string id="538647"><![CDATA[I do remember it.]]></string>
<string id="538648"><![CDATA[Our deal? What deal?]]></string>
<string id="538649"><![CDATA[I've cleansed the Crude Sprawl. You can see for yourself. It's clean.]]></string>
<string id="538650"><![CDATA[Well done, my girl. Here, let me look into your eyes…]]></string>
<string id="538651"><![CDATA[Look.]]></string>
<string id="538652"><![CDATA[If you're not afraid…]]></string>
<string id="538653"><![CDATA[Nothing... Except... I've cleansed the Skinner district.]]></string>
<string id="538654"><![CDATA[Very well. I will relay your words to her.]]></string>
<string id="538655"><![CDATA[So what, am I supposed to become one of your Kin then? Thank you, but no.]]></string>
<string id="538657"><![CDATA[That's right. ]]></string>
<string id="538658"><![CDATA[That's not really your business.]]></string>
<string id="538659"><![CDATA[Then speak, oynon. In this, we are on the same side.]]></string>
<string id="538660"><![CDATA[Then I won't aid you. Your lines are not familiar to me. They even cross out mine. Why would I aid you?]]></string>
<string id="538661"><![CDATA[I'll manage just fine without you, Ripper.]]></string>
<string id="538662"><![CDATA[Very well. I am doing this at the Inquisitor's request. You trust her, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="538663"><![CDATA[I am sure that these bacteria have a mineral origin. Its origin might be connected to the history of this place.]]></string>
<string id="538664"><![CDATA[The local soil has rather unusual structure. The earth has something akin to an internal crust. Even water can't pass through it. Why?]]></string>
<string id="538665"><![CDATA[I don't know. That is what I would like to verify.]]></string>
<string id="538666"><![CDATA[I got quite a letter from you… Blackmail, is it?]]></string>
<string id="538667"><![CDATA[Not at all. Just keeping you informed.]]></string>
<string id="538668"><![CDATA[It sounded like a threat.]]></string>
<string id="538669"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="538670"><![CDATA[Not at all. It sounded like an offer. A favour for you, oynon. A helping hand.]]></string>
<string id="538671"><![CDATA[Have you lost your mind?]]></string>
<string id="538672"><![CDATA[No. Right now you're on a railway that leads straight into the abyss. While our cars are still aligned, I invite you to jump into the one going across the chasm, not down.]]></string>
<string id="538673"><![CDATA[So you have indeed lost your mind.]]></string>
<string id="538674"><![CDATA[As soon as I get home I'll take to writing you an answer. It'll be more convincing that way, for I have a knack for the epistolary.]]></string>
<string id="538675"><![CDATA[I should be writing letters like that to you, not the other way round.]]></string>
<string id="538676"><![CDATA[Think of what I said, oynon. Oh, and also don't trust the Changeling. She is evil.]]></string>
<string id="538677"><![CDATA[Can't argue with that.]]></string>
<string id="538678"><![CDATA[There's nothing to think about. Everything has already been thought of.]]></string>
<string id="538679"><![CDATA[Why? Please be so kind as to explain yourself.]]></string>
<string id="538680"><![CDATA[No one had any illusions on this account... ]]></string>
<string id="538681"><![CDATA[...A battering ram, to be precise. Although that is also a dubious honour. Why is her goal so insane?]]></string>
<string id="538682"><![CDATA[Why did you call me a ram then? You were implying I'm a sheep, weren't you? Why does she need me here?]]></string>
<string id="538683"><![CDATA[She could offer him ten official reports... Inquisitors know how to do that. ]]></string>
<string id="538684"><![CDATA[No. The Commander is smart. Well, perhaps not very smart, but he's very astute when it comes to honour. He'd see the deceit straight away. Aglaya knows that very well. No, she needed you to get at him with your honesty… because you believed you were telling the truth.]]></string>
<string id="538685"><![CDATA[Wait... I need to collect my thoughts... ]]></string>
<string id="538686"><![CDATA[Anyone could play that role, I say!]]></string>
<string id="538687"><![CDATA[As you can see, you've fit into it perfectly. Bravo! Encore! And your persona was… "the smartest and the fairest". Others would have been less convincing in this role. Aglaya wanted to make a precise strike. She couldn't afford to make mistakes.]]></string>
<string id="538688"><![CDATA[...She had Burakh. He trusted her so much... and he's indifferent towards the Tower... ]]></string>
<string id="538689"><![CDATA[Burakh is dead. He fell several hours ago while trying to wrest his inherited rights from Foreman Oyun's hands. The Abattoir has swallowed him. There's only me and you now. Think, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="538690"><![CDATA[I don't believe you. I need facts. ]]></string>
<string id="538691"><![CDATA[I don't believe you, Changeling… You cannot be trusted because you always contradict yourself.]]></string>
<string id="538692"><![CDATA[Why should I care for your Maria Kaina? Yesterday I might have been afraid of her. But now I'm beginning to feel my own power. Also I'm not the Mistress of the Earth. She is mistaken.]]></string>
<string id="538693"><![CDATA[Really? ]]></string>
<string id="538694"><![CDATA[My power is not of this world. Do you understand? ]]></string>
<string id="538695"><![CDATA[No, I don't.]]></string>
<string id="538696"><![CDATA[I understand that this is a formality. Maria definitely possesses some kind of magnetism, I acknowledge that. And if the townsfolk care for it, the rest of you—other girls of the same kind but of lesser standing—are supposed to acknowledge her power.]]></string>
<string id="538697"><![CDATA[...Ah, is now really the time to talk about it? So what does this Maria want with me?]]></string>
<string id="538698"><![CDATA[Nothing special. A simple formality. You must acknowledge her.]]></string>
<string id="538699"><![CDATA[Why have the Kains told that you are not the third Mistress?]]></string>
<string id="538700"><![CDATA[What? They did? Which one? Victor or Georgiy? This is very important! ]]></string>
<string id="538701"><![CDATA[Victor. ]]></string>
<string id="538702"><![CDATA[Georgiy. ]]></string>
<string id="538703"><![CDATA[Ha! Then it's all bosh. Be on your way, Bachelor. I shall speak to Maria myself... If she wants me to, that is.]]></string>
<string id="538704"><![CDATA[As you wish. But don't expect me to help you… today or tomorrow! Farewell.]]></string>
<string id="538705"><![CDATA[I do not know myself... Yes, they may be right... They were talking about the Mistress of the Earth, after all. Did he say anything about my miracle-making abilities?]]></string>
<string id="538706"><![CDATA[We will crush you, Changeling. You serve death while Maria serves life. Come round.]]></string>
<string id="538707"><![CDATA[Are you a miracle-maker?]]></string>
<string id="538708"><![CDATA[No. ]]></string>
<string id="538709"><![CDATA[You take me for another person! ]]></string>
<string id="538710"><![CDATA[Then what is the nature of the power you're beginning to feel?]]></string>
<string id="538711"><![CDATA[By the way, two days ago I received a little letter from you. What was it supposed to mean?]]></string>
<string id="538712"><![CDATA[Take it at face value, Bachelor. Nothing has to be broken, believe me! This town is alive! As for you and Haruspex, you are demons, deceived and ruthless; your eyes are white for you are blind; your tongues are red for you thirst for blood; yourselves are invincible for you are hollow! One of you wants to decapitate it, another—to slice away its body!]]></string>
<string id="538713"><![CDATA[Stop rhapsodizing, Clara. Your tricks are cheap.]]></string>
<string id="538714"><![CDATA[And you? ]]></string>
<string id="538715"><![CDATA[And I will keep everything. Both of you are destined to fail! Both of you will ruin that which can live united. United tragically, but united still! Let them argue, let them deny one another—but that is exactly how it grows! The town is inconceivable without the Tower; the Tower is impossible without the town!]]></string>
<string id="538716"><![CDATA[How are you going to keep it all? It's impossible. ]]></string>
<string id="538717"><![CDATA[True. It can only happen miraculously. You can't do that. Just trust me—that will be your miracle! Although Burakh doesn't need that anymore… He has paid for his thickness in spades.]]></string>
<string id="538718"><![CDATA[I can do that. You'll see.]]></string>
<string id="538719"><![CDATA[We'll see. Your letter was impressive. If I ever get out of here, I'm going to keep it as a memento of this trip.]]></string>
<string id="538720"><![CDATA[Because of what happened yesterday I can't help but feel worried about you. Please don't rush headlong into your independent investigation. Keep in mind that the army is a force to be reckoned with, and any mistake we make may well be our last.

What we need to do is to wait and to collate our observations. I will be waiting for you at the Cathedral.

<string id="538725"><![CDATA[Certainly. ]]></string>
<string id="538726"><![CDATA[Only if you drop the act and start telling me everything.]]></string>
<string id="538727"><![CDATA[I have no interest in that… Inquisitor.]]></string>
<string id="538728"><![CDATA[Wonderful. Let everyone do what they are best suited for. Mysticism is for the mystics, the depths of the earth and their relics—for the true believers, and intellectual paradoxes—for the intellectuals. The Abattoir will reveal itself to Burakh… while that strange tower, I believe, will reveal itself only to you.]]></string>
<string id="538729"><![CDATA[That's what I'm hoping for as well. I was just going to discuss this with Victor Kain.]]></string>
<string id="538730"><![CDATA[My impression was quite different… for now, at least.]]></string>
<string id="538731"><![CDATA[You'll manage just fine without my assistance. I won't feel slighted.]]></string>
<string id="538732"><![CDATA[I see that you don't trust me after what happened yesterday. Removing me from the frontlines, are you?]]></string>
<string id="538733"><![CDATA[I wish I could start this letter on a happier note, Bachelor, but I am utterly crestfallen.

There is hardly a more harrowing discovery than to look back on the life you have lived and to see how little you have managed to do. I am almost out of time and the only thing I want is to pass whatever it was that gave meaning to my existence on to somebody else. Unsurprisingly, I see no better man to confide in than yourself. Please come to see me when you can.

P. S. I hope that the Tower will open up before you. It is very important. ]]></string>
<string id="538734"><![CDATA[Victor's Invitation]]></string>
<string id="538735"><![CDATA[Will you look at him—ain't he tall, ain't he vested in emergency powers…]]></string>
<string id="538736"><![CDATA[I haven't come here to talk. Know what I mean? ]]></string>
<string id="538754"><![CDATA[Don't bite the hand that feeds you, Grief... It won't end well.]]></string>
<string id="538755"><![CDATA[And I think I know how to find one…]]></string>
<string id="538756"><![CDATA[I've only been there four times in my life; the only way in for me has always been through the Termitary. Every morning a crowd of workmen comes out of it, walks between the buildings and is swallowed up by the Abattoir's main entrance—the one they call the Gorge. Tycheek would always open and close it himself. But now he's dead, and you're out of luck.]]></string>
<string id="538757"><![CDATA[Yes, I'm aware of that.]]></string>
<string id="538758"><![CDATA[That's fine; it's not like his place at the Termitary's been left vacant, right? And now I'm even more interested in seeing the horrific results of your actions…]]></string>
<string id="538759"><![CDATA[The road into the Abattoir will have to pass through the Termitary. Superintendent Tychick is dead, and the overal state of affairs is best described as "absolute anarchy". Nevertheless, I am certain that someone will have to accept the burden of authority sooner or later. Whoever it will be, he will allow me passage into the bowels of the earth.]]></string>
<string id="538760"><![CDATA[Serves you right.]]></string>
<string id="538761"><![CDATA[I'll check on the situation. I was meaning to anyway… They're waiting for me there.]]></string>
<string id="538762"><![CDATA[Moron. Be on your way.]]></string>
<string id="538763"><![CDATA[You can't make me not go. So I will!]]></string>
<string id="538764"><![CDATA[The first person he discusses the situation with is going to be me. So believe me, I'll make sure he won't even let you to his quarters.]]></string>
<string id="538765"><![CDATA[I will determine how the situation unfolds, not you.]]></string>
<string id="538766"><![CDATA[I'm keeping an eye on you anyway! You are still a very suspicious person…]]></string>
<string id="538767"><![CDATA[Like I have nothing better to do than search your blood for fancy diseases!]]></string>
<string id="538768"><![CDATA[Really, it's all because I'm an outsider. Suspicions follow me everywhere! And pray tell, what's so wrong about me? Anyway, that was a relief. Allow me to thank you with a very special kiss…]]></string>
<string id="538769"><![CDATA[Go ahead.]]></string>
<string id="538770"><![CDATA[Are you by any chance reciting some monologue? It's hard to believe the Saburovs are capable of such fervent scenes. ]]></string>
<string id="538771"><![CDATA[They very much are. Katerina has only just turned thirty. As for fervency... she has quite an exquisite temper, just so you know. Morphine in her head and passion in her blood, oh, she's capable of many things. A demonic woman. ]]></string>
<string id="538772"><![CDATA[And that brings us smoothly to the most pressing matter. I need a sample of your blood. ]]></string>
<string id="538773"><![CDATA[I'm waiting. ]]></string>
<string id="538774"><![CDATA[Here. Take it. I have nothing to be afraid of. I just don't like the sight of blood, is all... Ouch! Does it have to be so painful? Why are you taking so much…? I'm going to faint... You're trying to kill me, you butcher... But I'm not guilty!]]></string>
<string id="538775"><![CDATA[How about I shoot you, you mezzo-soprano, huh…? It's not like there'll be anyone to mourn the loss! And you know me—if something is required for the job to be done…]]></string>
<string id="538776"><![CDATA[Where is the Changeling?]]></string>
<string id="538777"><![CDATA[Ummm... Who knows, right? Ask the Saburovs. They're probably still crying their eyes out for their miraculously acquired little baby daughter! No, children are the root of all evil in this world, let me tell you…]]></string>
<string id="538778"><![CDATA[And now I need a sample of your blood. ]]></string>
<string id="538779"><![CDATA[I'll ask them.]]></string>
<string id="538780"><![CDATA[What? I haven't squeezed out even an ounce yet. ]]></string>
<string id="538781"><![CDATA[I think she's having a fit…]]></string>
<string id="538783"><![CDATA[This isn't Lara.]]></string>
<string id="538784"><![CDATA[This isn't Yulia.]]></string>
<string id="538785"><![CDATA[Surprisingly... this isn't Aspity either.]]></string>
<string id="538786"><![CDATA[This isn't Anna.]]></string>
<string id="538787"><![CDATA[Yet somehow she knew to found The House of the Living in advance… Somehow she stocked up on water in advance, if only for a few people… Somehow she avoided having an isolation ward in her very house… So many coincidences, wouldn't you agree? But oh how naïve she looks, how tender the voice, how inviting the little vein on the neck...]]></string>
<string id="538788"><![CDATA[That can't be…]]></string>
<string id="538789"><![CDATA[Indeed… but it doesn't prove anything yet!]]></string>
<string id="538790"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="538795"><![CDATA[No one is allowed inside the Tower. Khan's orders. You'll lead soldiers to us!]]></string>
<string id="538796"><![CDATA[I have a message from the Inquisitor to Khan. ]]></string>
<string id="538805"><![CDATA[I'm a doctor, not a soldier. And there are no soldiers with me. ]]></string>
<string id="538806"><![CDATA[Where?]]></string>
<string id="538807"><![CDATA[I'm investigating that right now. None survived. And the warehouse thieves have grown even fiercer, even though they managed to fight us off.]]></string>
<string id="538808"><![CDATA[What does that mean? Are you intending to die? ]]></string>
<string id="538809"><![CDATA[We are back at the starting point now. We deal with the issue of death differently. When the original identity is extinguished and an entirely new one arises in its place—is that death? Is madness not a form of death? Is loss of memory not the true death?]]></string>
<string id="538810"><![CDATA[That's just philosophy… Surely you didn't summon me here for that!]]></string>
<string id="538811"><![CDATA[Indeed. You see, I'm out of means to influence my son. Now that the town is occupied by soldiers, he is going to turn the Polyhedron into a fortress under siege, which will infuriate the army. I fear that his ill-advised actions may result in the Tower's destruction.]]></string>
<string id="538812"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="538813"><![CDATA[There is a fourth Kain. What's to become of him?]]></string>
<string id="538814"><![CDATA[Are you about to lose your mind or your memory? And letting me know in advance just like that?]]></string>
<string id="538815"><![CDATA[You're joking... But I am completely serious. What I'm trying to say is precisely that we could involuntarily enter a strange state in which we all would, in a manner of speaking, lose ourselves… A slumber, from which we will not awaken for a long time. Who would take care of our affairs then?]]></string>
<string id="538816"><![CDATA[You would entrust them to me?]]></string>
<string id="538817"><![CDATA[Yes, very much so. Would you be willing to watch over… no, not over us, but over the garden which we have spent all our lives growing? There are many sharp axes around which would hack it away into oblivion.]]></string>
<string id="538818"><![CDATA[Yes, I would. But only until my business here is finished.]]></string>
<string id="538819"><![CDATA[No, I would not. I don't want that kind of responsibility.]]></string>
<string id="538820"><![CDATA[Thank you. Now allow me please to lay out my first request.]]></string>
<string id="538821"><![CDATA[You have my attention. I imagine your request has something to do with the Tower?]]></string>
<string id="538822"><![CDATA[How can it be prevented?]]></string>
<string id="538823"><![CDATA[I agree. What would you do if your words could influence Kaspar?]]></string>
<string id="538825"><![CDATA[So you're getting ready to die?]]></string>
<string id="538826"><![CDATA[Because for the first time in many years our town has drawn the attention of the Powers That Be. They are going to enforce their idea of order here. The Inquisitor is just the first of many things to come.]]></string>
<string id="538827"><![CDATA[She's a special Inquisitor. She is here because of unusual circumstances which you are aware of.]]></string>
<string id="538828"><![CDATA[Let's get back to the Polyhedron. I interrupted you with my question.]]></string>
<string id="538829"><![CDATA[There's nothing to negotiate. I want to see it, not listen to some stories—I've done enough listening already.]]></string>
<string id="538830"><![CDATA[Exactly. The enemy, on the other hand, had fourteen thousand casualties, if I recall correctly.]]></string>
<string id="538831"><![CDATA[What is it?]]></string>
<string id="538832"><![CDATA[These rifles will not fire a single shot until the soldiers step onto these stairs. Promise?]]></string>
<string id="538833"><![CDATA[Yes. I promise. It's a fair condition. Now show me my rifles. ]]></string>
<string id="538834"><![CDATA[Will you be able to keep your followers in check? Will they withstand the temptation?]]></string>
<string id="538835"><![CDATA[Khan… what was that?]]></string>
<string id="538836"><![CDATA[What did you see?]]></string>
<string id="538837"><![CDATA[I didn't understand a thing.]]></string>
<string id="538838"><![CDATA[What is it made of? Is it cardboard?]]></string>
<string id="538839"><![CDATA[The magic lantern.]]></string>
<string id="538840"><![CDATA[Wow... That is actually a lot! Were you taught how to do this?]]></string>
<string id="538841"><![CDATA[No.  ]]></string>
<string id="538842"><![CDATA[So you didn't seen the mirrors?]]></string>
<string id="538843"><![CDATA[Did you even see a single facet? Did you see the events unfolding behind it? The contents are written on them. Sometimes we even write down our dreams on the facets.]]></string>
<string id="538844"><![CDATA[No wonder.]]></string>
<string id="538845"><![CDATA[Where is the thousand of children?]]></string>
<string id="538846"><![CDATA[I've only seen a well and some stairs. ]]></string>
<string id="538847"><![CDATA[No. Still, where are all the tower-dwellers?]]></string>
<string id="538848"><![CDATA[What do you mean, where? Behind the facets. In each other's daydreams and night dreams, oftentimes shared. Only those who have been pushed out wander the stairs.]]></string>
<string id="538849"><![CDATA[Where is the thousand of children?]]></string>
<string id="538850"><![CDATA[Pushed out?]]></string>
<string id="538851"><![CDATA[Some dreams threaten death and danger. If a child dies, they're pushed out onto the stairs. They can return in later, but it usually takes them a while to recover… And, well, some of them do return to the stairs voluntarily—unable to withstand the emotional intensity.]]></string>
<string id="538852"><![CDATA[Are you sure you're not pulling my leg?]]></string>
<string id="538853"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="538854"><![CDATA[You're a grown-up. You will never be able to comprehend this. Adults see nothing inside. Why else would Peter Stamatin drink himself twyre-eyed? This is why. He's created the most magnificent sorcery there is, but even he cannot see it. Can you imagine the torture he has to endure?]]></string>
<string id="538855"><![CDATA[Thanks for the reminder! I'll have hi explain something to me…]]></string>
<string id="538856"><![CDATA[Yes. It's excruciating. Goodbye, Khan. Thank you for bringing me back my childhood, if only for a moment. I've already forgotten what it's like...]]></string>
<string id="538857"><![CDATA[I've been to the Tower, Inquisitor. ]]></string>
<string id="538858"><![CDATA[I'm dying to hear your account. What is inside?]]></string>
<string id="538859"><![CDATA[A thousand children.]]></string>
<string id="538860"><![CDATA[Mirrors, Inquisitor. ]]></string>
<string id="538861"><![CDATA[Something… else. It seems to be at odds with any and all common sense.]]></string>
<string id="538862"><![CDATA[Impossible! It's just a specular prism. A crazy chamber with dozens of mirrors and light sources reflecting each other to drive a person insane… Is this some kind of joke?]]></string>
<string id="538863"><![CDATA[Not at all.]]></string>
<string id="538864"><![CDATA[Of course it's a joke. So you've been there too?]]></string>
<string id="538865"><![CDATA[You saw the mirrors too? Well, how was it? Has your sanity withstood that challenge without much difficulty?]]></string>
<string id="538866"><![CDATA[So you've been there too?]]></string>
<string id="538867"><![CDATA[Not quite, Bachelor... It must be a remarkably curious structure. A Focus, huh?]]></string>
<string id="538868"><![CDATA[So the Polyhedron is the Focus?]]></string>
<string id="538869"><![CDATA[Yes. That's what it is.]]></string>
<string id="538870"><![CDATA[I believe it would make sense for us to talk about it tomorrow... If it is what I think it is, then it's outstandingly exciting. Come back tomorrow. Do you need anything? ]]></string>
<string id="538871"><![CDATA[Yes, I'm almost completely broke. Getting into the Tower was a rather costly endeavour.]]></string>
<string id="538872"><![CDATA[No, nothing. See you tomorrow, Inquisitor. ]]></string>
<string id="538873"><![CDATA[And so?]]></string>
<string id="538874"><![CDATA[Even if that is so, it doesn't oblige me to anything. Hopefully, this won't sour my relationship with you.]]></string>
<string id="538876"><![CDATA[What happened to them, by the way?]]></string>
<string id="538877"><![CDATA[I don't know if something has happened… but something could happen any time now. They're a remarkable lot, you know… that have some remarkable family rites. They have this tradition for, I think, commemorating the dead, when they shut themselves in and refuse to allow absolutely anyone to communicate with them.]]></string>
<string id="538878"><![CDATA[So it would be reasonable to speak with them about the Tower before they… set about their family tradition?]]></string>
<string id="538879"><![CDATA[Basically, yes. If you're too late, communication could become quite difficult. That I know from experience. Although I doubt that they will tell us what we really want to know about the Tower. Just speaking with them is not enough. I need documents.]]></string>
<string id="538880"><![CDATA[Are they absolutely necessary?]]></string>
<string id="538881"><![CDATA[I understand.]]></string>
<string id="538882"><![CDATA[Sorry, the thought has slipped my mind.]]></string>
<string id="538883"><![CDATA[I completely agree with you. I can't wait for learn more myself.]]></string>
<string id="538885"><![CDATA[You think so? ]]></string>
<string id="538886"><![CDATA[I believe so. In any case, I'll speak with the Kains.]]></string>
<string id="538887"><![CDATA[How about some water?]]></string>
<string id="538893"><![CDATA[Five? Why do you need that many?]]></string>
<string id="538894"><![CDATA[I'm not planning to drink them. I need them for self-immolation. Go, go, I'll wait for you. Burning twyrineless is frightening—its vapours would exalt me to subtle planes; I'd be a mere pile of ash falling to the ground otherwise. I'd just "feed the earth," as the Steppe people say... it'd gag anyway.]]></string>
<string id="538896"><![CDATA[Oh, damn you to hell... Just don't do anything stupid. I'll have another word with you later.]]></string>
<string id="538897"><![CDATA[Don't worry about the designs. They'll be in good hands.]]></string>
<string id="538898"><![CDATA[I do care. Soon I'll prove that to you in practice.]]></string>
<string id="538899"><![CDATA[…What happens to them afterwards? If I do convert them?]]></string>
<string id="538900"><![CDATA[The evil will not touch them. You will see it for yourself. They will become invulnerable to the scythe that will cut down the brazen, the blind, and the bellicose. Save them.]]></string>
<string id="538901"><![CDATA[All right.]]></string>
<string id="538902"><![CDATA[Do tell me more!]]></string>
<string id="538903"><![CDATA[Speak on!]]></string>
<string id="538904"><![CDATA[Go on, go on…]]></string>
<string id="538905"><![CDATA[No mother would hit her child so hard as to kill it…]]></string>
<string id="538906"><![CDATA[Why, the town will live... Who is to live in it, the Earth cares not, even if we do. The mother is not concerned with the germs in her child's body... until they make it ill. There are beneficial and harmful germs. When the child is ill, the mother gives it medicine to drink, in order to purge the harmful ones.]]></string>
<string id="538907"><![CDATA[Now I understand…]]></string>
<string id="538908"><![CDATA[So be it. What am I to do now?]]></string>
<string id="538909"><![CDATA[You shall begin with Grace, the late cemetery caretaker's daughter. She is especially dear to me.]]></string>
<string id="538910"><![CDATA[One shouldn't strive to be liked by those one wants to turn to the truth.]]></string>
<string id="538911"><![CDATA[What of it? Isn't it better this way?]]></string>
<string id="538912"><![CDATA[Well! I see that the latest news have been too much of a shock to you. You're looking upset and bewildered. What a strange look you have in your eyes, girl... You ought to go to sleep, get some rest immediately. But Clara, are you really so easy to lead astray? This is the song of evil!]]></string>
<string id="538913"><![CDATA[…And who was this Willow?]]></string>
<string id="538914"><![CDATA[...She was nice, a real baby doll... But I did to her the same thing the Caravan had been doing to children: ground her into flour, unwove her into threads; I don't even know how I did it...]]></string>
<string id="538915"><![CDATA[Flour and threads? You're mad, aren't you?]]></string>
<string id="538917"><![CDATA[Yes, now I see that you're mad. You deserve to be exterminated.]]></string>
<string id="538918"><![CDATA[Well, speak now!]]></string>
<string id="538919"><![CDATA[Simon is alive. Fully alive, do you understand? Eva's told me secretly!]]></string>
<string id="538920"><![CDATA[How can she know?]]></string>
<string id="538921"><![CDATA[The Bachelor has Eva completely under his thumb! She's like a slave to him now—but she also knows his secrets. And guess what—he's colluded with Stakh Rubin, an apprentice of Isidor's, a surgeon and former mercenary. Together, they're now hiding Simon from the Kains! Making it look like he's dead...]]></string>
<string id="538922"><![CDATA[Ah... I love secrets of every kind!]]></string>
<string id="538923"><![CDATA[Why are you telling me this?]]></string>
<string id="538924"><![CDATA[You need to check if Eva's telling the truth... do check! And afterwards, inform the Kains about that newcome Bachelor! Do you understand how that will change your life? They'll stop persecuting you! You'll gain their favours and earn a lot of money... Or perhaps you don't care about money at all?]]></string>
<string id="538925"><![CDATA[I'm very scared of this Bachelor... I feel that he's a demon, a spirit of destruction and downfall!]]></string>
<string id="538926"><![CDATA[And so—he killed the boy?]]></string>
<string id="538927"><![CDATA[He said, "I'll do the job; I like it a lot when business gets bloody." "I'll find that scoundrel of yours," he said, "and if I see that he deserves death, I'll cut him into little pieces right on the spot..." And I don't know what possessed me to agree, but I did.]]></string>
<string id="538928"><![CDATA[And you're regretting it now? There, there... How did it come about at all that such words escaped your lips?]]></string>
<string id="538929"><![CDATA[I don't know what to do with myself now... If I could only bring him back, the scoundrel! Just to think that I gave someone the right to decide if he should live or die!]]></string>
<string id="538930"><![CDATA[That's true... who are we to ever have such a privilege?]]></string>
<string id="538931"><![CDATA[But perhaps he's left the traitor alive after all? Eh, I'm afraid not. Lika is not the type to make an impression of a creature deserving to live... And they say some young lad's been killed by the Station; the description matches.]]></string>
<string id="538932"><![CDATA[Don't cry! Be firm. Someone had to decide this.]]></string>
<string id="538934"><![CDATA[Yes. That's how it usually happens... with people of the kind.]]></string>
<string id="538935"><![CDATA[Don't despair. The Haruspex has spared him; I know that for certain.]]></string>
<string id="538936"><![CDATA[It's good that you're filled with regret. You'll soon find that repentance is beneficial.]]></string>
<string id="538937"><![CDATA[So that's who it was... This Lika, he's dead now. I'm sorry to pain you, but I know that for sure.]]></string>
<string id="538939"><![CDATA[How do you know?]]></string>
<string id="538940"><![CDATA[I was the one who decided if he should live or die.]]></string>
<string id="538941"><![CDATA[His death was inevitable. Higher powers killed him, not you. He wasn't a boy at all, but a real monster. So don't blame yourself.]]></string>
<string id="538942"><![CDATA[I just do.]]></string>
<string id="538943"><![CDATA[Where are you, my girl? We didn't finish our conversation yet. Come back to us. The streets are too dangerous a place for you to stay... Besides, was it not fate that led you, unmistakably, to our home? Why, then, are you so intent on rejecting our hospitality?

Waiting for you, implacably,
Katerina]]></string>
<string id="538944"><![CDATA[Katerina is Worried]]></string>
<string id="538945"><![CDATA[...sister of mine, who can trickle through a tiniest crack, crawl through a barely visible hole, it is almost as though you could seep through the pores in human skin. It is as if you were not a human being, but a nectar-sweet moisture of volatile spirit! How is this even possible?

People trust you; that's how.

Have no fear. Go where you will—and nothing will touch you. Speak your mind—and no one will reject you. Hear them out—and nothing will evade your attention.

There is but one question I want to ask—what is it that you do to make people love me less and less, trust me less and less, even when I am asleep?

Whatever you answer me, remember I love you more than anything and will never be angry with you.

Here I am, take my hand...]]></string>
<string id="538946"><![CDATA[You are the only one who can do it...]]></string>
<string id="538947"><![CDATA[...since they call you both names? Whether or not you're a saint is not for you to judge, but can you at least remember what it was that you stole? Why do they try to chase you, to hunt you down, as if you were the world's worst offender?

Sister of mine, don't you cry. Don't give in to despair. As powerful as your enemies are, your protectors wield greater power. 

A villain should be judged. A saint should perform miracles. If you cannot spare time for these everyday commitments, rest assured I will take care of your affairs for you!

I am going to visit the Skinners district today.

Do you recognise my hand yet?]]></string>
<string id="538948"><![CDATA[Are you a saint or a thief...]]></string>
<string id="538949"><![CDATA[She wants to do a good deed, so she makes a shelter for the living, where people who want none of your miracles may hide. Furtively, out of control, she collects the money she then spends on provisions. She is an angel, they say. And no one, not  a single person would call her a thief...

<string id="538953"><![CDATA[Daughter (for this is how we want to call you from now on)!

I am brought down by a heavy burden: Katerina is sick and she won't be able to perform the tasks of a Mistress without your help.

Much labour awaits you. We will let you run free, but be prepared that every single day, either me or my wife will have an errand for you. Be at hand.

With great expectations,
Your loving father]]></string>

<string id="538955"><![CDATA[...that's how they name anyone who is hiding from the law. This is our worst enemy, the Law, as merciless, cruel, and unrighteous as it is. The Law thinks nothing of whatever falls between the arms of its scale. The Law does not believe in anything that falls inbetween the black and the white.

The Law is impossible to appease. Its motion is heavy and devastating. For the time being you have escaped its all-seeing eye. You were thinking, perhaps, that it won't find you here? That's how it was, for a long time.

As of today, however, everything has changed. Were my traces uncovered? Is my miraculous power not enough to hide myself?]]></string>
<string id="538956"><![CDATA[I know why they call me a thief...]]></string>
<string id="538957"><![CDATA[There is a creature that wants to have a word with you. They call it a shabnak and think it is the maneater itself, although I don't find it all that scary... Perhaps, there is some mistake.

It wants to talk to you.

Your friend Grace]]></string>

<string id="538959"><![CDATA[I know everything about you now. I know it was you who got inside the Catheral. I know you have left there the presents the other people gave you. I know that you are the very person whom the Bound see whenever the streets by their homes get infected with Sand Plague!

You are not going to escape. The only thing that may save you is giving yourself up to me of your own accord. I promise I will let you live, then, I will not surrender you to the crowd, but take you with me to the Capital instead. And there I will study you.

Come to me, my girl.

<string id="538961"><![CDATA[...before dawn. I was lying at the riverbank with my feet under the water. My arms were stretched out and there were handfuls of earth in my grasp.

I praised heaven for my salvation and then turned my thoughts to my beloved children, the ones entrusted to me. It is very difficult to reach them, however, so I have no other choice but to take care of the other Bound. I took some of them in my ward already so you need not worry on their behalf.

I placed my hands on the shoulders of my Bound ones and went after you. I've been searching for you all day long. Alas, you have slipped away today, as you always do. My wonderful hands did too much labour today, they won't serve me anymore... Everything will be just fine. I will see you soon enough, my dear.]]></string>

<string id="538963"><![CDATA[...make a visit to the Cathedral. They need me there, I feel, else the worst could happen... Where are you? What do you have on your mind? I've lost your trace once again.

I also cannot escape the feeling that the Bachelor and the Haruspex, the two merciless strangers whom nature itself would command to eliminate each other, have joined forces to destroy me instead. Where are you? I am so worried about you...]]></string>

<string id="538965"><![CDATA[Oh, I do know what it's about! There's this local usurer... I'll tell you later how I'm involved here. So Tough Vlad decided to pocket his blood money. Vlad himself had had to pay up quite heftily. He transferred the funds to your new father yesterday.]]></string>
<string id="538966"><![CDATA[But what does that have to do with you?]]></string>
<string id="538967"><![CDATA[We'll come to that, my dear. The Hunchback refused to give Vlad the money. So Vlad said he'd find a way to bring him to heel—pressure someone who could reveal all the skeletons in the Hunchback's closet. That was a direct hint at me! Vlad had found out about my involvement with the Hunchback.]]></string>
<string id="538968"><![CDATA[But it's hardly something that Alexander wanted to find out…]]></string>
<string id="538969"><![CDATA[Please my dear, save me from those infernal Olgimskys! Vlad is terribly, unbelievably cruel; he can't control his anger. He can smash an oak table into splinters; he can condemn hundreds of people to torture just to quench his own fury! Help me, and I'll be completely open with you! Find out if Big Vlad is scheming against me!]]></string>

<string id="538975"><![CDATA[Well, think of something. You'll surely manage, I sense an angelic power in you! I, of course, would have used his children to get to him... but they're already grown-up and I wouldn't be able to handle them at this point. But you will!]]></string>

And here's the result—she's making up imaginary enemies now.]]></string>

<string id="539046"><![CDATA[Why, then, do people say that you're a performer from the Caravan?]]></string>
<string id="539047"><![CDATA[...Because they wanted to make me one of their lot... Tried to make a singer out of me. Dressed me up in motley-patterned stockings and a whalebone corset... so that children would come to look at me and listen to my frolicky songs... But it didn't work.]]></string>
<string id="539048"><![CDATA[A mishap? Why?]]></string>

<string id="539050"><![CDATA[Tell me how it happened. It's a fascinating subject…]]></string>
<string id="539051"><![CDATA[...Because I'd been born ugly and mute... No-one would play with me, and I couldn't even say "mommy"... All the while dreaming of becoming a real singer! I had thought they'd teach me to sing at the Caravan... and make me beautiful...]]></string>
<string id="539052"><![CDATA[How would that be possible, if you were mute?]]></string>
<string id="539053"><![CDATA[...They had sorcery in their blood. They made stage artistes out of children like myself...

<string id="539083"><![CDATA[A Reminder from the Family]]></string>
<string id="539084"><![CDATA[This is to inform you that the conflict between Artemy Burakh and Bachelor Dankovsky has escalated out of proportion. It is as though they have made a decision to challenge each other. The situation is fraught with negative consequences. Blood will be spilled. The Bachelor knows no remorse. He is preparing for an offensive manoeuvre somewhere in the Backbone district.

The Haruspex is working somewhere in the Skinners district right now. As far as I can see from the latest reports, he is likely to be found in one of the double houses. You must reach him in time to warn him, so that he's able to relocate at once. I will reward you handsomely for that.

The locked down districts are dangerous, there are robbers and looters on the loose. However, I am confident that no bandit survived in the house Burakh has chosen. Besides, there is a cohort of the Kin people at his side now. The Bachelor has his own posse, however, so you must hurry!

<string id="539085"><![CDATA[Where is the Haruspex?]]></string>
<string id="539086"><![CDATA[Just as I thought, Clara, the two medics that hold our fate in their hands have decided to fight each other. They give every appearance of friendship now, but each one of them is furtively preparing a group of henchmen, primed to capture, maim, and destroy their opponent. My spies have informed me of the preparations that the Bachelor undertakes.

I am powerless here, for I cannot arrest the Bachelor while I still need his services.

The best we can do is to warn Burakh of the possible assault. He is working in a house next to the Lump, the Olgimsky family home.

I will reward you generously,
Aglaya Lilich]]></string>
<string id="539087"><![CDATA[Warn the Haruspex]]></string>
<string id="539088"><![CDATA[I have yet another request to make of you. No doors are closed before you and no part of the town is unknown to you. Neither bullets nor blades are a threat to you for no one in the town will dare to attack you.

Artemy Burakh is in danger once again. He is working in Earth now, near the Bone Stake Lot. In one of the double houses, most likely. You have to warn him, the assault may happen any moment from now! I will reward you very well.

Aglaya Lilich]]></string>
<string id="539089"><![CDATA[Seeking Out Burakh]]></string>
<string id="539090"><![CDATA[I wish I didn't have to ask this of you, but I don't seem to have any other choice. He will die today, unless you deliver a timely warning. There is no one else I can ask. The patrolmen lack intelligence, and the Executors are cowardly and self-serving.

He is somewhere by the Works, I think, in the adjacent district. There is a large house surrounded by three smaller ones there—he is in either of the four.

Tell him he must leave immediately!

I will give you everything I have left if you agree to help me one last time.

<string id="539094"><![CDATA[I have to ask you for a favour once again. They're much embittered by the events that took place yesterday. They both went to see Commander Block today, and the meeting gave the Haruspex additional incentive to end Daniil once and for all.

Daniil went to the Tanners district to speak to Andrey. After that, for some unknown purpose, he wanted to inspect the houses next to the twyrine shebeen.

Please tell him he must leave there at once. The drunkards from the shebeen were likely to reveal his whereabouts to the Haruspex. We don't have much time.

Rest assured I will repay you this service—as well as services to follow.

<string id="539096"><![CDATA[I am writing to you with a request of the same kind. Please find Daniil and warn him of the danger he is in. He is working in one of the wealthy houses that may be entered via the small garden to the north. The Haruspex knows about it. He's going to attack as soon as he's back from the Abattoir.

Warn him, my Mistress of the Earth. Let us forget our rivalry for a while. There will be enough time for that later.

The Bachelor is in the Stone Yard now, somewhere close to the tombs where he is mourning Maria. Tell him he is being hunted. The Haruspex is searching for him in order to kill him. I know you don't have much love for the Bachelor, but he is one of the few allies I have left. I will need him alive tomorrow. Help me.

It's good that I am so well-acquainted with you, since we will have a lot to discuss when the time comes for us both to govern this town. To lay the basis for further negotiations, I'd like to ask for a favour that a Mistress may ask of another Mistress.

The Bachelor, the man whom I've chosen, fell victim to another man's hatred. This other man is someone we both despise: Burakh the Haruspex, who is going to become a Warden and the new Foreman soon. With his cohort of butchers and blood-crazed Worms, Burakh prowls all around the town. They may discover the Bachelor any moment now, and the servants that I have entrusted with helping him may not be enough to rebut the attack.

Daniil is somewhere in the Backbone district near the Town Hall.

I will offer you a decent reward.

<string id="539107"><![CDATA[*** Did something go wrong? Why? Is this a lesson in humility, or should I see it as an omen? Which one of us is the Changeling after all? And these miserable cripples are still faithful to her...]]></string>
<string id="539108"><![CDATA[He's working. He's fighting the Sand Plague with selfless abandon. He's here and there—setting up the town's defences against the disease, going round and assigning tasks, inquiring, gathering materials, observing, reflecting... He's preparing to quell the disease and stop the epidemic!]]></string>
<string id="539109"><![CDATA[He's in danger, Eva. Anna Angel wants to inform on him. I must warn him.]]></string>
<string id="539110"><![CDATA[Does he know a man named Rubin?]]></string>
<string id="539111"><![CDATA[That would be out of line for me to ask, Clara... Rubin has vanished under mysterious circumstances. Some people say the shabnak killed him so she could devour Simon's body; others say Rubin himself... well, people say lots of different things. Why are you asking?]]></string>
<string id="539112"><![CDATA[Where does he work, Eva? How can I find him?]]></string>
<string id="539113"><![CDATA[Why do you need to? If you want to see him, stay here at my place; he'll certainly be back around nightfall.]]></string>
<string id="539114"><![CDATA[The infection has spread further through the town. There's no telling if the district he's in now is still clean... And I'm handing out pills.]]></string>
<string id="539115"><![CDATA[Because your Rubin is a criminal! And I should think the Bachelor is his accomplice. Tell me where he is; better tell me while I'm asking kindly!]]></string>
<string id="539116"><![CDATA[And did he tell you how to contact him in case of an emergency? Because this is that case.]]></string>
<string id="539117"><![CDATA[So what? My Daniil fears no one. He's more fearsome than all of our local smugglers combined. His hand is firm and he shoots sharp. If someone does try to harm him, they'll quickly come to regret it.]]></string>
<string id="539118"><![CDATA[I need to know where he is, Eva. It's urgent!]]></string>
<string id="539119"><![CDATA[No, Clara, you don't need to. He forbade me to disclose it to anyone. Fine friend I'd be if I betrayed his trust the very next day after he'd confided in me.]]></string>
<string id="539120"><![CDATA[There are new pills against the infection. He doesn't know about them yet. Give me money and I'll buy some for him. ]]></string>
<string id="539121"><![CDATA[Look me in the eye, Eva! Will you agree...]]></string>
<string id="539122"><![CDATA[You're wrong to distrust me... But I'll drop by again soon, Eva.]]></string>
<string id="539123"><![CDATA[Gladly, Clara! Clearly they don't call you a saint for nothing. Take what I have, I hope it will be enough.]]></string>
<string id="539124"><![CDATA[Where do I bring the pills? It's better to give them to him as soon as possible, so he doesn't get infected on his way home…]]></string>
<string id="539125"><![CDATA[No, no, no! I know your powers. Go away! You're not getting any answers from me.]]></string>
<string id="539126"><![CDATA[Pity about that... Really.]]></string>
<string id="539127"><![CDATA[I just wanted to catch my breath and rest a little. Your place is lovely...]]></string>
<string id="539128"><![CDATA[That's fine. I'll find him there. Secrets like these are never much of a secret.]]></string>
<string id="539129"><![CDATA[How foolish of you to spill the beans! What if it wasn't me? Behold! You've just brought about your Daniil's death...]]></string>
<string id="539130"><![CDATA[He came here to witness a genuine miracle. He believes he will find here what he would never have found at the Capital. He had been searching—and lo, fate brought him to my door. He's better than anyone who ever walked this earth...]]></string>
<string id="539131"><![CDATA[Because he's doomed. What if he came here to work miracles instead of observing them?]]></string>
<string id="539132"><![CDATA[Because there's a great chasm between you and him.]]></string>
<string id="539133"><![CDATA[...The moment his boots stepped on the dusty soil of our roads, the moment he took a deep breath of our air, the moment his shadow fell on the cobbles of our town, I knew that my life had changed, and that it was approaching its acme. He has come, and now I live for his sake...]]></string>
<string id="539134"><![CDATA[…Why do you love him so much?]]></string>
<string id="539136"><![CDATA[Doomed? I don't understand what you're saying at all... What does being able to work miracles have to do with anything? No, miracle-workers aren't doomed! Even those of them whose lives are short live them to the fullest in a way you couldn't live a thousand ordinary lives! ]]></string>
<string id="539137"><![CDATA[Look at me, Eva. I can work miracles. I can sense their nature. Mark my words: neither you nor he will get any miracles for as long as you're expecting them with such greed and entitlement!]]></string>
<string id="539138"><![CDATA[Why? No, Clara, you didn't see what we saw. You're being too serious. Those who watched Scarlet Nina build the town, who watched Simon play with our children, would never say it's futile to demand a miracle... One can, and in a way, one must!]]></string>
<string id="539139"><![CDATA[Believe me, it's because of teachings like these that the disease has struck your town. For as long as the town is afire with this naïve, criminal, and greedy hope, you will go on suffering and dying. I know it. I am the harbinger.]]></string>
<string id="539140"><![CDATA[Is it that great? Not really. He longs for miracles; he needs living evidence of the impossible... Yet was this not what I used to brood on daily and nightly? Was this not the reason I shed so many tears over our useless Cathedral?]]></string>
<string id="539141"><![CDATA[Look at me, Eva. I can work miracles. I can sense their nature. Mark my words: neither you nor he will get any miracles for as long as you're expecting them with such greed and entitlement!]]></string>
<string id="539142"><![CDATA[He is not like you. He's a cold-hearted demon.]]></string>
<string id="539143"><![CDATA[What's wrong with your Cathedral?]]></string>
<string id="539144"><![CDATA[You're asking me? You, who are called a saint, whose tender heart ought to know the answers to such questions? Why, you're just testing me... I'll tell you. Look at the place where true miracles are meant to be happening: it's empty and dead like the shell of a bad nut.]]></string>
<string id="539145"><![CDATA[I'll tell you why.]]></string>
<string id="539146"><![CDATA[Are you hoping that it will come back to life?]]></string>
<string id="539147"><![CDATA[Of course I am! And you know, I feel that it's going to come back to life any day now—now that you've all come here! You, the girl with miraculous hands, are here for a reason too! I'm sure that the Cathedral will spring back to life very soon—for his sake. And I will help...]]></string>
<string id="539148"><![CDATA[No, Eva. It's not going to happen while you think about it like that.]]></string>
<string id="539149"><![CDATA[Well... Go on hoping then. Perhaps it will be just like you say.]]></string>
<string id="539150"><![CDATA[Well well... So that's what the utopian false doctrine looks like. Why, it sure is beautiful.]]></string>
<string id="539151"><![CDATA[Did you call my words a false doctrine?]]></string>
<string id="539152"><![CDATA[All right. I won't try to dissuade you, Eva. Go on living for the sake of your love…]]></string>
<string id="539153"><![CDATA[That's precisely why you've gathered here, you miracle hunters... That is why your Bachelor is here: to meet his death—for it was people like you who that incurred the wrath of heaven. I am the harbinger of this truth. Reconsider before it's too late.]]></string>
<string id="539154"><![CDATA[I can.]]></string>
<string id="539155"><![CDATA[I will take care of him.]]></string>
<string id="539156"><![CDATA[He says we have to fight... To hope for the impossible until the very end.]]></string>
<string id="539157"><![CDATA[He's the one who'll do the fighting. Not you, gentle Eva... Sleep.]]></string>
<string id="539158"><![CDATA[How can you tell? I, for one, know it's not true...]]></string>
<string id="539159"><![CDATA[No. I haven't seen him.]]></string>
<string id="539160"><![CDATA[You probably didn't look hard enough! He's bound to be hiding here somewhere!]]></string>
<string id="539161"><![CDATA[I've searched every room in every house; I listened to the banging of doors inside, I would even light my lamp, and now the wick is all gone. There was no one in here!]]></string>
<string id="539162"><![CDATA[Oh great. So I've wasted several precious hours because of that bloody sod. And I still haven't obtained any dead tissue…]]></string>
<string id="539163"><![CDATA[Mark my words, it won't be two days before you thank heavens for letting the Ripper escape your wrath today…]]></string>
<string id="539164"><![CDATA[Take heart. Dead tissue will soon be in no short supply. Enough for you and for everyone walking these streets.]]></string>
<string id="539165"><![CDATA[Aren't you afraid that he'll overpower you? He looks menacing…]]></string>
<string id="539166"><![CDATA[Not afraid at all. I'm well armed.]]></string>
<string id="539167"><![CDATA[He's armed even better... We'll see who wins.]]></string>
<string id="539168"><![CDATA[I have. Don't try to scare me. Men armed with pistols, scalpels, and kitbags are more dangerous than infected clouds!]]></string>
<string id="539169"><![CDATA[Eva?]]></string>
<string id="539170"><![CDATA[No. Capella. Aren't you here on her request?]]></string>
<string id="539171"><![CDATA[Yes, precisely, Eva. She's cried her grey eyes out... Go to her, will you?]]></string>
<string id="539172"><![CDATA[You're the one doing the errands, not me. I'm doing my own work here. Actually, that reminds me: have you by any chance seen a dodgy-looking lad around? I told him to get lost but now I'm not sure he listened. You could tell by his eyes he was a weaselly fellow.]]></string>
<string id="539173"><![CDATA[No, Bachelor... You're the only weaselly fellow here that I'm aware of.]]></string>
<string id="539174"><![CDATA[I wonder what you were up to while he was out there risking his little life. I've sent him away.]]></string>
<string id="539175"><![CDATA[That's intense... So what happens now?]]></string>
<string id="539176"><![CDATA[I've been trying to track him down for some time now. He's certainly somewhere close. Flashed past a while ago, actually. If you happen to see him, tell me which house he's in. I'll deliver on rewards. In coin as well as medicine. They will come in handy.]]></string>
<string id="539177"><![CDATA[Whose body did he snatch?]]></string>
<string id="539178"><![CDATA[Now that's something you don't need to know. But it very likely was the exact body that I need.]]></string>
<string id="539179"><![CDATA[And what if that child Loafer were to encounter him? Have you thought about that?]]></string>
<string id="539180"><![CDATA[That makes you the body-snatcher! And certainly no better than him!]]></string>
<string id="539181"><![CDATA[What you're talking about is utterly beyond me.]]></string>
<string id="539182"><![CDATA[I'm not angry with you. I think I know what this is about…]]></string>
<string id="539183"><![CDATA[...Really? Do you really want to do something nice for me? I don't even know what to say... You know, sometimes I feel that there is no one better and kinder than you in the whole world, and that whatever you might do would be good, even for me...]]></string>
<string id="539184"><![CDATA[But sometimes you feel differently, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="539185"><![CDATA[Yes... Yes, sometimes I feel as though you and I were enemies. And you are a very dangerous enemy—seeing as you're not human... Ah, what am I saying. Got a headache, sorry... It's all this terrible air.]]></string>
<string id="539186"><![CDATA[You're just like Maria! Only a little kinder... but generally the same.]]></string>
<string id="539187"><![CDATA[I'd like to do something for you regardless…]]></string>
<string id="539188"><![CDATA[I really want to.]]></string>
<string id="539189"><![CDATA[You know... I've told the Bachelor to go to Skinners, which is the disease hotbed... A little boy named Loafer was going to test a toxic powder there. But I still haven't heard from the Bachelor... Perhaps he didn't find the boy?]]></string>
<string id="539190"><![CDATA[I see... Would you like me to find the Bachelor? Or Loafer?]]></string>
<string id="539191"><![CDATA[What powder?]]></string>
<string id="539192"><![CDATA[That doesn't matter... A terrible poison, but the children believe it can purge you of the Sand Pest... Will you find him?]]></string>
<string id="539193"><![CDATA[Who?]]></string>
<string id="539194"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="539198"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="539199"><![CDATA[You have no business being here, Changeling. You shouldn't have come here. We've been doing just fine without you…]]></string>

<string id="539201"><![CDATA[And so? Have you chosen your fate?]]></string>

<string id="539204"><![CDATA[Stop... Hear me out before you approach Block.]]></string>
<string id="539205"><![CDATA[Speak. You're going to talk about your plan, aren't you?]]></string>
<string id="539206"><![CDATA[That's an outcome I didn't expect. Why did you do it?]]></string>
<string id="539207"><![CDATA[Go. Hurry up.]]></string>
<string id="539208"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="539209"><![CDATA[There's one last thing I want to tell you…]]></string>
<string id="539210"><![CDATA[Yes?]]></string>
<string id="539211"><![CDATA[I didn't expect an outcome like that…]]></string>
<string id="539212"><![CDATA[It's up to you to decide.]]></string>
<string id="539213"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="539214"><![CDATA[It's good that you've found me here and approached me. Now you will have to perform the sacrament for which we—well, for which you, Changeling, thief, saint, Sand Pest, envoy of the Law and harbinger, came into this world. Are you ready?]]></string>
<string id="539215"><![CDATA[Who am I, sister?]]></string>
<string id="539216"><![CDATA[Farewell, sister. I'm leaving forever—and you're staying. You are indeed unlike any of them…]]></string>
<string id="539217"><![CDATA[Did you hear what I said? Do you understand what I've done? I reject this revolt against the Law and nature.]]></string>
<string id="539218"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="539219"><![CDATA[You came too early. The queens of this chessboard are assembling to decide the fate of what remains of this sorry little town at seven p.m. Right now the Cathedral is closed.]]></string>
<string id="539221"><![CDATA[I can't let you any further, Changeling. Don't start thinking I'm abusing my position; it's a mere formality, of course, but you still have your confidants. Have you really had no time for a trifle like that?]]></string>
<string id="539222"><![CDATA[I'll check now. Perhaps I've forgotten something…]]></string>
<string id="539223"><![CDATA[Come, Changeling. The assembly is awaiting your decision. The queens of this chessboard are in a deadlock; they have each other pinned down. The game may very well end in a tragic stalemate. You're the promoted pawn, and it's the endgame. Go and finish it!]]></string>
<string id="539224"><![CDATA[I know, I know... You didn't have to bother explaining.]]></string>
<string id="539225"><![CDATA[They've already begun. Are you going in?]]></string>
<string id="539226"><![CDATA[Yes. I am.]]></string>

<string id="539228"><![CDATA[So every single Bound has survived? Unbelievable!]]></string>
<string id="539229"><![CDATA[They can't all survive... Some will certainly perish. That's how things stand.]]></string>
<string id="539242"><![CDATA[You are right. I forgot completely.]]></string>
<string id="539243"><![CDATA[Thanks for visiting us. Go in. You're being awaited.]]></string>
<string id="539244"><![CDATA[Not at all.]]></string>
<string id="539245"><![CDATA[What are you waiting for? Go in. Even we have no power over the passage of time in this place.]]></string>
<string id="539246"><![CDATA[I'll enter when I deem necessary.]]></string>
<string id="539247"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="539248"><![CDATA[You and I cannot lose. The two will be joined, my power and your conscience. Your purity, Clara.]]></string>
<string id="539249"><![CDATA[Here's hoping.]]></string>
<string id="539250"><![CDATA[It's time to leave.]]></string>
<string id="539251"><![CDATA[Yes, yes... let us go.]]></string>
<string id="539252"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="539253"><![CDATA[Well then... let us commence. I'm going to ask you formally, in order to get this over with quicker. One word from you and it happens. So you are positive that it was neither greed nor plotting nor circumstance that has informed your choice, but your conscience alone. I've been given orders to level everything here. But if this isn't necessary, I'll trust you on it. My trust for you is infinite.]]></string>
<string id="539254"><![CDATA[I'm not ready to make a choice yet. I need a little time to think!]]></string>
<string id="539255"><![CDATA[As you wish. I'm waiting for a word from you. All I ask of you is to be clear. Avoid nuance. And don't leave us before you've spoken your sacred will.]]></string>
<string id="539256"><![CDATA[I won't be able to do that in the first place.]]></string>
<string id="539257"><![CDATA[Let the Settlement be destroyed. But don't fire at the tower of glass. It must survive the tremor of an artillery barrage.]]></string>
<string id="539258"><![CDATA[So shall it be then.]]></string>
<string id="539259"><![CDATA[Would you like to talk to the Bachelor?]]></string>
<string id="539260"><![CDATA[Yes. I like him. Besides, he's seen the blueprints and knows the structure of the groundwork. Together we'll calculate how to destroy the town without damaging the Tower. Do you definitely believe that this is what must be done?]]></string>
<string id="539261"><![CDATA[Yes. This is definitely what must be done.]]></string>
<string id="539262"><![CDATA[We'll only destroy the Polyhedron, as the Haruspex is suggesting. There's no point in razing the whole town.]]></string>
<string id="539263"><![CDATA[So shall it be then.]]></string>
<string id="539270"><![CDATA[Yes. This is definitely what must be done.]]></string>
<string id="539271"><![CDATA[There's no need to destroy anything. We can do altogether without gunfire and preserve this world as it is. Even though many think it impossible…]]></string>
<string id="539272"><![CDATA[Good. Do you really know a way to preserve this town?]]></string>
<string id="539273"><![CDATA[Yes. I'm restoring the chain of creation. I'm giving Simon back to this town. I'm closing the chain. I hereby declare that from now on, only goodwill, love, and dedication shall, time and time again, be the safeguards of this tiny world's existence. Would you like to know how I'm going to do it?]]></string>
<string id="539274"><![CDATA[...I hereby announce that the choice has been made. The council is dismissed.]]></string>
<string id="539275"><![CDATA[The choice has been made... Now everything's been resolved.]]></string>
<string id="539276"><![CDATA[But that's all a mere formality. What is this town to me indeed? A decoy, a proving ground for someone's character! But there's one precious thing that I will take out of this place... Won't I?]]></string>

No. This is not how it was. I think I understand now.

You know you are going to leave us before long, so you renounce your chance to perform a miracle and assume the mantle of the Law. You hold our mutual enemy to your breast and dive headfirst into the chasm. Is this your attempt to dismiss the inevitable?

There is still hope, however, for even though you will leave, I will stay. I will remain here to keep the fate that you have rejected.

Isn't that so?

No. Don't answer me. Just remember I will always remain by your side.

<string id="539482"><![CDATA[...On the other hand, I have suspected that it would be impossible to pinpoint the culprit at once. That tips the scale a little more against your twin sister!

<string id="539485"><![CDATA[…Indeed? And... what did they say was causing it?]]></string>
<string id="539486"><![CDATA[It may be a sign from above: she was struck by the Sand Plague. I have dispatched a watchman to keep everyone out of her house. I hope you weren't mistaken. Now there will be no epidemic…]]></string>
<string id="539487"><![CDATA[Small wonder.]]></string>

<string id="539489"><![CDATA[You didn't expect us to write you a letter, did you? But—here it goes. You have our attention at last.

So, you say that you were meant to become a miracle-worker? Now that's debatable. We would assume that you are mistaken, but we don't want to disappoint you—and ourselves, for that matter—ahead of time.

From what we saw of the Bachelor and the Haruspex, who have yet to cause us anything apart from petty chagrin and all too predictable (if sometimes elegant) choices, neither of the two have succeeded in overcoming the inevitable. Such is the Law, even though we're sick of it already! Don't be surprised. Did you think the Powers That Be and the Law are always in concordance? We did affect this was the case for a long time, but we would no longer pretend before a heartseeker like you. The truth is, we're fed up with the Law.

This town is precious to us, as you can see. So if you succeed in keeping it intact, to preserve it just as it is now, this will be, take our word for it, a true miracle. Compared to that, everything you did before is cheap market tricks of dubious value. Such is our well-considered decision.

<string id="539514"><![CDATA[I was actually quoting Grief. He loves this kind of folksay, claims it attracts luck to weapons and averts malicious spells. Taking lives is disturbing, you know. Anyone who dares do that will get their just desserts… I know that from experience.]]></string>
<string id="539515"><![CDATA[He's been getting uncanny ideas. He wanted to pay visits to all his early, ahem, works—I mean the ugly ruins, the "stairways to heaven" that are scattered around the town. He said he needed to find the ideal place for something—and I have no idea what he has in mind...]]></string>
<string id="539516"><![CDATA[All right. So what about the adventure?]]></string>
<string id="539517"><![CDATA[He broke loose and ran outside... Wild and disoriented… fell across some soldiers… I've been told he had been preparing to leave his humble abode beforehand, someone's heard the ruckus. Thankfully I got there in time! He managed to provoke the royal riflemen somehow, so they started clubbing him. And then... well, you know me.]]></string>
<string id="539518"><![CDATA[...How many? ]]></string>
<string id="539519"><![CDATA[All too well. Do you even realize the consequences? ]]></string>
<string id="539520"><![CDATA[Three flamethrower-wielding freaks. And an officer.]]></string>
<string id="539521"><![CDATA[Life doesn't teach you anything... What you are going to do? ]]></string>
<string id="539522"><![CDATA[I see… I see. What can I say? Well done, Andrey Stamatin… you heartless bastard! Why did you leave him alone?]]></string>
<string id="539523"><![CDATA[What's wrong with you? I'll just deal with everything that needs to be dealt with—and that's it, I'm never leaving him again. All our lives we've been persecuted for being extraordinary! As soon as a genuis sets foot out of his house, he's immediately struck by lightning! You must know that—we're birds of feather, you and us...]]></string>
<string id="539524"><![CDATA[Yes. This is true... I could have easily been in your shoes. ]]></string>
<string id="539525"><![CDATA[No, Andrey, we are not birds of feather… you're absolutely mental!]]></string>
<string id="539527"><![CDATA[What's up with Peter, Andrey? Where is he? ]]></string>
<string id="539530"><![CDATA[I'm listening. ]]></string>
<string id="539531"><![CDATA[At last I realized that any building is an edifice. A concurrence of planes, lines, rhythms, and temperatures that can become a perfect vessel for a soul. Not a human soul, no; a bigger one! The soul that no man can communicate with yet, for it has no shape, cycle, or voice...]]></string>
<string id="539532"><![CDATA[Are you referring to an intelligent being?]]></string>
<string id="539533"><![CDATA[I don't know. Neither did I know or experience this soul back then—I only sensed its existence and loved it in advance. When my passion reached its zenith, I realized I just couldn't live like that any longer. I wanted to speak its tongue, I wanted to touch it!]]></string>
<string id="539534"><![CDATA[Go on, go on…]]></string>
<string id="539535"><![CDATA[And so I gradually began to try. I started to design buildings that were not buildings; chambers that people couldn't live in—everyone thought I was either a madman or a joke… Only my brother believed in me. He and the few that were privy to my secret. They knew that my designs were not intended for men, but rather for this wondrous soul...]]></string>
<string id="539536"><![CDATA[And what came out of that? ]]></string>
<string id="539537"><![CDATA[Finally I understood that I was on the right track! I knew I've discovered an insane but genuine feature that only a lover can feel—and I knew I was striking true! I constructed project after project, but… all of them contravened the laws of earthly physics and geometry. Seems like my beloved soul was unlikely to find a permanent shelter on this earth... ]]></string>
<string id="539538"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="539539"><![CDATA[Chimeras, they were all chimeras... Nobody would have allowed me to even model them... if not for Nina the Wild! Oh, that's when my brother and I met her! She married Victor, went to live here and provided me with everything—the place, the materials, the working hands, and—most importantly—the hearts willing to believe in miracles.]]></string>
<string id="539540"><![CDATA[What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="539541"><![CDATA[I mean that buildings demand people. Moreover, they demand the people that would demand those buildings back! Museum showpieces, models, abstractions, mind games—these are all not my cups of twyrine. Nina gave me a whole living town—a town aching and craving to go heavenwards, to the stars—a town desperately hungering for a crown—the crown I've given to it!]]></string>
<string id="539546"><![CDATA[It's hot, Peter... The story is going to take a while, why don't you come over here?]]></string>
<string id="539547"><![CDATA[Was it that beautiful?]]></string>
<string id="539548"><![CDATA[Peter, this heat is intolerable. How can you stand it? ]]></string>
<string id="539549"><![CDATA[And how could I stand that which was burning me from the inside all these years? No, no; you're a medical man, a cynical man, a geometrician, you're not a poet—you'll never understand. You cannot see the profound. You fear death!]]></string>
<string id="539550"><![CDATA[Well, no, I don't… But go on.]]></string>
<string id="539551"><![CDATA[And you don't? On the other hand, obsession does indeed eliminate fear.]]></string>
<string id="539552"><![CDATA[The eternal curse of dreamers like you and I... ]]></string>
<string id="539553"><![CDATA[So what can your Polyhedron really do?]]></string>
<string id="539554"><![CDATA[I cannot put it into words. It's only been tested by the children yet. If you asked them, they'd tell you that it brings their dreams to life, plays their games, daydreams with them, transports them into someone else's fantasies. Heard anything about it?]]></string>
<string id="539555"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="539556"><![CDATA[But the Kains could tell you even more! They'd tell you this is a vessel that can hold the most precious substance of all—the focus of a soul… But even they cannot understand what they've been granted. Neither can I. And I will never be able to repeat it... I'm dead...]]></string>
<string id="539557"><![CDATA[Well, now I've heard it—from you.]]></string>
<string id="539558"><![CDATA[So this is suicide? ]]></string>
<string id="539559"><![CDATA[Maria asked me to tell you something.]]></string>
<string id="539563"><![CDATA[…She did? What? ]]></string>
<string id="539564"><![CDATA[She will become a Mistress and construct your latest invention. She gave me her word. ]]></string>
<string id="539565"><![CDATA[Take it, Peter. Die if you really want to. ]]></string>
<string id="539568"><![CDATA[I have.]]></string>
<string id="539569"><![CDATA[You are delirious… ]]></string>
<string id="539570"><![CDATA[You will find the answer one day, Peter. ]]></string>
<string id="539571"><![CDATA[I am Bachelor Dankovsky, an authorized representative of the Inquisitor, head of the sanitary staff. Your company commander should have informed you.]]></string>
<string id="539572"><![CDATA[Right. So what are you here for?]]></string>
<string id="539573"><![CDATA[No, you'll be the one to answer my questions, not the other way around. On what authority are you here? Answer—unless you fancy a court martial, that is.]]></string>
<string id="539574"><![CDATA[Are you trying to order me around, you civvie rat? Got yourself a death wish?]]></string>
<string id="539575"><![CDATA[No. I don't.]]></string>
<string id="539576"><![CDATA[Name and number of your unit. Now!]]></string>
<string id="539577"><![CDATA[No, nothing. ]]></string>
<string id="539578"><![CDATA[This is your final warning. Any further attempt to engage in conversation with me will be your last one.]]></string>
<string id="539579"><![CDATA[You will regret this… You're nothing but mutineers and looters, not soldiers on duty!]]></string>
<string id="539580"><![CDATA[I'll keep that in mind.]]></string>
<string id="539581"><![CDATA[I am on duty as well. I want to hear a full report. Now.]]></string>
<string id="539582"><![CDATA[Why in the world would I do that? ]]></string>
<string id="539583"><![CDATA[We're going to find the offender sooner or later anyway… We already have tactical data suggesting that one of the offenders is hiding in the ruined building in the central part of the town and is presenting armed resistence. I suggest you cooperate in his arrest. Or else.]]></string>
<string id="539584"><![CDATA[He'll come back here soon. Wait and he'll be here.]]></string>
<string id="539585"><![CDATA[Is that so... ]]></string>
<string id="539586"><![CDATA[I've built it from prisms and mirrors! I've managed to focus them, to capture the perfect trick of the light and dream… That's right! I'm a trickmaster, the ultimate magician! I've focussed the aura of magic just like a lens focusses sunrays! And now the town is dying... poisoning my precious wreath, my crystal bud, my Focus...]]></string>
<string id="539587"><![CDATA[I think so too…]]></string>
<string id="539588"><![CDATA[Great. Perhaps you should even become friends.]]></string>
<string id="539589"><![CDATA[I'm afraid of him... He'll chase me away.]]></string>
<string id="539590"><![CDATA[That means you're guarding your lady poorly!]]></string>
<string id="539591"><![CDATA[I've brought these... offerings to her. ]]></string>
<string id="539592"><![CDATA[She must receive them personally from the hands of the other two. It's strange that she has entrusted you with this affair.]]></string>
<string id="539593"><![CDATA[Give them to your lady. The sooner, the better. ]]></string>
<string id="539594"><![CDATA[Impossible. We shouldn't touch them. The lady will be distressed—or even angry. If you cannot find her anywhere, just leave the offerings at the tomb of Nina the Scarlet. No one will touch them there, and it would be best for the House.]]></string>
<string id="539596"><![CDATA[Nothing strange about it. I will not fail her confidence and trust.]]></string>
<string id="539597"><![CDATA[You were simply focussing your sight on a single point for too long, mate. You should not forget to look around.]]></string>
<string id="539598"><![CDATA[Let me see Maria. ]]></string>
<string id="539599"><![CDATA[It is impossible. The lady is sleeping. She cannot be disturbed now, however important an occasion. Only the lady's maids are allowed inside—they are tending to her body.]]></string>
<string id="539600"><![CDATA[And I happen to share her opinion on the matter. ]]></string>
<string id="539601"><![CDATA[Is Grief to blame for starting this plague?]]></string>
<string id="539602"><![CDATA[Mark said that there's some sort of Rat Prophet living in the basement of the town's Theatre, some lying spirit who has taken over Katerina.]]></string>
<string id="539603"><![CDATA[Wait, are you crying? ]]></string>
<string id="539604"><![CDATA[Was he arrested? ]]></string>
<string id="539605"><![CDATA[No, he was not arrested. They came in, pointed the guns at him, grabbed him by the arms, and took him away... The neighbours told us to come here because all the soldiers get their orders here. We came in, but he's not here—never was…]]></string>
<string id="539606"><![CDATA[Where could he have been taken? ]]></string>
<string id="539608"><![CDATA[No thank you, pumpkin. Leave it to yourself. ]]></string>
<string id="539609"><![CDATA[This is exactly what "arrested" means. They must have had a reason. Go home.]]></string>
<string id="539610"><![CDATA[Where could they have been taken to? ]]></string>
<string id="539611"><![CDATA[I have no idea. We tried to interrogate the children, but they only sob and refuse to utter a single distinct word! ]]></string>
<string id="539612"><![CDATA[…It's just "both", no "the". But it doesn't matter now. Where did they take them? ]]></string>
<string id="539613"><![CDATA[He was taken to the courtyard, and there the soldiers gathered the men from our entire street! They asked them if they're going to help them arrange a provocation. And Daddy said that they wouldn't! Then the main one, the guy with iron teeth, said, "To the cemetery—quick—march!" And they took them there... That's all I know!]]></string>
<string id="539614"><![CDATA[There will be a chance. As for now, go home immediately!]]></string>
<string id="539615"><![CDATA[You just didn't get a chance to check it for sure, you blockhead! Oh you blockheads...]]></string>
<string id="539616"><![CDATA[It's nothing. ]]></string>
<string id="539617"><![CDATA[They don't. The news of your execution was a surprise for the general. ]]></string>
<string id="539618"><![CDATA[Why did they do this to you?]]></string>
<string id="539619"><![CDATA[As far as I understand, one division here wants to attack another. They needed us for a provocation or something. Said they're going to seize the weapon.]]></string>
<string id="539620"><![CDATA[Curious...]]></string>
<string id="539621"><![CDATA[No, way more. Twenty or so. Only four of us are left... And if not for you, there would have been none.]]></string>
<string id="539622"><![CDATA[So it has begun. The army is out of control... ]]></string>
<string id="539623"><![CDATA[Peter! Where's your brother Andrey? ]]></string>
<string id="539625"><![CDATA[I hope you're not suggesting that she had eliminated her seniors to grab power?]]></string>
<string id="539626"><![CDATA[I thought after yesterday's incident he'll cling to you like a limpet. Yet here you are—all alone once again.]]></string>
<string id="539627"><![CDATA["Sister"]]></string>
<string id="539628"><![CDATA[My precious albino, this peculiar alter ego of mine, was expelled from the Town! This effigy of my indecision, crafted out of someone else's keepsakes, has gone away; just as it should have done. It walks towards the Steppe now, moving through the Rotten Field. I will be able to get ahold of him if I come by the hanging sacks at three hours before midnight.]]></string>
<string id="539629"><![CDATA[*** Oh no, I am not going to the Prophet. I am quite happy with what he said of me already... and with what he revealed of my sister, if she exists.]]></string>
<string id="539630"><![CDATA[How did you get home after what happened yesterday? ]]></string>
<string id="539631"><![CDATA[So this is how pirate treasures come to be... ]]></string>
<string id="539632"><![CDATA[Here are the signs of acknowledgement from Clara and Capella. They send their regards to you, Dark Mistress. ]]></string>
<string id="539633"><![CDATA[Precisely. This is what differentiates a utopia from a dream. There is a "top" in "utopia", but don't let the word deceive you: it's all about what's down below. It requires dirt. A ruby firmament needs something to sit atop—otherwise it'd topple. A utopia can appreciate the earthly and the humane in their raw homeliness. That is why we have the blood-stained Abattoir, the Rotten Field, the dens, and Earth—the collective name of the poorer districts—itself.]]></string>
<string id="539634"><![CDATA[Is that so... ]]></string>
<string id="539635"><![CDATA[A utopia needs the Cult of Bulls, a living echo of the time when the human and the bestial world sung in unison. Beastliness lies at the heart of our civilization. Dirt, blood, manure, devourment, skins, meat, and bone tools. This is what the human civilization of creators originates from.]]></string>
<string id="539636"><![CDATA[Architectural constructions seem to make passions run high. Some people demand the Abattoir to be razed, and others want to do the same to the Polyhedron. It's like they're living creatures.]]></string>
<string id="539637"><![CDATA[They are living creatures, Daniil Dankovsky.]]></string>
<string id="539638"><![CDATA[Poetry, even more poetry... ]]></string>
<string id="539639"><![CDATA[Oh no, it isn't! Take the Abattoir—and old body, an organ petrified with age, the thing that the earth breathes through. A vociferous spirit inhabits it—a spirit devoid of history, memory, name, or kin. An ancient lifeforce that has in reality been long dead.]]></string>
<string id="539640"><![CDATA[What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="539641"><![CDATA[The light of the stars long extinguished still reaches us. The distance is so great that the light keeps penetrating space even though the star itself is long gone. It's the same with Earth. It's soaked with the humours of an ancient life—the life that gave birth to every thing in existence long before men came into being. The source is gone now, but the humours keep flowing, trying to reach the sun...]]></string>
<string id="539642"><![CDATA[What about the Polyhedron? ]]></string>
<string id="539643"><![CDATA[The Polyhedron is a mirror that preserves the reflection of the person that has looked into it the last. You know, when Nina died, Maria said she may never be able to cope with grief… she started to pine away. That is when Focus was created.]]></string>
<string id="539644"><![CDATA[By Peter? ]]></string>
<string id="539645"><![CDATA[Yes. I don't know how he managed to do it. I think that's because he loved Nina so much. Anyway—he ended up creating a space she could inhabit. Can you imagine? You come into a room and can definitely feel that she's there—as if you've simply turned away from her for a second... And you can talk to her.]]></string>
<string id="539646"><![CDATA[But what does it have to do with the Polyhedron?]]></string>
<string id="539647"><![CDATA[You still don't get it? Simon conceived the Polyhedron with a special purpose in mind. He never explained it to us. Children that have settled there were like little monkeys to him—he let them play there until it was time to use the Tower as intended.]]></string>
<string id="539648"><![CDATA[What was its purpose? ]]></string>
<string id="539649"><![CDATA[I think Simon has built it for himself. Exactly in case he…]]></string>
<string id="539650"><![CDATA[So it's a tomb... ]]></string>
<string id="539651"><![CDATA[I don't care, old boy. I only know one thing for certain: everything can go down a hole—but the Tower must be kept intact.]]></string>
<string id="539652"><![CDATA[Even if the Tower is destroyed now, nothing can be fixed anyway.]]></string>
<string id="539653"><![CDATA[It should be kept intact—if only for the uniqueness of this pathologic phenomenon.]]></string>
<string id="539654"><![CDATA[It needs to be rooted away immediately! And I will do it.]]></string>
<string id="539655"><![CDATA[The Scarlet Mistress. But it matters not. So if a miracle happens—if those who must remain alive by my design are still alive by tomorrow; is the merciless Powers That Be disregard us, like they used to; then we will be able to contest the ruthless law of existence. The dream will prevail. There will be a new Utopia.]]></string>
<string id="539656"><![CDATA[What is a utopia for you, Maria? ]]></string>
<string id="539657"><![CDATA[It's not the Tower, en-Daniil. It's the whole town. A utopia is not the dream of mercantile prosperity, sensible social structure, or political fairness to us—it's the mystical manifestation of a world inscrutable and inaccessible for men.]]></string>
<string id="539658"><![CDATA[Who am I speaking to? The mouth is yours, but neither the voice nor the choice of words is… ]]></string>
<string id="539659"><![CDATA[Indeed. Keep listening. This world exists, but it cannot be touched. Ever. It can reveal itself obliquely, but inevitably dies under direct scrutiny. It has a built-in essential stealth mechanism that launches self-destruction when this world is trapped.]]></string>
<string id="539660"><![CDATA[So Aglaya was right... ]]></string>
<string id="539661"><![CDATA[Probably. But luckily for us, even the most well-adjusted mechanisms fail. And the two worlds do still touch sometimes! Antibodies collide! And then they go against the law of self-preservation, merging into a wondrous symbiosis rather than dying. This is the state of Utopia—an earthly form of an unearthly miracle!]]></string>
<string id="539662"><![CDATA[And so you have constructed this town? Is this what an embodied miracle looks like? ]]></string>
<string id="539663"><![CDATA[Yes, we have. We could have create a mind-boggling place of rock crystal, sapphire walls, emerald roofs, and ruby pavements; a place akin to those you're used to seeing in children's fairy-tales about fairy countries. But this place is inhabited by people of flesh and blood. Why are you so surprised?]]></string>
<string id="539664"><![CDATA[Why the dirt and the pedestrianism? Why the disheveled walls, the rusty beams, the drain covers? Is this really what a utopia looks like?]]></string>
<string id="539665"><![CDATA[But how is it miraculous?]]></string>
<string id="539666"><![CDATA[Earth represents the miracle of the antropophobic Steppe merging with the human world. The Settlement represents the miracle of turning a society of devourers into a society of creators. The very logic of this town's existence is a miracle in and of itself. When the process of its creation has reached a peak, the Cathedral has been built. It's been a failure though...]]></string>
<string id="539667"><![CDATA[...And then the Polyhedron was created. ]]></string>
<string id="539668"><![CDATA[Yes. The Tower on the Other Side has become the representation of the final metamorphosis, the miracle of merging the realm of possibilities with the realm of the impossible.]]></string>
<string id="539669"><![CDATA[Why would anyone need a utopia? It's a chimera, nothing more.]]></string>
<string id="539670"><![CDATA[Wait. Is this the reason for the plague?]]></string>
<string id="539672"><![CDATA[If it's all so perfect, why is there a plague?]]></string>
<string id="539673"><![CDATA[I do not know, en-Daniil... It's not our fault. The town could not bear this tension, this heat—oh well, we shall restart it then. There is no death. We do not fear it. See—dead and incorporeal, I am still present… a restless soul destined to come back eternally.]]></string>
<string id="539674"><![CDATA[I've heard this recently… yes. This is the truth.]]></string>
<string id="539675"><![CDATA[You shouldn't have merged the extremes. Couldn't you have looked for a compromise?]]></string>
<string id="539676"><![CDATA[Mother hated compromises. That's why it all worked for her. She could also view it all as a graceful chain—she has interlinked all those powers, making then serve one another.]]></string>
<string id="539677"><![CDATA[How exactly?]]></string>
<string id="539678"><![CDATA[A failure you've failed to address…]]></string>
<string id="539679"><![CDATA[You are mistaken. The town has crawled from dirt and bestial selfishness towards the demand for a spiritual life; the demand for creation—pointless from the rational point of view. We have addressed this. The Cathedral was a failure exactly because it was merely a trade-off.]]></string>
<string id="539680"><![CDATA[A trade-off? ]]></string>
<string id="539681"><![CDATA[Yes. A convenient shape. Too human. Not real enough. A cathedral without God, without faith... No miracle can settle a building like this.]]></string>
<string id="539682"><![CDATA[And so you have built another shrine... ]]></string>
<string id="539683"><![CDATA[Mysticism, more mysticism... Theomachy. Could it have been the reason for everything that had happened? ]]></string>
<string id="539684"><![CDATA[What? Was it the Changeling, the future Mistress of the Earth, that has offered you these words along with the relics? These are her words. "Three miracles have begotten one another, but now the chain wants to circle back to a close. The disease has forged the final metamorphosis, turning the utopia into manure and bringing it back to the soil that everything has come from."]]></string>
<string id="539685"><![CDATA[An infernal transmutation if I've ever seen any. Is this what the girl everyone considers to be a saint is preaching?]]></string>
<string id="539686"><![CDATA[A horrible, but fair metamorphosis. ]]></string>
<string id="539687"><![CDATA[And which direction is right?]]></string>
<string id="539688"><![CDATA[None of them are, Bachelor Dankovsky! Do come to your senses! Let go of your pride! Let go of your victory and let me have mine! The town will stay, and nothing will have to perish! None of the three worlds will have to be sacrificed, neither beasts nor men nor children!]]></string>
<string id="539689"><![CDATA[Are you trying to convince me with shouting once again? I am not the person to be swayed by nervous exaltation! You may as well throw a fit—I still won't trust you.]]></string>
<string id="539690"><![CDATA[I need to think. ]]></string>
<string id="539691"><![CDATA[Are you sure? ]]></string>
<string id="539692"><![CDATA[Well, it's for the better... A new colourful star is rising in our skies—for the first time in many years. All hail its ascent…]]></string>
<string id="539693"><![CDATA[You're… happy? I thought Maria and you were rivals. ]]></string>
<string id="539694"><![CDATA[You sound sad.]]></string>
<string id="539695"><![CDATA[Look, this is simply insulting! Would I be worthy of being called a Mistress—in the future, if not right now—if I put my pride and my personal interests above the needs of a dying town? A Mistress will bring our town back to life, so her coming is a blessing.]]></string>
<string id="539696"><![CDATA[But this town won't be in tune with your design. At all.]]></string>
<string id="539697"><![CDATA[How would you change the town? ]]></string>
<string id="539698"><![CDATA[Oh, I have grand desings… I would change it completely. You know… It's scarlet now, scarlet and navy and taupe… I would make it golden and chalk and cinammon and chestnut. We'd have new powers, new ideas, new aspirations… it would be completely different.]]></string>
<string id="539699"><![CDATA[Would it be better?]]></string>
<string id="539700"><![CDATA[Seems like you're beginning to daydream too…]]></string>
<string id="539701"><![CDATA[Sounds interesting... and very beautiful. So what do you need to win and rebuild the town according to your design?]]></string>
<string id="539702"><![CDATA[...Are you serious? ]]></string>
<string id="539703"><![CDATA[No, of course not. I was just trying to be nice.]]></string>

<string id="539705"><![CDATA[Then trust Artemy Burakh. Take him to the Cathedral, having kept the lives of the children! He was unable to protect some of them because he was badly wounded in a fight with Foreman Oyun… I wonder how he got out of there alive. He wants to sacrifice the Tower in order to save the Settlement for me.]]></string>
<string id="539706"><![CDATA[I understand, Victoria. But I must fulfill my mission. That is my duty.]]></string>
<string id="539707"><![CDATA[Well, Victoria, rejoice—it aligns with my own intentions. I will take Burakh to the Cathedral and vouch for him in front of the Commander.]]></string>
<string id="539708"><![CDATA[She thinks the Tower is not for children. She thinks we've been taking someone else's place all this time. Now the one it has been built for will inhabit it. But the Tower is for children! Who are we if not the birds nesting among a factory's chimneys?]]></string>
<string id="539709"><![CDATA[Who will inhabit it?]]></string>

<string id="539718"><![CDATA[The Abattoir's voice is my voice now, oynon. And I'll tell you this: Oyun used to run things poorly. His bloodline was akin to mine, but he kept failing to learn the lines. He has commited numerous mistakes recently. I think it was he that dipped out the pest from the cavities five years ago.]]></string>
<string id="539719"><![CDATA[A bold hypothesis. What about now? ]]></string>
<string id="539720"><![CDATA[I suspect that he tried to bury the pest in the Steppe not so long ago. I have no idea why. That was the greatest sacrilege, and my father tried to intervene. He went to the Steppe to reinter this nightmarish burial ground. He must have burned it… but couldn't come out unscathed. You know how it went after that.]]></string>

<string id="539904"><![CDATA[Ah! Yes, there was a madman here. Barged in shouting that his brother was innocent, that they're twins, that is was he who attacked the flamethrower corps. I've pardonned him because I have already been informed of the unauthorized actions of said corps. His actions were justified.]]></string>
<string id="539905"><![CDATA[So are your soldiers disobeying you then? They're surprisingly quick to issue orders…]]></string>
<string id="539908"><![CDATA[So it was he who told you about the mutineers? ]]></string>
<string id="539909"><![CDATA[I was there when he himself was informed about them. That is what saved me. I rushed to the cannon, started asking questions about an executed architect. They said they've arrested a lot of rabble—to execute at dawn. And then they offered special treatment to me—I barely escaped with a whole skin.]]></string>
<string id="539910"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="539911"><![CDATA[Then I rushed to the pub to find reinforcements and assault the cannon. That's where it gets stupid. It seems that I've raised so much noise by the cannon that they've made special inquires about me. They've sent a squad to the den…]]></string>
<string id="539912"><![CDATA[Okay, I know what happened next. How did you manage to break free? ]]></string>
<string id="539913"><![CDATA[My faithful comrades have won me back. On our way here they told me that Peter came home and was sleeping like a log. I made sure it's true—and then I came back here to count my losses…]]></string>
<string id="539914"><![CDATA[Talk ahead then. Wait... Don't you want to know what happened to me at all? ]]></string>
<string id="539915"><![CDATA[No. I want to know how you installed the Polyhedron. It was you, wasn't it?]]></string>
<string id="539916"><![CDATA[And what could have happened to you apart from more senseless lunacy? ]]></string>
<string id="539917"><![CDATA[I see.]]></string>
<string id="539918"><![CDATA[There's also a rumour that Andrey Stamatin, the architect that had murdered every soldier in his studio yesterday and set fire to a stone stairway later, was just executed by the mutineers. That's when the assault began. What is that supposed to mean?]]></string>
<string id="539919"><![CDATA[That was me.]]></string>
<string id="539920"><![CDATA[So I am you! The furnace of this catastrophe has molded me, my brother, and you into a single person… The fire of war has molded us into a threefold bullet. It's natural. We are one. The three sides of a single process. Come to the Capital with us!]]></string>
<string id="539921"><![CDATA[Wait a minute... I think I've heard that already somewhere. Déjà vu... ]]></string>
<string id="539922"><![CDATA[Really? Well, it's no wonder another smart person has pointed out the obvious to you.]]></string>
<string id="539923"><![CDATA[Wait, it's too early to celebrate yet. Show me the design of the Tower's foundation.]]></string>
<string id="539924"><![CDATA[Peace, Andrey. Remember what I had to suffer through for your sake today…]]></string>
<string id="539925"><![CDATA[It's not enough for me to have a look; I want to borrow them.]]></string>
<string id="539926"><![CDATA[BONE HORN. Bos Primigenius, a beast from legend whose lines reflect all the intricacies and laws of the Universe, gave this bone to one of the first menkhu.]]></string>
<string id="539927"><![CDATA[The truth and you are incompatible concepts! ]]></string>
<string id="539928"><![CDATA[So the Changeling hasn't deceived me after all… and I thought she was the main source of all lies!]]></string>
<string id="539929"><![CDATA[Aglaya, how could you do this? This is an honest to God betrayal. I trusted you… ]]></string>
<string id="539930"><![CDATA[What were you expecting? You seem to be overstepping your bounds, my dear… You are nothing but an individual, a bachelor of some sciences or arts; I, on the other hand, am an Inquisitor. People like you only exist to allow people like me to achieve their personal goals.]]></string>
<string id="539931"><![CDATA[Personal! Not the goals handed down to you!]]></string>
<string id="539932"><![CDATA[Really, Dankovsky... Stop with the infantilism. You want to get back at the Powers That Be? So do I. And the best way to get even with them is to take their precious toy away. Or better yet, to turn it into ordinary utility equipment. That would be elegant and just.]]></string>
<string id="539933"><![CDATA[So you assume that our goals coincide? ]]></string>
<string id="539934"><![CDATA[No. I do not want to take revenge on the Powers That Be anymore. I want to take revenge on you, Aglaya. And I swear it'll work out perfectly!]]></string>
<string id="539935"><![CDATA[I wonder how.]]></string>
<string id="539936"><![CDATA[You are powerless, Aglaya. And I am powerful. Because, heaven be praised, the Commander knows how to tell truth from lies. Whatever moves you make, he'll listen to me. So… ]]></string>
<string id="539937"><![CDATA[I think you are right. This is exactly what I was expecting. I won't bid you farewell—I haven't made my final move yet.]]></string>
<string id="539938"><![CDATA[So you are going to alter the truth to have a farewell jab at me? To preserve this diabolical Tower and raze the Settlement to the ground? Is that so? You are a hypocrite, Dankovsky… You won't have any self-respect after this.]]></string>
<string id="539939"><![CDATA[We'll see.]]></string>
<string id="539940"><![CDATA[I am sure of it. I hope the next day shows you without a shadow of a doubt that I am right. Remember how you've been managed all this time… and how blind you would have been, have I not opened your eyes to the truth you hold so dear. As for how I've used your epiphany... well, that's my business.]]></string>
<string id="539941"><![CDATA[Damn you to hell, Inquisitor. ]]></string>
<string id="539942"><![CDATA[Oh, no. That is my business.]]></string>
<string id="539943"><![CDATA[You still do not realise who your true foe is, Dankovsky. We restore the mechanics of the Universe, you and I. We have built a logical chain of events and consequences. You swore to destroy the enemy and to be just. I gave you a chance to keep your word. A chance to win. And here's your gratitude...]]></string>
<string id="539944"><![CDATA[No. Now I realise who my true foe is perfectly well.]]></string>
<string id="539945"><![CDATA[Hey! I can hear something in your voice… are those tears? Or is that how you laugh?]]></string>
<string id="539946"><![CDATA[What is a utopia, Aglaya? Let's talk for the last time. What is provoking your hatred so much?]]></string>
<string id="539947"><![CDATA[I am a humanitarian. My duty is to save people, not kill them. I only condemn a few to death for the sake of the many. Now I'm offering you to save the happiness of several thousands hardly shedding any blood at all. A utopia will demand more and more sacrifices, you know. Even this Utopia.]]></string>
<string id="539948"><![CDATA[It's not your place to talk good and evil, Inquisitor. Stay here and watch me change the world.]]></string>
<string id="539949"><![CDATA[But why do you think this place is a utopia? Nobody conducts social experiments here. Look, this place is more natural than nature. ]]></string>
<string id="539950"><![CDATA[Utopias are usually constructed to embody perfect justice, liberty, or economical thrift. This one, however, is different. This town is not a "place that does not exist"; it's a "place that cannot exist". Mustn't exist. Here's where the cause and the source are the same.]]></string>
<string id="539951"><![CDATA[You're a bore, Aglaya Lilich. I'm tired of your pathos. ]]></string>
<string id="539952"><![CDATA[Do elaborate on that, please. I'm still failing to understand where you see the root of all evil.]]></string>
<string id="539953"><![CDATA[What does this shabby town have to do with it? Aren't you overselling it by calling it a utopia?]]></string>
<string id="539954"><![CDATA[I need to speak to Alexander Block. He's here. ]]></string>
<string id="539955"><![CDATA[Here? No. He will only arrive at seven o'clock in the evening, a person of exemplary punctuality and honour that he is! ]]></string>
<string id="539956"><![CDATA[What powers? ]]></string>
<string id="539957"><![CDATA[You'll find that out if every person whose life had been in your hands for the last twelve days has a chance to say a word before the council. Every single Bound person.]]></string>
<string id="539958"><![CDATA[Some of them deserve death. ]]></string>
<string id="539959"><![CDATA[Undoubtedly. It has nothing to do with morals—it's about whether or not they will be able to speak up by the time this town's fate is decided. History loves to connect human lives into chains. Misplace one link—and the whole chain is broken.]]></string>
<string id="539960"><![CDATA[Why should the powers that block my the entrance to the Cathedral care about these people? ]]></string>
<string id="539961"><![CDATA[You are too inquisitive, my dearest Bachelor! You don't have to worry about higher powers. You don't have to know why it had all been arranged like this. Who dies, dies. Do your deed. If you want to be present at the Council, fulfill your obligations.]]></string>
<string id="539962"><![CDATA[What obligations are you talking about, you creature in a beast mask?]]></string>
<string id="539963"><![CDATA[There are a few lives that you personally are responsible for. If these people are safe and sound by the evening, you will be allowed access to the Council. You will have a chance to tell Aglaya Lilich what you think of her.]]></string>
<string id="539965"><![CDATA[There is no particular need in that... ]]></string>
<string id="539966"><![CDATA[Yes. I am extremely inquisitive. ]]></string>
<string id="539968"><![CDATA[By the evening all of them will be well. ]]></string>
<string id="539969"><![CDATA[Let it be so. ]]></string>
<string id="539970"><![CDATA[I never gave my consent to be in charge of anyone!]]></string>
<string id="539971"><![CDATA[Wrong. Even if that is your opinion, your conscience must think otherwise. Were you aware that they depend on you? You were. Could you have kept them away from harm? Absolutely. Have you been notified in advance that this is how it's going to end? Definitely. Which means...?]]></string>
<string id="539972"><![CDATA[Is it still possible to remedy the situation? ]]></string>
<string id="539973"><![CDATA[There's very little time left. Burakh has produced several portions of his concoction. Some people may still have shmowders left; some may have shmowders. If you're one of those lucky few, then good for you! You're welcome to make the round. Offer the medicine to the vulture-faced corpsebringers standing watch by the doors, waiting to hear the owners' last breath... All is not lost yet.]]></string>
<string id="539974"><![CDATA[Wait for me. ]]></string>
<string id="539975"><![CDATA[I know what it means without your help.]]></string>
<string id="539976"><![CDATA[How many people would you like me to bring to life?]]></string>
<string id="539977"><![CDATA["Would like to"? Us? He must be having a laugh at our expence! We would like nothing. What I find surprising is that you wouldn't like it all that much either, Bachelor! And it's not about "how many", it's about "which ones exactly"; although you must know the answer to that question well enough!]]></string>
<string id="539978"><![CDATA[What if I don't?]]></string>
<string id="539979"><![CDATA[Then you're not as smart as everyone's been portraying you to be all this time… But don't be sad. You won’t need do be smart inside. The only thing that matters to the Inquisitor is sheer resolve, and the Commander is all about emotions now.]]></string>
<string id="539980"><![CDATA[Which people exacly should stay alive?]]></string>
<string id="539981"><![CDATA[The people who you had been charged with protecting. The people whose fates you have without second thoughts taken into your own hands afterwards. Rings a bell? Aren't you keeping the list of all those people in a chest pocked, close to the heart? Or in that clumsy carpet bag of your? I wonder what it's stuffed with—I've always been curious and never had a chance to ask...]]></string>
<string id="539982"><![CDATA[The cheeks of cheeky guys and arses of smartarses. Like you.]]></string>
<string id="539983"><![CDATA[I get it.]]></string>
<string id="539984"><![CDATA[All right. Wait for me. ]]></string>
<string id="539985"><![CDATA[We are not going to wait for too long though. Time is in short supply. You have until ten o'clock.]]></string>
<string id="539986"><![CDATA[Damn it! ]]></string>
<string id="539987"><![CDATA[Then let me see the Inquisitor. We have a lot to talk about before the Council begins.]]></string>
<string id="539988"><![CDATA[No, Bachelor. You will meet them at seven o'clock and not a minute earlier. New powers have come into play now—the powers that even a government Inquisitor cannot oppose. We are only doing their bidding.]]></string>
<string id="539989"><![CDATA[But Eva's dead…]]></string>
<string id="539990"><![CDATA[She, apparently, does not think so. This unfortunate girl is the only friend of yours that has really done something for you. You won't ever have to take care of her now, yet her voice will be heard. She pleaded and spoke for you.]]></string>
<string id="539991"><![CDATA[...And the others? ]]></string>
<string id="539992"><![CDATA[So that's what her letter was about… ]]></string>
<string id="539993"><![CDATA[How about I pull your nose, Executor? You won't have a chance to strike back, after all. You have no hands.]]></string>
<string id="539994"><![CDATA[Do I hear laughter from under your ugly beak?]]></string>
<string id="539995"><![CDATA[Funny... Now everything will be decided. The Inquisitor lass seems to think she has used you. Confused? Don't you fret! She's also nothing. Everything was leading to this. You are now acting in the interest of inevitability. You can't get away from it. Evil conquers all.]]></string>
<string id="539997"><![CDATA[I laugh at you, person in a mask. ]]></string>
<string id="539998"><![CDATA[In my opinion, there is a plot against the Inquisitor. I do not want to become the weapon raised against her by the hands even more devious…]]></string>
<string id="539999"><![CDATA[Are you talking about Clara?]]></string>
<string id="540000"><![CDATA[Yes. About the Changeling.]]></string>
<string id="540001"><![CDATA[Clara the saint? No. The thought never even occurred to me. ]]></string>
<string id="540002"><![CDATA[Live, Andrey. Keep a close eye on Peter. You'd become desperate and turn into a villain without him.]]></string>
<string id="540003"><![CDATA[Live, Judge. Live for as long as you need to execute your decision.]]></string>
<string id="540004"><![CDATA[Farewell, puppeteer. Best of luck in your creative endeavours. …Is that how my line is supposed to sound, right?]]></string>
<string id="540005"><![CDATA[Live, Vlad. I think you'll make an ideal husband to Maria. It was obvious that the Kains and the Olgimskys were supposed to unite one day.]]></string>
<string id="540006"><![CDATA[Live, Peter. Work and dream. Hold Andrey's hand—or he may do something bad... ]]></string>
<string id="540007"><![CDATA[Looking at you frightens me. It seems to me like an unimaginable creature living in a star-filled abyss looks at me back through Victor's eyes...]]></string>
<string id="540014"><![CDATA[Let the Settlement be destroyed. But don't fire at the tower of glass. It must survive the tremor of an artillery barrage.]]></string>
<string id="540015"><![CDATA[I'm surprised to hear that from you… How can you prove that it's a wise direction to take?]]></string>
<string id="540016"><![CDATA[Bachelor will. I trust him. And I know nothing about the Tower except that it contains the life that my father has instructed me to preserve.]]></string>
<string id="540017"><![CDATA[We will now be talking to you, Bachelor Dankovsky. Artemy Burakh! Are you sure that you have nothing more to tell me?]]></string>
<string id="540018"><![CDATA[I am sure, general. I've made my choice.]]></string>
<string id="540019"><![CDATA[Let the Settlement be destroyed, but there's no reason to hurt the Polyhedron. The survivors will find shelter there until we vaccinate them and the epidemic dies out.]]></string>
<string id="540020"><![CDATA[So you think that the town is doomed? ]]></string>
<string id="540021"><![CDATA[I do. The soil underneath it is soaked with poison. We're very lucky that the ground here is so fastidious. Plough every inch of it up with shells, shake it and pull its rocks out, split it into cracks so that no one would ever dare re-inhabit this land. This side of the river is uninhabitable.]]></string>
<string id="540022"><![CDATA[I see. And you believe that the Tower will make it through the bombardment despite its base being so thin?]]></string>
<string id="540023"><![CDATA[Yes. The tower must keep its balance. I've studied its structure and I'm inclined to believe that it's rather earthquake-resistant. It's like a weight on a steel spring. If no shell explodes on the opposite bank of the river, the Polyhedron will remain intact. ]]></string>
<string id="540024"><![CDATA[Shells will only fall where I point them to fall.]]></string>
<string id="540025"><![CDATA[Let it be so then.]]></string>
<string id="540026"><![CDATA[How do you prove that this choice is sensible?]]></string>
<string id="540027"><![CDATA[Here are my arguments. The panacea; the evidence of an underground blood deposit that feeds the town; my rightful and supported claim to take this blood.]]></string>
<string id="540028"><![CDATA[Come see me at the Crucible, Daniil... I am expiring fast, I can barely hold the pen with which I'm writing this... My voice will fail me soon. I want to see you one last time.

Maria]]></string>
<string id="540029"><![CDATA[A Message from Maria]]></string>
<string id="540030"><![CDATA[*** This is out of the question. These are merely unarmed townsfolk. If I set the soldiers at them then it will be a massacre! I'd rather they make a commotion for a while and go home unharmed.]]></string>
<string id="540031"><![CDATA[A disturbing letter has arrived from Victor Kain. It seems there is a storm gathering over the Crucible. Since he's phrasing it so, I probably shouldn't ignore Victor's request.]]></string>
<string id="540032"><![CDATA[I have found Burakh and relayed your request to him.]]></string>
<string id="540033"><![CDATA[...What did he say?]]></string>
<string id="540034"><![CDATA[He said he has nothing to tell you for now. He's going underground, drawn by the echoes of some events connected to his father's death.]]></string>
<string id="540035"><![CDATA[Ah, how untimely… We might have to resort to using a blind pawn. Yes, I'll give that Changeling a chance… It could go well. I am grateful to you, Dankovsky, and deeply indebted. My errand must have cost you dearly.]]></string>
<string id="540036"><![CDATA[Obviously. I'm almost broke.]]></string>
<string id="540037"><![CDATA[Well, it cost more to those who were getting in my way.]]></string>
<string id="540038"><![CDATA[I won't go down without a fight, you lowlives! ]]></string>
<string id="540039"><![CDATA[What makes you think that? We'd love to shoot you—whoever you are. Thirty people have walked this path today already; two of them have bought the return ticket though. We only accept panacea. Here it is, see? I'm keeping it close to the heart. So what, lucky guy, got a panacea?]]></string>
<string id="540040"><![CDATA[I do. Take it and let me go in peace... ]]></string>
<string id="540041"><![CDATA[I'm actually quite intrigued by your own vial…]]></string>
<string id="540042"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="540043"><![CDATA[Oh, it was so scary… You got out, right? So you're not mine yet…]]></string>
<string id="540044"><![CDATA[No, no, sweetheart... I am not yours yet... ]]></string>
<string id="540045"><![CDATA[Listen, I can't feel my legs, and my lungs are heavy... Could you please take a closer look at me?]]></string>
<string id="540046"><![CDATA[You are all covered in bullet holes... How did you survive? This cannot be... ]]></string>
<string id="540047"><![CDATA[Oh... Where are the soldiers? Have they left? ]]></string>
<string id="540048"><![CDATA[No, no, they're there—smoking by the fence... Can't you hear them talk and laugh? ]]></string>
<string id="540049"><![CDATA[No... I hear nothing, my ears are bursting... I can hardly hear you… Do you have bandages? I need to have my wounds dressed…]]></string>
<string id="540050"><![CDATA[I do, I do! We're so very much in luck today—I've just gotten some new ones to tend to the people from Andrey's den, and I do have some left… Many people were killed there, you know, and some of them came here…]]></string>
<string id="540051"><![CDATA[What people... from the den…? Who was killed there? ]]></string>
<string id="540052"><![CDATA[Do you have... weapons? ]]></string>
<string id="540053"><![CDATA[There was a terrible fight... First they were attacked, five were killed, two were wounded. Then they got together, there was an awful lot of them—and they went somewhere… And came back with Andrey. They brought two people dead and seven wounded... That's who I tended to.]]></string>
<string id="540054"><![CDATA[I see… So he managed to get away with it… Do you have any weapons?]]></string>
<string id="540056"><![CDATA[They've taken everything from me... I've got nothing left…]]></string>
<string id="540057"><![CDATA[Here, I have something I took from the wounded, they forgot it here... See, a carving knife and small tourniquets... I also have cotton wool and lint... ]]></string>
<string id="540058"><![CDATA[No need for the... cotton wool and lint... Give me the knife! ]]></string>
<string id="540059"><![CDATA[Give me everything! So you're saying they're smoking behind the wall, huh... ]]></string>
<string id="540060"><![CDATA[...I feel like a punctured tank, I'm bloody leaking… And my head… Damn it!]]></string>
<string id="540061"><![CDATA["The Messenger"]]></string>
<string id="540062"><![CDATA[The Haruspex buries himself deeper into the body of the town. It makes Aglaya nervous, wondering as to how the messenger is doing. This is convenient. I will ask him to do what I could not; to see if there is some kind of wormhole down below, where these horned bacteria may thrive.]]></string>
<string id="540063"><![CDATA[Haruspex is determined to carry on. He wants to be left alone and says he will notify me himself. All for the best; I'd rather return to my own research, without him prowling around. Why did he give the Inquisitor the attitude though? Would he be as daring if she was stood right there next to him?]]></string>
<string id="540064"><![CDATA[*** Burakh went deep. On the one hand, I hope he emerges with some useful data. On the other, I would be the last man to mourn him if he does not.]]></string>
<string id="540065"><![CDATA[Apparently, Andrey did not manage to get to the firing squad before me. They took me for him, which means they won't be bothering him any further. I wonder where he is, though... Perhaps someone in the twyrine shebeen would know.]]></string>
<string id="540066"><![CDATA[Apparently, Andrey did not manage to get to the firing squad before me. They took me for him, which means they won't be bothering him any further. I wonder where he is, though... Perhaps someone in the twyrine shebeen would know.]]></string>
<string id="540067"><![CDATA[No, no, you're right…]]></string>
<string id="540068"><![CDATA[The young lady Olgimsky probably has the most untainted view of whatever is going on inside that mysterious Tower on the Other Side. I'll ask her.]]></string>
<string id="540072"><![CDATA[I would destroy the Polyhedron. This is the price that has to be paid for procuring enough raw material to create tons of panacea. I would keep the Settlement, of course; an abandoned dangerous place is a hundredfold worse than an inhabited one that's ruled with resolve.]]></string>
<string id="540073"><![CDATA[So you would demolish the Polyhedron... That's your price for saving the town. But how would this powder keg of a settlement be ruled?]]></string>
<string id="540074"><![CDATA[I would tackle the hardest task myself, ruling the dome that's covering the depths. The living part that has a protective crust I'd pass over to the new generation of rulers brought up by Capella. If another outbreak ever happens… we'll have enough panacea to nip the epidemic in the bud.]]></string>
<string id="540075"><![CDATA[I suppose I could help them.]]></string>
<string id="540076"><![CDATA[Really? Then I could present the Commander with arguments in favour of a proposal that will preserve the town at the cost of destroying the Tower. This is a wise arrangement, and—as my heart tells me—a lasting one. I'm thinking about the future of my community.]]></string>
<string id="540077"><![CDATA[What do you need for that?]]></string>
<string id="540084"><![CDATA[Sounds right.]]></string>
<string id="540085"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="540086"><![CDATA[Because I have to take care of several children—my confidants, that are to rebuild the Settlement and turn their lives to become the angles of its foundation.]]></string>
<string id="540087"><![CDATA[So you still hope to make the Settlement suitable for life? ]]></string>
<string id="540088"><![CDATA[The next generation of rulers? You mean your bound children?]]></string>
<string id="540089"><![CDATA[Yes, exactly. Olgimskaya has marked them, and her mark is not of this world. She is never wrong. Say; if you took it upon yourself to take care of them, I'd have the time to prepare my arguments before evening and could attended the Council well-prepared. But Changeling has ruined them... and now some of them are dying.]]></string>
<string id="540090"><![CDATA[So your Bound are children?]]></string>
<string id="540108"><![CDATA[Is that where they are? I'd like to pay a visit, then. ]]></string>
<string id="540109"><![CDATA[Too late. Nothing can be changed at this point. You can't leave until you make a decision. Don't regret that you never saw them. Some day I will tell you everything… won't be able to show you, though.]]></string>

<string id="540114"><![CDATA[If the Town is destroyed, that spells her doom as well. I could have killed her by giving the Bachelor the right to decide. I know what he would have done.]]></string>
<string id="540115"><![CDATA[So what? You don't want to do this?]]></string>
<string id="540116"><![CDATA[No. I would've told you if I did.]]></string>
<string id="540117"><![CDATA[So you've lost?]]></string>
<string id="540118"><![CDATA[No, I haven't. There's another way we can procure blood. Tear the Tower down.]]></string>
<string id="540119"><![CDATA[I'll try to do something. How can I recognise your confidants?]]></string>
<string id="540120"><![CDATA[I wrote to you about them the other day. But in case you lost that letter, I'll tell you how to spot them. They all want one thing, and that's to preserve the marvellous Tower. Nothing else matters to them.]]></string>
<string id="540121"><![CDATA[I'll do my best to help you. How do I recognize your Bound?]]></string>
<string id="540122"><![CDATA[All of them are listed in the letter that I sent to you several days ago. And… they're easily recognizable. The persecuted, the outcasts, the villains, the criminals… those whose only shelter is me, the new Mistress!]]></string>
<string id="540123"><![CDATA[How will they paint it?]]></string>
<string id="540124"><![CDATA[Anew, Warden. The triangle this town was standing on is going. There will be no more Utopian Scarlet, Termite Navy, Humble Taupe. There will be gold, amber, lilac, malachite, black, and dawnish beige.]]></string>
<string id="540125"><![CDATA[I hope you explain the meaning of these colours to me one day.]]></string>
<string id="540126"><![CDATA[Yours will be charcoal. Don't be distressed, it has its own beauty. But its role is different. Along with my white it will be used when mixing colours to receive various tints.]]></string>
<string id="540127"><![CDATA[And the others? What colours will you assign to them?]]></string>
<string id="540128"><![CDATA[That's beautiful. This palette is more robust than the previous one.]]></string>
<string id="540129"><![CDATA[I never thought you were superstitious. ]]></string>
<string id="540130"><![CDATA[I am already becoming the Scarlet Mistress, Burakh! Even if I were the last living creature on this earth, surrounded by barren desert; even then I would have become one. It's not within your power to stop this.]]></string>
<string id="540131"><![CDATA[Then at least do not regret your most precious thing. The Polyhedron will be razed to dust in a few hours.]]></string>
<string id="540132"><![CDATA[I respectfully bow before a new Mistress…]]></string>
<string id="540133"><![CDATA[The twinkle in your eye betrays the truth. You made him do it!]]></string>
<string id="540134"><![CDATA[You are indeed the blood-red queen… I shudder at the mental image of your hypothetic reign—and the rivers of blood you are intending to spill.]]></string>
<string id="540135"><![CDATA[Well, as for me, I'm totally fine with the Bachelor's choice.]]></string>
<string id="540136"><![CDATA[Then pay a visit to Maria, the Scarlet Mistress, the one whose ascension your dear Bachelor is looking to ensure. Go to her after giving up your right to make the choice; go—she's daydreaming still! She won't stoop to hiding her real intentions from you; she's absolutely convinced that puny insignificant babies like Victoria or me can do nothing to get in her way.]]></string>
<string id="540137"><![CDATA[Is she now? I think I will indeed pay her a visit…]]></string>
<string id="540138"><![CDATA[Farewell, Simon. I've found you at last… sir.]]></string>
<string id="540139"><![CDATA[I've already done what I wanted. My life expectancy was low anyway. Why should I stretch my last days, accumulate diseases and grow to become a burden for my relatives? No... the best thing I can do now is to give way to my niece.]]></string>
<string id="540140"><![CDATA[I have finally realized what my part is, you know. I'm good at breaking through to where no one is supposed to. And I'm really good at breaking rules, at challenging and contradicting. But I have no idea how to build something…]]></string>
<string id="540141"><![CDATA[I'm seeing you for the last time today.]]></string>
<string id="540142"><![CDATA[The Polyhedron will become for the new town what the Abattoir used to be for the old one. A hub, a nursing organ, a source of vital power, and the origin of its history. ]]></string>
<string id="540143"><![CDATA[How is it possible?]]></string>
<string id="540144"><![CDATA[Isn't it too fragile to become a foundation?]]></string>
<string id="540145"><![CDATA[It is a prism. It will refract sunrays, focussing them and inseminating the other bank of the river with its blessed warmth. It will all be about the solar cycle. The spots will shift and move following the laws of every calendar.]]></string>
<string id="540146"><![CDATA[Your design is thought through in detail, as I can see.]]></string>
<string id="540147"><![CDATA[Oh, no... I am not a geometrician; arithmetics is not my element either. But everything I'm describing is in my plain sight. I had enough time to fall in love with my design. I will heat up the new town with my rampant passion while it's being built. It will take years. But I'll bring it to life in the end.]]></string>
<string id="540148"><![CDATA[What will your new town be like?]]></string>
<string id="540149"><![CDATA[We will build it so that various points of its space would awaken inaccessible and unexplored ideas and feelings in those who come there. We'll lay routes so that anyone following them would end up becoming a different person after reaching their destination.]]></string>
<string id="540150"><![CDATA[Are you going to remove the children from the Polyhedron? What will happen to it?]]></string>
<string id="540151"><![CDATA[You will inform them beforehand, of course, won't you?]]></string>
<string id="540153"><![CDATA[It's not about manipulation at all! Everything that can be discovered will be discovered. Everyone who takes to the road is free.]]></string>
<string id="540154"><![CDATA[For example?]]></string>
<string id="540155"><![CDATA[The Polyhedron, the beginning and the starting point of the new town, can accumulate childhood and its own magic. Routes, space, and structures that will stretch from the Polyhedron will be able to ignite other flames in people who have left the Tower...]]></string>
<string id="540156"><![CDATA[Can it all be truly possible? Can you really do it?]]></string>
<string id="540157"><![CDATA[Can it all be truly possible? Can you really do it?]]></string>
<string id="540158"><![CDATA[I am not alone. Moreover... I am not showing you my real power. You're leaving today, aren't you? So remember me for who I was. Remember me not as the Scarlet Mistress, able to grab your life, ignite you, and drag your whole being along, but as a girl with her life hanging by a thread.]]></string>
<string id="540159"><![CDATA[Don't forget that your destiny hasn't been determined yet. It is still hanging by a thread.]]></string>
<string id="540160"><![CDATA[Who told you I'm leaving? I am staying here.]]></string>
<string id="540161"><![CDATA[Perhaps I'll come back here one day. I surely will if I don't forget the way.]]></string>
<string id="540162"><![CDATA[What is there not to get, oh esteemed and wisest of bachelors?]]></string>
<string id="540163"><![CDATA[You were a puppeteer. Your Masks foretold our future—or maybe they imposed it upon us; in all honesty, I don't see the difference. All this time I was absolutely positive you were connected to the plague.]]></string>
<string id="540164"><![CDATA[I thought that the whole point of the Utopians' ideology was neglecting the laws of fate and the limits it imposes upon us.]]></string>
<string id="540165"><![CDATA[You are correct, oh the keenest of the astute! So what? I have cognized this side of Existence from backstage, so to speak; from where the strings go and the machinery is hidden—and yet I willingly swore allegiance to the Utopia. Does that tell you nothing?]]></string>
<string id="540166"><![CDATA[It doesn't tell me enough. You are, as always, a double-dealer...]]></string>
<string id="540167"><![CDATA[I don't believe you've changed. And you being with them is fearsome to me. You are an alarming tone in the jubilant orchestra of creators. ]]></string>
<string id="540168"><![CDATA[Pff… You know, I'm glad you're leaving. You are a dangerous person, dealing with you would be and arduous task...]]></string>
<string id="540169"><![CDATA[You're back to being annoyed already? And I was just planning to ask as to what you're going to do with your life.]]></string>
<string id="540170"><![CDATA[Me? Hahaha… That's ridiculous! And it's very tactless of you to ask me a question like that! Oh no, no offence taken... by me; you haven't offended me, after all—you've offended the Scarlet Mistress herself. My life belongs to Maria now… And I am merely her humble servant… always at her service.]]></string>
<string id="540171"><![CDATA[I know who you are! You are the devil... Well, seems like you can't be done without. Especially with the Utopians.]]></string>
<string id="540172"><![CDATA[You know, I've just realized why you haven't been infected even once... You've never been among my volunteers! ]]></string>
<string id="540173"><![CDATA[Yeah, well... That was an unexpected turn of events—even for myself. It all happened very fast. The last few days, I mean.]]></string>
<string id="540174"><![CDATA[You were such a loyal son... I was sure you were to follow in your father's footsteps.]]></string>
<string id="540175"><![CDATA[But you are an abhorrent criminal... You have sentenced several thousands people to death. Their blood is on your hands.]]></string>
<string id="540176"><![CDATA[I am still a loyal son. Who told you I was denying my family's values and power? That's like genes—one cannot change them. Even if I abjured the ideas my father believed in, I cannot abjure his lines... But that's Steppe knowledge... Burakh could tell you all about that.]]></string>
<string id="540177"><![CDATA[Yes, that's true. So what? I would be an even worse criminal if, having known of the impending epidemic, I wouldn't have taken urgent steps, but rather allowed the infected rabble enter the town. There was a hope that the disease would burn out if we board it off—just like five years ago. That's just the role I had to play. ]]></string>
<string id="540178"><![CDATA[Your father... Do you want to be like him?]]></string>
<string id="540179"><![CDATA[He is a boös, a bullman and a master of bulls. He is a man of primeval age; of the age that has long sunk into oblivion. He was born by the very damp and dense epoch that gave birth to the Kin and its values. I respect him and... I love him. You can see what he's done for me. But the age of aurochses and bisons has irretrievably ended.]]></string>
<string id="540180"><![CDATA[What are you going to do now? ]]></string>
<string id="540181"><![CDATA[I'm worried that a man like you—the one who was dealed this very role and played it all too easily—is suddenly among the Utopians!]]></string>
<string id="540182"><![CDATA[There might be a higher purpose to that, you know. After all, Nina the Wild never held human lives in high regard…]]></string>
<string id="540183"><![CDATA[What are you going to do now? ]]></string>
<string id="540184"><![CDATA[I'll serve Maria. I'll be her hands. Her practical mind. I'll be her accountant and her chancellor. I'll estimate the price of her ideas and outbursts and I'll estimate the price of her every dream. You know, it happens—some business-like people are also surprisingly mad.]]></string>
<string id="540185"><![CDATA[Yes. I know. ]]></string>
<string id="540186"><![CDATA[Well... You have surprised me, Olgimsky. Farewell.]]></string>
<string id="540187"><![CDATA[Here's what's going to happen. The part of the town on this bank of the river will be deserted. The people who will have found shelter in the specular cocoon will become its new inhabitants. ]]></string>
<string id="540188"><![CDATA[What are you going to build? ]]></string>
<string id="540189"><![CDATA[My brother and I will build the whole town. The Cold Hall will look like a mudpie in a sandbox compared to it.  I've designed it in my mind already.]]></string>
<string id="540190"><![CDATA[Really? Tell me. ]]></string>
<string id="540191"><![CDATA[That was an effulgent epiphany, a true eureka moment. My brother and I have planned the space already. We have laid roads, placed suburbs and districts... And when we saw the whole thing and realized how much energy was hiding in it... you know, we exchanged glances. It will rival the cities of the greatest ancient civilizations! ]]></string>
<string id="540192"><![CDATA[When did you do that? ]]></string>
<string id="540193"><![CDATA[So I've made the right choice after all... You alone are worth bringing a gang of criminals and scoundrels into power.]]></string>
<string id="540194"><![CDATA[That town of yours will only exist on paper... Like with the Polyhedron, it will turn into a full-sized model of itself—made of its own designs…]]></string>
<string id="540195"><![CDATA[You're wrong. But why should I prove anything to you? Time will tell.]]></string>
<string id="540196"><![CDATA[All right. I hope you will stop sinking in the green whirlpool. The herb is pulling you to the bottom already. There is neither warmth nor light there. ]]></string>
<string id="540197"><![CDATA[It's simple. I won't be staying here long. When everything is finished and I make sure that my daughter has become the Scarlet Mistress, I'll relocate to Focus. I belong there. ]]></string>
<string id="540198"><![CDATA[But if the town is destroyed, the Crucible will be razed, too. Only splinters and heaps of dead stones will remain here. ]]></string>
<string id="540199"><![CDATA[The vial that Burakh gave me is strangely heavy and warm to the touch. I wonder what is inside? I need to study the contents under the microscope immediately.]]></string>
<string id="540200"><![CDATA[What an interesting blood sample... I need to talk to Burakh about it!]]></string>
<string id="540201"><![CDATA[The gift wasn't mine to give. Don't put it like that.]]></string>
<string id="540203"><![CDATA[You are not alone, Andrey. ]]></string>
<string id="540204"><![CDATA[Exactly. There is no Andrey, only the brothers Stamatin, the twins. We are worthless without one another, and together we are worth more than any of the old school masters. For Peter's fantasies have no limits—he's too naïve for that—and I have the genuine freedom of action.]]></string>
<string id="540206"><![CDATA[Hey, hey, you keep your hands to yourself... Little doll! A litle doll smarting around!]]></string>
<string id="540207"><![CDATA[A doll? Me?]]></string>
<string id="540208"><![CDATA[Yeah... Well, you personally have grown a bit big…]]></string>
<string id="540209"><![CDATA[I'll rip your heads off.]]></string>
<string id="540210"><![CDATA[You don't conform to anything.]]></string>
<string id="540211"><![CDATA[...You are also absolutely wild. A pointless atavism, evolutionarily speaking. I've been looking for a reason to tell you this since university.]]></string>
<string id="540212"><![CDATA[You love superlative degrees too much.]]></string>
<string id="540213"><![CDATA[And this is exactly why I'll be able to implement anything invented by Peter and blessed by Maria's love. Neither death nor depth nor the Law itself will stop me. All in all, I'm staying. I love this future pyre. It makes me feel like a demiurge.]]></string>
<string id="540214"><![CDATA[I envy you, Andrey.]]></string>
<string id="540215"><![CDATA[I don't think so—I'm pretty sure we'll meet in the Capital soon enough. Your first drink will be on me.]]></string>
<string id="540216"><![CDATA[I told you already of the idea to construct a building with variable density... or was it someone else? But there is also a knot-house, there is a house that erupts from itself—an inside-out-house, so to speak, but without the "inside" part... an encircled suburb that is at war with the centre, a bridge suburb... And, of course, a growing house that changes every week... ]]></string>
<string id="540217"><![CDATA[How could you possibly invent all that? Are you really going to build all those things? ]]></string>
<string id="540218"><![CDATA[It wasn't I that have saved your life, Mark Immortell. I want everybody to hear that! I would have killed you if I could.]]></string>
<string id="540219"><![CDATA[You are fading away quickly, Judge. Life is leaving you. How much do you have left?]]></string>
<string id="540220"><![CDATA[Not much. But I do not need much. Pretty soon the spirit will find a more worthy vessel than this old body.]]></string>
<string id="540221"><![CDATA[What burden do you bear, Judge?]]></string>
<string id="540222"><![CDATA[It is a joyful burden. By taking it in I have finally found everything I used to be lacking—everything I was so jealous of in my brother! But… yes, now it's become obvious to me how much fuel these qualities require! It costs me as much energy as a week of concentration to even think about them...]]></string>
<string id="540223"><![CDATA[How long will you last, Judge?]]></string>
<string id="540224"><![CDATA[What about your spirit? What happens to you, Judge?]]></string>
<string id="540225"><![CDATA[But in reality all you do is always keep him in mind and think things he would have thought… right?]]></string>
<string id="540226"><![CDATA[Indeed, my boy. Indeed. Now let us not talk about it anymore—it disturbs my peace… and weakens me.]]></string>
<string id="540227"><![CDATA[I admire for your courage, Judge.]]></string>
<string id="540228"><![CDATA[What does my spirit matter compared to Simon's? And it is not going to stay long in the specular trap either. It's not even cozy there. When the new town is founded, Simon will dissolve in it, I'm sure.]]></string>
<string id="540229"><![CDATA[I admire for your courage, Judge.]]></string>
<string id="540230"><![CDATA[Your mind is going, Judge.]]></string>
<string id="540231"><![CDATA[You are speaking to me as if I were a gosling... I might be failing to understand something.]]></string>
<string id="540232"><![CDATA[What will happen to this place? ]]></string>
<string id="540233"><![CDATA[Here's how it's going to be. The town on this bank of the river will be deserted. A new town will be built on the other bank of Gorkhon—a town bigger, freer, and more beautiful. The people who will have found shelter in the specular cocoon will become its new inhabitants. Everything will change for the better.]]></string>
<string id="540234"><![CDATA[But Focus is not quite a place. It will survive the destruction of the town. You can how tiny these houses are... Focus is nothing more than a mere toy. And the Polyhedron will be sufficient to everybody. We'll get along well with Simon. And when a new town is designed, we'll dissolve in its features.]]></string>
<string id="540235"><![CDATA[So there will be a new town? ]]></string>
<string id="540236"><![CDATA[My mind is confused... I wish your victory hadn't been bought at a price of your madness, Victor. To tell you the truth, you are the only one here who has really gone mad...]]></string>
<string id="540237"><![CDATA[Last question... Tell me about Nina.]]></string>
<string id="540238"><![CDATA[I see. ]]></string>
<string id="540239"><![CDATA[She was a radiantly beautiful woman. A dark chestnut with an intricate hairdo. Her eyes were deep and of the colour of French plum; her features were noble. Her only failing was the tendency to blow her nostrils, but that was hardly noticeable—they were thin and tight and elegant.]]></string>
<string id="540240"><![CDATA[That's excusable. What else? ]]></string>
<string id="540241"><![CDATA[I can see now that you really loved her very much...]]></string>
<string id="540242"><![CDATA[She was carefully minding her P's and Q's. She had an imperial deportment. Nina was very tall and her waist was so thin that a man could clasp it with his two palms. She liked cinnamon and black cherry. Will that be enough?  ]]></string>
<string id="540243"><![CDATA[Thank you. That will be enough. ]]></string>
<string id="540245"><![CDATA[ANDREY STAMATIN'S BLUEPRINTS. A supplement to the Polyhedron blueprints. They describe the terrible foundation which allows the Tower to stand, defying the laws of physics and geometry. The supplement also contains all the relevant calculations.]]></string>
<string id="540246"><![CDATA[Victoria, do you know Katerina's successor?]]></string>
<string id="540247"><![CDATA[Oh, this is so very complicated... First I was absolutely positive that it was Clara. For a long time I was sure Clara was the Plague itself… I'm ashamed to admit it now that I know for sure that she is a real miracle-maker. Perhaps even a saint…]]></string>
<string id="540248"><![CDATA[So what? Can't she be Katerina's successor?]]></string>
<string id="540249"><![CDATA[Why don't you think so now? ]]></string>
<string id="540250"><![CDATA[No. A saint can't be the Mistress of Earth… I think. These ideas are incompatible. Even though she says that everything she does—even the horrible deeds—she does for the greater good… Oh, I'm so confused. Even now that I have been assured of her sainthood, she just seems... disturbing to me.]]></string>
<string id="540251"><![CDATA[Because sometimes it seems to me that there truly are two Changelings—a good one and an evil one. On the other hand, I know for sure that it cannot be so. She doesn't seem deranged to me, nor do I believe that she has split personality… All in all, it is all very weird.]]></string>
<string id="540252"><![CDATA[What bothers you about Clara? ]]></string>
<string id="540253"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="540254"><![CDATA[I am worried that she's clinging to the Commander too much. A very peculiar ally… Perhaps there's nothing bad about it. Perhaps she wants to influence him with her blessed power, to quench his cruelty… but there's something unnatural about this union.]]></string>
<string id="540255"><![CDATA[Yes, perhaps you're right. ]]></string>
<string id="540256"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="540257"><![CDATA[The sixth sense has never betrayed me. It is as though she was looking for a powerful destroyer in him. Or maybe she is just tricking him to subdue his will… In any case, I don't like it.]]></string>

<string id="540259"><![CDATA[Your Bound are alive and well. Come to the Council.]]></string>
<string id="540260"><![CDATA[Fine. I will. If you tell Block yourself that you're on my side, the Inquisitor will be disarmed.]]></string>
<string id="540261"><![CDATA[See you at the Cathedral, oynon. ]]></string>
<string id="540262"><![CDATA[No, oynon... On the other hand, I'll do just fine without you.]]></string>
<string id="540264"><![CDATA[Your confidants are alive and well. I'll be waiting for you in the Council. ]]></string>
<string id="540265"><![CDATA[If my confidants are alive, I will come to the Council with you, and there won't be a single Queen there that I won’t be able to convince to my cause! But are you absolutely sure they are alive? Do you really want me to come to the Council?]]></string>
<string id="540266"><![CDATA[Come to the Cathedral. I'll give you the right to decide. ]]></string>

<string id="540273"><![CDATA[*** Nothing keeps me from entering the Cathedral. I have a feeling, however, that the Cathedral is the real trap; not the Theatre as the warning suggested. I renounce my freedom of choice. Let someone else decide. Let it be as it may.]]></string>

<string id="540276"><![CDATA[I have come to announce my decision: there will be no decision. I forego the right do make a choice. I will not decide the town's fate and present my arguments to you.]]></string>
<string id="540278"><![CDATA[I've said everything. Farewell, commander.]]></string>
<string id="540279"><![CDATA[I have come. But I've changed my mind now. My choice is this: make this choice without me. I'm leaving.]]></string>
<string id="540280"><![CDATA[You're out of your mind, surgeon. We won't be able to make this choice without you. We are at a deadlock. The Inquisitor is holding me back. I won't let her act—it seems to me that she is plotting to laugh her last dying laugh and let the disease loose in the end. Bachelor was tricked, Clara is compromised. You are the only one left.]]></string>
<string id="540281"><![CDATA[I've said all I wanted to say. Farewell, general.]]></string>
<string id="540282"><![CDATA[Well? Are you planning to make up your mind any time soon?]]></string>
<string id="540283"><![CDATA[I would still like to know how you're going to keep the town intact.]]></string>
<string id="540284"><![CDATA[No, Bachelor! You will never understand this. You are very smart, but your intelligence holds you back. You will never come to understand my truth. Even though you're close to Maria and believe in Simon's abilities, you are still all too far from understanding the higher purpose of things. And my truth only comes together on that level...]]></string>
<string id="540285"><![CDATA[Why are you so displeased with my intelligence? ]]></string>
<string id="540286"><![CDATA[Your victory is a victory of pure reason.

<string id="540288"><![CDATA[Me and Burakh—we are different. And much more profound, believe me... Your world is mecnahically consistent and rational!

<string id="540289"><![CDATA[Are you laughing at me? I want to keep the Polyhedron! What can be less logical? ]]></string>
<string id="540290"><![CDATA[You want to keep the Polyhedron out of respect for the kindred genius who has calculated the mechanics of a miracle trap—a contraption able to capture what should not be captured! The Polyhedron is only a cold mathematical masterpiece made of glass to you! It's a very different thing to me...]]></string>
<string id="540291"><![CDATA[Look at you… it's like you're possessed by someone else.]]></string>
<string id="540292"><![CDATA[Perhaps it's not the same me you knew before. There is more than one me… a lot, perhaps. We've got the same pretty face—but who knows whose will is behind it right now?]]></string>
<string id="540293"><![CDATA[Enough. Do whatever you please... ]]></string>
<string id="540294"><![CDATA[No, I won't give you an opportunity to make a choice!]]></string>
<string id="540295"><![CDATA[I never thought you were superstitious. ]]></string>
<string id="540296"><![CDATA[Is it true that the Commander has acknowledged you as a heavenly harbinger and is now obeying your will?]]></string>
<string id="540297"><![CDATA[Would I ever have the right to be called a heavenly harbinger if I had my own will? Does the Commander serve me? Oh how stupid you are, Bachelor, when speaking of matters of this kind! The Commander is a knight. His heart is sensitive in a very unique way. He has realized who is to be served now!]]></string>
<string id="540298"><![CDATA[What is to happen to him now? I am not impartial to his fate too.]]></string>
<string id="540299"><![CDATA[Are you afraid that he will die? Don't. The Powers That Be have in fact given his an order no less hypocritical than the one you've received… He will be spared, I think. They just need to find a new battle for him. So many fires, so many abysses he is to walk through—each of them eagerly prepared by the Powers to become his grave... Yet he is to overcome all hardships... ]]></string>
<string id="540300"><![CDATA[To become a dictator and a tyrant eventually! ]]></string>
<string id="540301"><![CDATA[With your help, is what you're trying to say, right?]]></string>
<string id="540302"><![CDATA[I shall accompany him everywhere. In every campaign I shall stand by his side... And he will always know where to strike for that will not be a choice for him. Terrible and numerous will his foes be, yet his force is to become unconquerable, empowered by my spirit.]]></string>
<string id="540303"><![CDATA[So... you want to start a holy war? Under what banner? Who will believe you, Changeling…]]></string>
<string id="540304"><![CDATA[But you seemed to look at him as though he was doomed…]]></string>
<string id="540305"><![CDATA[Wait some more.]]></string>
<string id="540306"><![CDATA[Look at them. You see now that she is a victim? Do not paint her a demon. She is just honestly doing her duty—like you or me.]]></string>
<string id="540307"><![CDATA[You are protecting Aglaya. Do you really have something to say in her defence?]]></string>
<string id="540308"><![CDATA[I'm just still confused—what has she done to deceive you? Did she lie to you, has she withheld the truth? I think you've learned everything you have without her help. Every conclusion you've made is your own. The whole town was at your disposal.]]></string>
<string id="540309"><![CDATA[She had to protect the town at any cost. That was her purpose. And yet she tried to settle personal accounts with her deceased sister while claiming to fulfill a noble duty.]]></string>
<string id="540319"><![CDATA[That is true… but the point stays. I would have never become her ally, had she uncovered her true goal from the start.]]></string>
<string id="540320"><![CDATA[I've changed my mind, Burakh. I'll make the choice myself. ]]></string>
<string id="540321"><![CDATA[Then why have you brought me here? ]]></string>
<string id="540322"><![CDATA[Just in case. In case something unforeseen happens. ]]></string>
<string id="540323"><![CDATA[We have very different definitions of duty then.]]></string>
<string id="540324"><![CDATA[What is your duty, oynon? ]]></string>
<string id="540325"><![CDATA[Eradicating the infection from this world at any cost. You will see now how scrupulously I keep the promise imposed upon me from above.]]></string>
<string id="540326"><![CDATA[Well... Her duty is rescuing the town. As far as I understand, the orders she had received from the Powers That Be didn't say a single word about the necessity of keeping the Polyhedron…]]></string>
<string id="540327"><![CDATA[…The Powers That Be foresaw that that would have put her on the scent of their foul play. They must have known where the filth is coming from…]]></string>
<string id="540328"><![CDATA[She has fulfilled her duty faithfulty and literally. Just like you do. She caught them cheating. Turned their own implications and half-truths against them. So why are you reproaching her? Both of you want to break the whole to spite the Powers That Be. Both of your choices are driven by the appetite for revenge.]]></string>
<string id="540329"><![CDATA[No, Burakh. Peculiar that you're mistaken here too. I am driven by an entirely different feeling. And that feeling is love. ]]></string>
<string id="540333"><![CDATA[I have no idea who you're talking about, Burakh. There is not a single woman here fitting your description.]]></string>
<string id="540334"><![CDATA[I'm surprised to hear that from you… Can you prove that it's a sensible choice?]]></string>
<string id="540336"><![CDATA[Haruspex will. I trust him. He will speak the language of the scary tales of our long-lost childhood—the language I've forgotten already. Let him tell you of his relationship with this tribal kin. That's the recipe for saving the town, as far as I understand.]]></string>
<string id="540337"><![CDATA[Now we shall speak with you, Artemy Burakh! Bachelor Dankovsky! Are you sure there's nothing else you'd like to tell me?]]></string>
<string id="540340"><![CDATA[We won't be able to make this choice without you. We are in a deadlock. The Inquisitor is holding me back. I won't let her act—it seems to me that she is plotting to laugh her last dying laugh and let the disease loose in the end. Haruspex is acting on the Inquisitor's behalf, Clara is compromised. The town is doomed... ]]></string>
<string id="540353"><![CDATA[I will. Do you have your panacea? ]]></string>
<string id="540354"><![CDATA[No, oynon, I don't. That's the problem. I'm out of panacea. I'll have to use the last flask and the last batch of ingredients at the Council, as an argument in favour of my proposal.]]></string>
<string id="540355"><![CDATA[Are you aware that we turned out to be toys? ]]></string>
<string id="540356"><![CDATA[Really? You're kidding... Though figuratively speaking… That is true—after a fashion. We are all mere toys in the hands of Providence.]]></string>
<string id="540357"><![CDATA[No, I mean literally. You are a toy. I am a toy. We are mere dolls made of rags, sawdust, whalebone, and hell knows what else.]]></string>
<string id="540358"><![CDATA[I always knew that you were a person of refined and philosophical mind, oynon... But I never expected to hear something like this—even from you. But… sure. I can't say it bothers me all that much. The Tale of the Daughters claims that men have been made out of most inappropriate trash.]]></string>
<string id="540359"><![CDATA[We have masters. They are little kids. They are playing us right now.]]></string>
<string id="540360"><![CDATA[I hope my side wins!]]></string>
<string id="540361"><![CDATA[No. You lose. They don't love us, by the way. They're fed up with us. That's why we're stuck here… they've stuck us here.]]></string>
<string id="540362"><![CDATA[Like I said, I don't care all that much. Aglaya told me about this too, you know… She expected to stun me with the news, but I wasn't sad at all. Although I didn’t take her words that literally. But I'm honest with myself—so does it really matter what I'm made of?]]></string>
<string id="540363"><![CDATA[Well, it matters to me!]]></string>
<string id="540364"><![CDATA[You are also better-crafted than me, oynon. Take a look at us—a closer look. You are probably right about me, I'm not a toy to keep—unbending, leather-made, old, and shabby. You, on the other hand, are an entirely different thing! I'm surprised they're playing such a bad game with you...]]></string>
<string id="540365"><![CDATA[You're having fun... Somehow I fail to join in.]]></string>
<string id="540366"><![CDATA[Yes. You have boggled my mind as well, Burakh. I think I'm beginning to understand how you've managed to impress the imperial diva. We upperclass people have already become disaccustomed to such stoicism. ]]></string>
<string id="540367"><![CDATA[But I will have my revenge. Never again will they have the desire to play games of the kind… I've figured it all already.]]></string>
<string id="540368"><![CDATA[Why? You two had the same purpose—overcoming the epidemic. And don't you tell me she doesn't want it. It's a matter of principle and professional honour for her. ]]></string>
<string id="540369"><![CDATA[Her goal has been set in advance—destroying the Polyhedron. ]]></string>
<string id="540370"><![CDATA[I saw a person serving the truth just as faithfully as I do in her—but she is a turnskin.]]></string>
<string id="540371"><![CDATA[That's because she knew beforehand that the root of all misfortunes of this town lies there. Was she wrong? ]]></string>
<string id="540372"><![CDATA[I have come across new information. I truly apologize.]]></string>
<string id="540373"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="540374"><![CDATA[She came as a lightbringer capable of resolving all our misfortunes with the power of her intelligence—and ended up being a traitor that tried to sell me another lie under the guise of the ultimate truth!]]></string>
<string id="540375"><![CDATA[Yes, nothing to fault. It was executed so perfectly—not a single weak spot anywhere. But don't you see the difference? ]]></string>
<string id="540376"><![CDATA[You're just holding a grudge, oynon, nothing more. You only feel betrayed because you've entrusted yourself to her—but that was your own choice. It's unwise to brand someone a savior beforehand and then denounce them when they fail to live up to your expectations—even though they didn't know you had them.]]></string>
<string id="540377"><![CDATA[She knew. That's the difference. She knew and exploited my hopes. ]]></string>
<string id="540378"><![CDATA[You brought this on yourself. Don't try to get even with Aglaya. If you want to destroy the town and save the Tower only to get to her—and push her towards her demise… that would be unbecoming of you, oynon. It is you who will turn into a spiteful puppeteer driven by his thirst for revenge...]]></string>
<string id="540379"><![CDATA[Oh my! Look at her—she's getting closer and closer to becoming a victim of my malevolent scheming with every word you utter!]]></string>
<string id="540380"><![CDATA[She is. The feeling  that hinders you now is rage, oynon. You feel deceived because you put too much hopes in those who have been guiding you all this time. Consider the fact that Aglaya has been guiding you according to her own truth. She is a servant of the Law.]]></string>
<string id="540381"><![CDATA[It doesn't matter—she has deceived me and betrayed me. She treated me like a pawn, and I won't ever forgive her for that.]]></string>
<string id="540382"><![CDATA[Yes, you'd make an excellent lawyer. A pity she can't hear us now. ]]></string>
<string id="540383"><![CDATA[It's not about revenge. I just want to keep my word and to fulfill my mission fairly. ]]></string>
<string id="540384"><![CDATA[My duty is to find out the truth and to act in good conscience. This is what both the Powers That Be and the Inquisitor have demanded of me—yet both of them have concealed the crucial truth.]]></string>
<string id="540385"><![CDATA[Wait for me here. I shall speak to the Commander. He will call upon you soon.]]></string>
<string id="540387"><![CDATA[That's just how the world goes.]]></string>
<string id="540388"><![CDATA[The world doesn't work like you think it does. You've been taught wrong in that academia of yours. As for me, I know how to arrange it so that both the town lives and the Polyhedron stands. It will all be just like it used to be!]]></string>
<string id="540389"><![CDATA[And how will you arrange that?]]></string>
<string id="540390"><![CDATA[It's a secret. Something has to be sacrificed anyway… a lot, really… but these are things that actively want to disappear off the face of the earth. Nothing to regret about.]]></string>
<string id="540391"><![CDATA[Curious. What kind of things? ]]></string>
<string id="540392"><![CDATA[What do you care? They are but fuel that would allow to preserve the old state of being. Oh, the Powers That Be will be delighted. They really shouldn't have persecuted me! I could have offered them a wonderful gift.]]></string>
<string id="540393"><![CDATA[What's the cost?]]></string>
<string id="540394"><![CDATA[Yet another secret! Curiosity killed a cat. My word is enough. I will keep it. I am a mystical creature. I am a Mistress!]]></string>
<string id="540395"><![CDATA[Are you now?]]></string>
<string id="540396"><![CDATA[Fine, I believe you. Go ahead.]]></string>
<string id="540398"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="540399"><![CDATA[Because I want several outcast Bound to live—the ones that no one would take care of and caress but me… You have your own confidants, I have mine. I'll try to do something for them in these last few hours…]]></string>
<string id="540400"><![CDATA[Are your confidants in danger?]]></string>
<string id="540401"><![CDATA[Some of them are gravely ill. They are on the verge of death. It's partly your fault too, Bachelor... They wouldn't have fallen sick without your kind assitance, now would they?]]></string>
<string id="540402"><![CDATA[Fine. I'll check on your confidants and bring them back to life. How do I recognize them?]]></string>
<string id="540403"><![CDATA[My confidants are outcasts. Those who have accepted me as a new Mistress. They believe that I will be able to preserve the living Utopia. The town will remain the same. They will surrender their lives for that.]]></string>
<string id="540404"><![CDATA[If they live, will you come to the Cathedral? ]]></string>
<string id="540405"><![CDATA[I will.]]></string>
<string id="540407"><![CDATA[Serves them right, the villains. ]]></string>
<string id="540408"><![CDATA[So you've decided to play saint after all? Whatever…]]></string>
<string id="540413"><![CDATA[The Powers That Be… Don't you even speak about them! I've got a very particular account to settle with them!]]></string>
<string id="540414"><![CDATA[Whatever the Powers That Be claim, they don't really care about the disease. The town, the town, the town—in the precise state it's existing in now—that's their primary concern. The town whose juices flow to feed the blooming and active Polyhedron!]]></string>
<string id="540415"><![CDATA[And you think you could arrange that?]]></string>
<string id="540416"><![CDATA[I could arrange it so that everything stays the way it used to if I could get into the Cathedral and look the Inquisitor in the eye. But I can't. I have to care for my… confidants. They have put their faith in me already, you see. I cannot abandon them now.]]></string>
<string id="540417"><![CDATA[I'll do my best to help you. How do I recognize your Bound?]]></string>
<string id="540418"><![CDATA[All of them are listed in the letter that I sent to you several days ago. And… they're easily recognizable. The persecuted, the outcasts, the villains, the criminals… those whose only shelter is me, the new Mistress!]]></string>
<string id="540419"><![CDATA[Wait for me. I'll take care of your outcasts. ]]></string>
<string id="540420"><![CDATA[If my confidants are alive, I will come to the Council with you, and there won't be a single Queen there that I won’t be able to convince to my cause! But are you absolutely sure they are alive? Do you really want me to come to the Council?]]></string>
<string id="540421"><![CDATA[Yes, I am sure all your Bound are well. Come to the Cathedral. I'll give you the right to decide. ]]></string>
<string id="540422"><![CDATA[I'll think about it. Can't help the distaste I have for some of your adherents…]]></string>
<string id="540423"><![CDATA[...A chimera! A greedy, insatiable chimera. I'm so happy it's not you who is to make a choice, Changeling.]]></string>
<string id="540424"><![CDATA[Do you have a different solution?]]></string>
<string id="540429"><![CDATA[Are you aware that we're toys? ]]></string>
<string id="540430"><![CDATA[Of course I am! Were you not?]]></string>
<string id="540431"><![CDATA[I wasn't… and you're so calm about it!]]></string>
<string id="540432"><![CDATA[Lil' puppets we are, true… but it's not the puppet that matters, but whose hands control it! Have you seen them?]]></string>
<string id="540433"><![CDATA[I have. ]]></string>
<string id="540434"><![CDATA[They probably think themselves so big? Think they're real human creatures, lil' baby kids, don't they?]]></string>
<string id="540435"><![CDATA[…Aren't they?]]></string>
<string id="540436"><![CDATA[I wouldn't be so sure! I have a gut feeling about it! That's my knack, what can you do. And Haruspex is probably still thinking he's a haruspex, isn't he? Although he doesn't seem to care… He would have got on very well with those kids!]]></string>
<string id="540437"><![CDATA[I doubt that. ]]></string>
<string id="540438"><![CDATA[Tell what you know! ]]></string>
<string id="540439"><![CDATA[I have already told you everything. I don't know anything—but I sense a lot. See you, Bachelor!]]></string>
<string id="540440"><![CDATA[See you… ]]></string>
<string id="540441"><![CDATA[How long were you aware of that?]]></string>
<string id="540442"><![CDATA[I'm aware of something else, too. I am. Almost everyone we've come across in the past few days are toys—honest to God toys. But some creatures here are more intricate…]]></string>
<string id="540443"><![CDATA[Who? ]]></string>
<string id="540444"><![CDATA[You and me, for example. You surely understand quite a lot about yourself—you feel a powerful will standing behind you... And I'm going to surprise you quite a lot, tee hee… What would you have done if you knew beforehand?]]></string>
<string id="540445"><![CDATA[I would have acted more confidently.]]></string>
<string id="540446"><![CDATA[I would have shot myself.]]></string>
<string id="540447"><![CDATA[Turns out that you're a toy, Clara. And I'm a human being.]]></string>
<string id="540448"><![CDATA[Are you sure? ]]></string>
<string id="540449"><![CDATA[I am.]]></string>
<string id="540450"><![CDATA[So I'm not human. That gives me a huge advantage over you.]]></string>
<string id="540451"><![CDATA[Why? ]]></string>
<string id="540452"><![CDATA[Because you think I'm a toy. I know who you are, but you don't actually know who I am. So I have an advantage.]]></string>
<string id="540453"><![CDATA[How so? ]]></string>
<string id="540454"><![CDATA[Who were you fighting all this time? Oh you human… ]]></string>
<string id="540455"><![CDATA[The plague. ]]></string>
<string id="540456"><![CDATA[Do you realize now that you have lost? And there's nothing to be done. It's too late.]]></string>
<string id="540457"><![CDATA[All right. Let's go to the Cathedral. ]]></string>
<string id="540458"><![CDATA[I'm tired of you! Your lies are so crafty it's too easy to mistake them for the truth. Even the Inquisitor is less skilled than you… ]]></string>
<string id="540459"><![CDATA[The inevitability. ]]></string>
<string id="540460"><![CDATA[Was I fighting you...?]]></string>
<string id="540461"><![CDATA[No, not really.]]></string>
<string id="540462"><![CDATA[Why? Look at your hands. Are they really yours? No, not these ones... Now count them. Are there exactly two and not four? ]]></string>
<string id="540463"><![CDATA[That's not funny. ]]></string>
<string id="540464"><![CDATA[Do not pretend to be alive. ]]></string>
<string id="540465"><![CDATA[I'm not pretending. But you shouldn't have called me a toy… I'll make you regret that… Tell me, who am I really? What do you think?]]></string>
<string id="540466"><![CDATA[A doll. ]]></string>
<string id="540467"><![CDATA[No. That is my doppelganger. My twin sister. ]]></string>
<string id="540468"><![CDATA[So I was mistaken. ]]></string>
<string id="540469"><![CDATA[Whatever I choose, you will immediately change your essence. Is that what you're hinting at?]]></string>
<string id="540470"><![CDATA[I'm in your head now! This is what I'm hinting at. I am you!]]></string>
<string id="540471"><![CDATA[Whatever! I'm in no mood to argue…]]></string>
<string id="540472"><![CDATA[Fine. Score one for you.]]></string>
<string id="540473"><![CDATA[...The Plague. ]]></string>
<string id="540474"><![CDATA[A miracle-maker.]]></string>
<string id="540478"><![CDATA[Let them shoot. I'm eagerly waiting for it all to go to hell!]]></string>
<string id="540479"><![CDATA[I hope this will not affect the course of war... ]]></string>
<string id="540480"><![CDATA[Are you afraid that too much blood will be spilled before the light of truth triumphs over the world? Don't. Yes, guns will destroy many before the war is ended. But when it ends, it will end forever. All earthly kingdoms will unite and exist in consent, and there will be but one Law! ]]></string>
<string id="540481"><![CDATA[Yes, this mission has become his first failure. He lost the army, failed to stop the plague and is now—with your help—going to break the order and rebel against the authority of a goverment Inquisitor. It may well be that he's bound to be sentenced to death. They're too afraid of him.]]></string>
<string id="540482"><![CDATA[You know... I will not give you the right to decide. Or was this exactly what you were going after?]]></string>
<string id="540483"><![CDATA[But you need him alive. Why?]]></string>
<string id="540484"><![CDATA[I shouldn't have brought you to the Cathedral, Changeling! Thankfully I was smart enough to talk to you before making a decision.]]></string>
<string id="540485"><![CDATA[You're laughing at me! In reality you already know he's doomed... ]]></string>
<string id="540486"><![CDATA[Just don't you think I don't feel sorry for him. He's noble, honest, and a true hero—an Alexander! Yes, he is destined to die… but we will save the town. Make your choice, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="540487"><![CDATA[I already have. You will have the right to speak.]]></string>
<string id="540488"><![CDATA[No, I won't give you the right to decide... You are the vilest creature of all creatures I've met recently.]]></string>
<string id="540489"><![CDATA[Both you and Burakh are semiliterate simpletons. So why are you both pitying me? Why won't you respect my knowledge as much as I respect yours?]]></string>
<string id="540490"><![CDATA[If it were so, I would not have taken you to the Cathedral, Changeling. ]]></string>
<string id="540491"><![CDATA[There Maria stands—she looks at you hopefully, her velvet eyes already ripe with scarlet fire. What is she waiting for then? What is she doing here at all? ]]></string>
<string id="540492"><![CDATA[She is waiting for my decision. ]]></string>
<string id="540493"><![CDATA[I don't know. I haven't talked to her yet. ]]></string>
<string id="540494"><![CDATA[Klara, you are plain stupid. You have understood nothing... ]]></string>
<string id="540495"><![CDATA[Yes. I have come. ]]></string>
<string id="540496"><![CDATA[I have already begun, my Daniil... When the night falls, and the wind scatters the smoke above the scorched earth, and the dust of the buildings demolished settles, you will see several new constellations light up in the sky. They will plunge their light towards us, and when the first specks of this light reach the castellations of the Polyhedron... a miracle will happen.]]></string>
<string id="540497"><![CDATA[Where will these constellations come from?]]></string>
<string id="540498"><![CDATA[After what happens today, the only thing light in the sky will be that of Mars…]]></string>
<string id="540499"><![CDATA[They have existed for a long time already. People just couldn't see them before because their light was hurrying towards us from far beyond. Now the first rays of these stars are about to reach our surfaces. We will see their light reflected in the specular planes of the preserved Polyhedron.]]></string>
<string id="540500"><![CDATA[What will they be like? How are you going to call them?]]></string>
<string id="540501"><![CDATA[I'll see. But I expect them to be mostly red. Ruby, scarlet, crimson, carmine, merlot, mahogany, vermillion, garnet, rose, pink, burgundy… Perhaps you may even notice something familiar in the structure of these constellations.]]></string>
<string id="540502"><![CDATA[What will become of your family, Maria? ]]></string>
<string id="540503"><![CDATA[Perishing, burning down, dissolving without a trace—this is my family's destiny. It happened to my mother; it happened to Simon. Tomorrow Georgiy dies, and my father will fade out in a week. And in ten years, when my town is complete, I will pass on in the same fashion.]]></string>
<string id="540504"><![CDATA[What will happen to the children? Will you expell them from the Tower?]]></string>
<string id="540505"><![CDATA[There's nothing to be done about it. They have to free up the space for the new guests. My brother will become embittered, betray me, and rebel against me. But I will find a way to deal with him. He will cower behind Capella's back willingly when my mother's eyes frown and glare at him!]]></string>
<string id="540506"><![CDATA[So you won't be living forever… Well, that is your destiny, Maria.]]></string>
<string id="540507"><![CDATA[Have you become a Mistress already?]]></string>
<string id="540508"><![CDATA[No, I haven't. You won't see it here—unless you're planning to stay, of course.]]></string>
<string id="540509"><![CDATA[I won't. I'll leave the town on the military train at dawn.]]></string>
<string id="540510"><![CDATA[I have considered the pros and the cons… I'm staying.]]></string>
<string id="540511"><![CDATA[Why are you here, Maria? ]]></string>
<string id="540512"><![CDATA[You ask strange questions. Don't you see that this is my town now? I am the power here. I am the mother, and since I am to give birth to a new town, I want to witness the demise of the old one. This is my duty. I am the last of the Kains.]]></string>
<string id="540513"><![CDATA[What about your brother? Aren't you going to share your power with him?]]></string>
<string id="540514"><![CDATA[No need to hurry, Maria. In fact, I haven't made up my mind yet. ]]></string>
<string id="540515"><![CDATA[…'Cause we've been to a funeral! They've been sending us out to the garden for ten days in a row so that we wouldn't get in anyone's way! They've been taking us to the cemetery for a week now, Bachelor. And if you keep being naughty, I'll take you with me next time and leave among the wreathes so that you know better!]]></string>
<string id="540516"><![CDATA[But why did you need dolls? Couldn't you have played without us?]]></string>
<string id="540517"><![CDATA[...So who died on you?]]></string>
<string id="540518"><![CDATA[No one did! No one ever does! Why is he asking about it…]]></string>
<string id="540519"><![CDATA[Hush, hush, no need to cry! Oh come on…]]></string>
<string id="540520"><![CDATA[See, doll? It was us, we've arranged all this. Turned out to be great! We've never made a world like this before. It's magical. We planted it and here's what has grown up. But now there's rot everywhere.]]></string>
<string id="540521"><![CDATA[You're calling me a doll, you whelp?]]></string>
<string id="540522"><![CDATA[Hey, don't call me names! Take it easy! Okay, it wasn't me who's made you, but I've had you since I was three. You're a doll—ask anyone! Your name is Haruspex. You are a ripper. You're always a bad guy when we're playing. Your face is all bruised and messed up!]]></string>
<string id="540523"><![CDATA[Yeah, that much is true… the headache is splitting. How about I mess your face up?]]></string>
<string id="540524"><![CDATA[Really? So you're not a doll? Go ahead, hit me then. Well, why are you just standing there? I dare you! Hit me with everything you have!]]></string>
<string id="540525"><![CDATA[You will regret this, I swear.]]></string>
<string id="540526"><![CDATA[What shall I do now?]]></string>
<string id="540527"><![CDATA[Stop moaning, get up and help us fix the town! You were doing well... Just a little bit left till the game is over. It's time for us to go home anyway.]]></string>
<string id="540528"><![CDATA[It's time for you to go to a youth detention center!]]></string>
<string id="540529"><![CDATA[I don't believe you. You are not real.]]></string>
<string id="540530"><![CDATA[I am a human being. It's you who is going to become a doll in my hands now, kiddo. ]]></string>
<string id="540531"><![CDATA[I am a human being.  ]]></string>
<string id="540532"><![CDATA[In that case you're a human being that closely resembles one of our toys. It's a Ripper, but we call it Burakh for fun.]]></string>
<string id="540533"><![CDATA[There's nothing funny about it, you little bloodsucker!]]></string>
<string id="540534"><![CDATA[It can't be! I am not your toy!]]></string>
<string id="540535"><![CDATA[I see. ]]></string>
<string id="540536"><![CDATA[If you are truly a saint, you shouldn't refuse a request as humane as mine.

Help me save the life of someone who is equally as persecuted as you are. I will be waiting at the Shelter.

<string id="540538"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="540539"><![CDATA[Have you forgotten something? We've just discussed all there was to discuss…]]></string>
<string id="540540"><![CDATA[I don't remember that! When was it? Just now, really?]]></string>
<string id="540541"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="540542"><![CDATA[Now is not a good time to talk, however important the matter.]]></string>
<string id="540543"><![CDATA[Nothing important. I'm just doing the rounds.]]></string>
<string id="540544"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="540545"><![CDATA[You're bothering me. I want to be alone.]]></string>
<string id="540546"><![CDATA[Bothering you? That's odd…]]></string>
<string id="540547"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="540548"><![CDATA[I have a terrible headache... but it will pass soon.]]></string>
<string id="540549"><![CDATA[Well, sorry to have bothered you… ]]></string>
<string id="540550"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="540551"><![CDATA[I'm waiting for someone. We need to talk privately... ]]></string>
<string id="540552"><![CDATA[I think I know who the visitor is...]]></string>
<string id="540553"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="540554"><![CDATA[Rest… All I need now is some rest.]]></string>
<string id="540555"><![CDATA[Just popping in to make sure you're alive and well.]]></string>
<string id="540556"><![CDATA[A friend of mine—his name is the Harpist—has gone to inspect a house for our shelter. He wanted to arrange for that house to be given to us. But he's been away a long time. If he's still there, tell him to come back here as soon as possible; I can't keep up without him.]]></string>
<string id="540557"><![CDATA[I'll bring your Harpist back safe and sound. Have no fear.]]></string>
<string id="540558"><![CDATA[Well enough... by a small town's standards.]]></string>
<string id="540559"><![CDATA[Tell me who she is then.]]></string>
<string id="540560"><![CDATA[Are you Olgimskys meaning to kill her?]]></string>
<string id="540561"><![CDATA[Ah, so that's why... Now I see clearly what's scaring her so much!]]></string>
<string id="540562"><![CDATA[That's the worst part. Had they done it for profit, their actions, however abominable, could have at least been explained. But their motives were a mystery. They'd take the best, and leave disfigured freaks in their place; and the children would become performers with their Caravan.]]></string>
<string id="540563"><![CDATA[Was Anna with the Caravan too?]]></string>
<string id="540564"><![CDATA[What did they need those children for?]]></string>
<string id="540565"><![CDATA[That's horrible... And what did they kidnap the children for?]]></string>
<string id="540566"><![CDATA[To replenish their troupe. They were collectors. Do you realize how the Kains must have hated them? The Caravan turned up at the exact time our children had settled at the Polyhedron, and the Kains saw that they had given the little ones of the town a magical childhood. The Caravan stood at the opposite pole, as it were: a challenge, a mockery, a reminder for Nina and Simon...]]></string>
<string id="540575"><![CDATA[But none the less powerful for it, aren't I?]]></string>
<string id="540576"><![CDATA[Oh, for how much longer are you all going to torture my father? No, he is not to blame for anything! Anything whatsoever! Remember it, in case anyone points the finger at him in the future! Why did I only give him my word...]]></string>
<string id="540577"><![CDATA[Someone's been sending anonymous threatening letters to Anna. She's convinced your father wants to punish her for something.]]></string>
<string id="540578"><![CDATA[He doesn't care about this Anna at all! But I suppose he's going to start now. Anonymous threats... way to slander him! Thank you for telling me. I'll strangle this Anna myself, the viper! With my own hands!]]></string>
<string id="540579"><![CDATA[But who could be sending her those letters? They're signed, "Look Back".]]></string>
<string id="540580"><![CDATA[What did you say? "Look Back"? I think I'm beginning to see now... Anna must have really been involved with the Caravan... which makes Khan the most likely writer of the letters. So that's why they all suddenly assembled at the Polyhedron five days ago and wouldn't leave. They had heard of the seeds of the Caravan sprouting in the town. Small wonder...]]></string>
<string id="540581"><![CDATA[I don't get it... Who assembled at the Polyhedron?]]></string>
<string id="540582"><![CDATA[Really though, what was the point of the whole plan? They probably had something else in mind too?]]></string>
<string id="540583"><![CDATA[No. Nothing. They travelled the country... acting, singing, performing stunts and tricks. They took bright children and left ugly ones on doorsteps as replacements. Like changelings... They were leaving fear, grief, hatred, and monsters in their wake—while themselves becoming ever more alluring, beautiful, attractive, and memorable. But despite that, people were growing more and more afraid of them.]]></string>
<string id="540584"><![CDATA[But that's a very clear picture of an imaginary evil... An evil that really only pretends to be evil.]]></string>
<string id="540585"><![CDATA[What is real evil then?]]></string>
<string id="540586"><![CDATA[Nothingness. The absence of feeling and colour. If a Caravan like that never existed, that would be the real evil.]]></string>
<string id="540587"><![CDATA[You'll soon get a practical demonstration. You'll see for yourself…]]></string>
<string id="540588"><![CDATA[That's horrible... There's so much hatred around! Was the Caravan destroyed?]]></string>
<string id="540589"><![CDATA[Yes. It attracted the attention of the Powers That Be fairly quickly. There was a real manhunt for them; they conducted raids and searches, they chased them... At first the Caravan miraculously managed to elude them, but eventually they were surrounded somewhere near Orv... A ballad was written about that attack. You've probably heard it.]]></string>
<string id="540590"><![CDATA[No, I don't remember hearing it…]]></string>
<string id="540591"><![CDATA[...But who could have defeated that evil if it had been real and not of the buffoonish kind? No one. And the Caravan would've made it as far as your Steppe by now.]]></string>
<string id="540592"><![CDATA[...And the Kains know about Anna's connection to the Caravan?]]></string>
<string id="540593"><![CDATA[Well, it hasn't been proved yet. But the day they find out will be the last day of her life, I have no doubt about it. The Caravan is a bogeyman that the Kains hate with a passion. A punishment by the government would be a walk in the park compared to the scourges that the Kains used to call down upon them.]]></string>
<string id="540594"><![CDATA[Could it be that the Kains have found out about Anna and are threatening her now?]]></string>
<string id="540595"><![CDATA[If it is so, then it can only be one particular Kain: the weakest and temporarily paralysed one. The others wouldn't stoop to threats; they'd act right away.]]></string>
<string id="540596"><![CDATA[Who is it then?]]></string>
<string id="540597"><![CDATA[Kaspar, also known as Khan. Victor and Nina's son, and black-eyed Maria's little brother. My sister will tell you all about him—they were friends for a while. At one point, our parents even considered arranging their marriage, despite the age difference... But they were too incompatible.]]></string>
<string id="540600"><![CDATA[Thanks for your advice. I'll talk to your sister.]]></string>
<string id="540601"><![CDATA[Well... thank you, Vladislav. Now let's see what your sister thinks about it.]]></string>
<string id="540602"><![CDATA[Yes... You do sound like you know what you're talking about... Who are you, Clara? Answer me!]]></string>
<string id="540603"><![CDATA[I've noticed that a lot of people here are scared of me. It's probably a trial I have to withstand…]]></string>
<string id="540604"><![CDATA[Why do I feel we have something in common, something important that's hard to miss... As if we were siblings... But what is it?]]></string>
<string id="540605"><![CDATA[Then tell me, what is your purpose in life?]]></string>
<string id="540606"><![CDATA[I already have a sister, and it's not you.]]></string>
<string id="540607"><![CDATA[I'd like to give the children a new life... and a new faith.]]></string>
<string id="540608"><![CDATA[Indeed? Then you must be the holy one? Then you too are a prophetess and a harbinger? And you're saying that you're going to gather a congregation and give them the light of a new truth? What truth will it be? Tell me, girl with eyes out of which a dead woman is looking at me already!]]></string>
<string id="540609"><![CDATA[I'm not saying I want to start a new church... I must have phrased it badly. You simply don't understand how good my intentions are…]]></string>
<string id="540610"><![CDATA[I know, sister... Don't be alarmed by the things I say. It's just that what you're talking about is too dangerous. It's not to be toyed with. Even if you're just children…]]></string>
<string id="540611"><![CDATA[You may be one of those to whom I've been sent as a harbinger.]]></string>
<string id="540612"><![CDATA[And why had the news of Caravan fugitives frightened the children so much?]]></string>
<string id="540613"><![CDATA[What is the Caravan? ]]></string>
<string id="540614"><![CDATA[It's that circus of wandering murderers. The one where singers were abducting children... and doing horrible things to them. It was an enormous circus troupe doubling as a cult of some sort. A mysterious story that's still unclear on many points. The reprisal was too hasty, and the investigation too muddled. They had frightened everyone too much.]]></string>
<string id="540615"><![CDATA[Frightened how?]]></string>
<string id="540617"><![CDATA[Basically, they used to abduct children. It is said they brought them up as actors, in order to attract new audiences... They picked the best. But now, so many years later, there have been so many legends, so many ballads and scary stories about them that no-one remembers the truth anymore. In the children's ears, the word "Caravan" is simply synonymous with a maddening and inescapable horror.]]></string>
<string id="540618"><![CDATA[But it's only Anna, and she's alone…]]></string>
<string id="540619"><![CDATA[Khan will give her no peace regardless. In his mind, even a single living Caravan actor is a being who will sow and spread the seeds of this senseless monstrosity... like an infection of sorts.]]></string>
<string id="540620"><![CDATA[By the way, Anna has an accomplice: the hunchback usurer!]]></string>
<string id="540621"><![CDATA[Stakh, I'm not an informer... How could you think something like that of me? I myself, who's yet to do anything except good and kindly things to people, am being hunted and scrutinized inside out—like some epitome of evil!]]></string>
<string id="540625"><![CDATA[I don't need your vaccines, Rubin. I sense something scary in them... Besides, I don't think there'll be enough for everybody...]]></string>
<string id="540626"><![CDATA[You just try to inform on me! I'll tear you to shreds! I'll grab you by your ankles with my one hand and by your wrists with the other and... Got just enough arm span for that!]]></string>

<string id="540634"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="540635"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="540637"><![CDATA[I know everything, Stakh Rubin. Tell me where Simon is. At first I even thought you might be him... You mountain of a man... You impossible man!]]></string>
<string id="540638"><![CDATA[That's true. But Simon's body has been stolen. Do you understand? He's not where I examined him anymore.]]></string>
<string id="540639"><![CDATA[Anna Angel did. She advised me to tip the Kains off about you and the Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="540640"><![CDATA[Anna Angel is a crazy neurotic, with nothing inside and nothing of her own on the outside: a salad of haphazard imitations and borrowing. This rumour-mongering of hers is a typical example. Any more questions?]]></string>
<string id="540641"><![CDATA[Look, I do believe you. But suppose Anna tells somebody else? She told me to go and check—when she could've just as easily written a letter to the Kains…]]></string>
<string id="540642"><![CDATA[What kind of vials?]]></string>
<string id="540643"><![CDATA[A... special kind. Vaccines. I'm going to make a few hundred and give them to Isidor's apprentices to distribute to the people so that no-one gets ill. If the Termitary is re-opened, they'll deliver them to the Kin. If it isn't, they'll give it to the people. To everyone. So that there's enough for all.]]></string>
<string id="540644"><![CDATA[True... except for the false part.  Is that how you always lie, Roubin? Don't do it, you're rather bad at it. Childishly bad…]]></string>
<string id="540645"><![CDATA[Don't hide from me. I mean no harm to anybody. There's no act that I couldn't understand, explain, and forgive…]]></string>
<string id="540646"><![CDATA[All right... I'll tell you. Yes, it was I who stole the body. The Bachelor knows nothing. And the reason I stole it, Clara, was that I wished to carry through with my duty. I'm a doctor, I've sworn the oath... and not only the same oath everyone swears, but also a special one... to my Master.]]></string>
<string id="540647"><![CDATA[So why did you steal Simon's body?]]></string>
<string id="540648"><![CDATA[My Master was a Menkhu... who had renounced his lawful power entirely for the sake of the Kin's prosperity... He dedicated all his efforts to medicine, instead of the art of bull-drawing or the science of government. He probably knew or sensed something. And so, were it not for his vile murder, he would now be doing everything in order for the Kin to live on.]]></string>
<string id="540649"><![CDATA[And it's probably more important than that other one, right?]]></string>
<string id="540650"><![CDATA[And that's why you stole Simon?]]></string>
<string id="540651"><![CDATA[Simon was more than a mere human. He had transfigured his entire essence in such a way that every particle of his being would align with the law of universal harmony. Simon had fashioned himself after Bos Turokh—so they said at the Kin, meaning that for them, he had become divine.]]></string>
<string id="540652"><![CDATA[Who is Bos Turokh?]]></string>
<string id="540653"><![CDATA[The World Bull. He out of whom the Universe was made. Everything that happens to this being, all of its vital processes, all of its shapes, are signs and semblances reflecting all that was, is, or will be in this world. All creatures carry that knowledge within—but the Universal Bull and its semblances embody it fully!]]></string>
<string id="540654"><![CDATA[This is heresy, Rubin. This is so not how the Universe was created!]]></string>
<string id="540655"><![CDATA[I'm beginning to understand you now... So two days were not enough to complete your study of this... Bos Turokh transfiguree?]]></string>
<string id="540656"><![CDATA[Not nearly enough. He really is different from other people. And I've seen a lot of those. Many different creatures have revealed their nature under my scalpel. So what are you intending to do?]]></string>
<string id="540657"><![CDATA[I've found out everything I wanted to know. I'm leaving.]]></string>
<string id="540658"><![CDATA[You know that already. Why ask?]]></string>
<string id="540659"><![CDATA[Yes. You've understood what I'm talking about. Goodbye, Rubin. Prepare yourself for a formidable test.]]></string>
<string id="540660"><![CDATA[I'm a Kshatriya, not a Brahmin.]]></string>
<string id="540661"><![CDATA[I feel there's still a lot we need to talk about... You are blasphemously doing what can only be performed by one invested with a special right to power.]]></string>
<string id="540662"><![CDATA[This is what the people of the Steppe believe. And I'm telling you that Simon... is more than a man. I'll go on working on him for a long time yet. And Victor and Georgiy aren't going to stop me!]]></string>
<string id="540663"><![CDATA[Aren't you a little too sure of that? Do you have a lot of places left to hide? I wonder how they haven't found you yet…]]></string>
<string id="540664"><![CDATA[You are wicked, Burakh... And scary. You know, you and the Bachelor really are... inhuman. What with all this spite emanating from you... And I feel that there's an enormous and evil creature controlling you both with its hands!]]></string>
<string id="540665"><![CDATA[I've just been thinking about the feeling you give me—and there you go! No better way to describe it. Some call you a saint—but to me, you look like the exact opposite. It's said that all tempters assume the guise of holiness!]]></string>
<string id="540666"><![CDATA[Well... I've come to tell you that you must leave. There's a manhunt underway for the Ripper. It's led by the Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="540667"><![CDATA[Stay where you are, demon! I don't know if I'll be able to kill you today—but you will lose a lot of blood. You are mortal too, I know it... however hard to kill you may prove!]]></string>
<string id="540668"><![CDATA[Wasn't it you who stole Simon's body? You certainly didn't do it in order to bury him. You're holding a freshly sharpened scalpel!]]></string>
<string id="540669"><![CDATA[...I never touched Simon—in fact, I never even met him. But if you tell the Bachelor that I've stolen his body and that I'm here, I'll be in a lot of trouble. A patrol will be dispatched here at once, and my mission will end in failure.]]></string>
<string id="540670"><![CDATA[Stop... You have no idea...]]></string>
<string id="540671"><![CDATA[Every time you show up at The Crucible, be prepared to suffer! These walls will burn the very thing within you that allows you to do your wicked work. Call it magic, if you will, or call it supreme justice.]]></string>
<string id="540672"><![CDATA[…And how are you going to drive me out, old man? Will you draw a circle around yourself, or cover the walls with arcane signs? Aren't you afraid that will summon a demon scarier still?]]></string>
<string id="540673"><![CDATA[I just wanted to...]]></string>
<string id="540674"><![CDATA[All the suffering you will have gone through here will seem like gentle caresses compared to the torture you will endure if Maria touches you—not even with her gaze, but with thought alone, a mere recollection of you! Be warned, heiress of the earth! Now begone!]]></string>
<string id="540675"><![CDATA[Ouch! It burns! What is this? What is this?]]></string>
<string id="540676"><![CDATA[Ouch! You'll regret this, impudent old man! Your sorcery won't save any of you from retribution!]]></string>
<string id="540677"><![CDATA[I am a harbinger.]]></string>
<string id="540678"><![CDATA[It won't help.]]></string>
<string id="540679"><![CDATA[You don't have to worry about that. Rest assured you will do something for me. In fact, you are doing something for me already, even if inadvertently. Believe it or not, but the pleasure brought by your visit feels startlingly physical for the kind of purely intellectual stimulus it actually is.]]></string>
<string id="540680"><![CDATA[...Is this something that you expected?]]></string>
<string id="540681"><![CDATA[Shame on you, Yulia! You're making me blush...]]></string>
<string id="540682"><![CDATA["Expected!" An apt observation indeed! Bear with me, please; I am still young, and whatever acumen I've had the time to acquire is clearly not enough to suppress the excitement one feels when everything happens just the way it was expected to happen. Oh, the joy I feel when everything falls well in line with what I have predicted—by which I don't mean the brute probabilism your mother would resort to, but a watertight, well-grounded calculation of likelihood! You check your notes... you make minuscule adjustments... and then—bang! You see your assumptions gain flesh at your own doorstep.]]></string>
<string id="540683"><![CDATA[I'm happy that you've been expecting me. However silly it might be to be happy about it.]]></string>
<string id="540684"><![CDATA[I suppose you worked out on paper what I should look like too, didn't you?]]></string>
<string id="540685"><![CDATA[Frankly, I imagined you as a completely different person. Tall as a lamp post; white; ragged... with your ribs bare, and a firm, shapely bosom. Long hair, off-white and disheveled of course... and a pair of huge, puffy peepers.]]></string>
<string id="540686"><![CDATA[That's the image of a saint. It's what they would look like a thousand years ago…]]></string>
<string id="540687"><![CDATA[Nice. Was I by any chance carrying a long, rapaciously curved scythe?]]></string>
<string id="540688"><![CDATA[Right. Enough silliness. Let us get to the meat of the matter. You know... I am dying to know what your request may be. I'd even venture an educated guess that you wanted to ask me something about Eva Yan? But what could it be? Anyone could have told you the basic facts; who she is, where she lives, what she prefers to wear... Are you interested in something else then; something concerning her soul? Is this the case?]]></string>
<string id="540689"><![CDATA[But how would you... Who told you? Did you speak with Katerina? Is this some kind of a joke?]]></string>
<string id="540690"><![CDATA[Alas, no, Yulia. I wanted nothing of the sort. You can roll cigarettes from your scribbled calculations. I don't fit into your constructs!]]></string>
<string id="540691"><![CDATA[Oh no, I didn't speak with Katerina; I never do. Morphine addicts and other kinds of substance abusers are not the company I normally prefer. They make too bleak an impression. I have ceased my relationship with the Stamatin twins for that very reason. Now these two are of potential interest to you. Did you meet them yet?]]></string>
<string id="540692"><![CDATA[How did you know I was going to ask you about Eva?]]></string>
<string id="540693"><![CDATA[Tell me more about the Cathedral! Why is it so empty?]]></string>
<string id="540694"><![CDATA[Why... it is empty because it was built before the religion was allowed to reach maturity. Even an atheist like me knows what a cathedral is for. They are not—as Peter Stamatin would have it—"a set of walls covered by a roof". Rather than that, they're vessels of the numinous; miracle incubators, if you will. The issue, in our particular case, is that we have the Tower on the other side of the river to serve this very purpose...]]></string>

<string id="540697"><![CDATA[Why are you looking at me like that?]]></string>
<string id="540698"><![CDATA[I am going to keep looking at you, or rather to keep watching you. I get the feeling that every move you make may be reliably predicted. This is not an opportunity I would ever miss, for it feeds remarkably well into one of my theories... perhaps, the most pessimistic of them all. Well, off you go... harbinger.]]></string>

<string id="540700"><![CDATA[I'm brave! I'm not afraid of you!]]></string>

<string id="540703"><![CDATA[You're mistaking me for someone else... As I have come, so I will go... And right now I only want peace…]]></string>
<string id="540704"><![CDATA[Destroying you, a Mistress of the Earth in the making, would take too much of my power... After you collapse with a ruptured heart, I will be lethargic for over a year. And right now I need that power like never before.]]></string>

<string id="540706"><![CDATA[Why? To charm the Bachelor?]]></string>
<string id="540707"><![CDATA[...Lethargic? Did you say lethargic?]]></string>
<string id="540708"><![CDATA[You ought to know that in a matter of a few days my power will grow to its fullness, and I will reclaim all of the scintillae of magic now scattered across the Memory of my dear mother. Run away from here. As soon as I become a Mistress, this plague will be over—no matter who sent it upon us. There will be no place for you here.]]></string>

<string id="540713"><![CDATA[See, Mark? Shall we give her a chance perhaps? It'll be a lot of fun. So what was it you were hoping to tell Mark? Could it be the same thing you told my uncle Georgiy the other day? Actually, I'm beginning to get angry... I should be angry now but this is just too amusing...]]></string>
<string id="540714"><![CDATA[There will be nothing amusing about that, Maria Kaina. Oh, how I hate you! Goodbye! ]]></string>
<string id="540715"><![CDATA[So I've been saved by my sheer lack of artifice?]]></string>
<string id="540716"><![CDATA[Of course, Clara. Surely you didn't think those tricks would work on us. Or is there really something you're missing? Could I be the naïve one, and you the saint?

<string id="540720"><![CDATA[Capella has had a bad dream about a tragedy striking at the Cathedral. Very soon, perhaps as we speak. Have you had the same dream?]]></string>
<string id="540723"><![CDATA[It also concerns the demon you worship so much—I mean the Bachelor. After all, it was he who occupied and defiled the town's Cathedral!]]></string>
<string id="540724"><![CDATA[How exactly did he defile it? Perhaps by sheltering sufferers in it? Why, it's only because of him that the Cathedral has at least partly begun to serve its divine purpose! Its routine has changed—but only to bring it back to the intended roots; how can a Changeling like you not feel it? What fool has called you a saint?]]></string>
<string id="540725"><![CDATA[Pull yourself together. Capella has had a dream in which tragedy struck at the Cathedral. Everyone inside was dead! It's worth checking!]]></string>
<string id="540726"><![CDATA[You'll remember my words tomorrow! I had a dream once…]]></string>
<string id="540727"><![CDATA[You could not possibly have had any dreams. Don't lie to me. If you actually had that nonexistent sister, she could be the one having prophetic dreams. Not you.]]></string>
<string id="540728"><![CDATA[You don't even have to... you probably know everything anyway, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="540729"><![CDATA[All right... Capella has had a dream in which the infection found its way into the Cathedral and killed everyone inside!]]></string>
<string id="540730"><![CDATA[Alive, you say? It would've been a good idea to listen when the bells were ringing…]]></string>
<string id="540731"><![CDATA[Yikes! No! I'm afraid! Suppose I walk in and there are dead people in there. And I'll get blamed afterwards…]]></string>
<string id="540734"><![CDATA[Don't be afraid. The Cathedral is well-guarded. Here, take some money and give it to the guards. They'll open the doors and you will check together... You will have witnesses...]]></string>
<string id="540735"><![CDATA[That could work... Either way, I won't go past the door.]]></string>
<string id="540736"><![CDATA[Give me your hands, let me touch you... And you, and you, and you too... There, there, no need to be afraid... Nothing more will happen...]]></string>

<string id="540738"><![CDATA[Must be some dirt in my eye, I'm sorry... Or maybe a piece of clay... I need to rub my eyes... Where are you?]]></string>
<string id="540739"><![CDATA[You don't see me, watchful guard. And my voice is your own fancy. It's coming from within...]]></string>
<string id="540740"><![CDATA[Who knows?]]></string>
<string id="540741"><![CDATA[There'd be none to see in any case... They say it strikes at once. One faints before one can take three steps. Only someone special—someone like Burakh, Simon, or a Bound person—can withstand the sickness for a long time... ]]></string>

<string id="540743"><![CDATA[I have…]]></string>
<string id="540744"><![CDATA[Did she abuse you? Or was she kind? You didn't mention my name, did you?]]></string>
<string id="540745"><![CDATA[She almost killed me! Every time I'm at the Crucible, the Kains use some kind of destructive magnetism against me!]]></string>
<string id="540746"><![CDATA[I'm so sorry... Can I do anything to reward you for what you've had to suffer through?]]></string>
<string id="540747"><![CDATA[I'd prefer never to see her again…]]></string>
<string id="540748"><![CDATA[No. I should even say it was an enlightening visit. And I'm most content with how it turned out.]]></string>
<string id="540749"><![CDATA[Drop a word for me... At least to your friends, the children.]]></string>
<string id="540750"><![CDATA[I can guess. Are you and I really Mistresses, though? Can you really say something like that to me? Why joke like that?]]></string>
<string id="540751"><![CDATA[I had a dreadful dream last night. I saw a sinister creature come in the dark of night—a thing of the Steppe, a shabnak-adyr. She sneaked into the Cathedral and killed everyone, everyone who was hiding in there! All around, I saw the dead—the dead—the dead!]]></string>
<string id="540752"><![CDATA[How can I help you?]]></string>
<string id="540753"><![CDATA[I do not know if I should trust that dream... Maybe it was no vision—I'm not used to having those yet, and cannot tell a dream from a Dream... And the children wouldn't stop talking about the shabnak-adyr to me. They've been told all those scary things...]]></string>
<string id="540754"><![CDATA[No, Capella dear. I don't know that yet.]]></string>
<string id="540755"><![CDATA[Well… it makes sense. Can't an infected person get inside? ]]></string>
<string id="540756"><![CDATA[The probability is very small. But the Bachelor is the one who estimates the time since infection, for his own bigoted reasons. He has some diabolical term for it, "the latent stage"... Something he needs to put in his reports to the capital…]]></string>
<string id="540757"><![CDATA[Should we really be afraid of your dream then?]]></string>
<string id="540758"><![CDATA[I'd rather ask Katerina.]]></string>
<string id="540759"><![CDATA[Forgive me, Clara dear, I know she is your mother now—but Katerina is wrong too often. You can ask her if you wish, but I know that her visions are often distorted. The theme is right but the details are twisted. And the demon is in the details this time.]]></string>
<string id="540760"><![CDATA[I feel sick every time I'm at the Crucible... Maria is going to kill me.]]></string>
<string id="540761"><![CDATA[If the dream is prophetic, it will destroy her Bachelor. An envoy from the capital is arriving the day after tomorrow, and everything will depend on them. Maria will never go as far as to put her Bachelor's success at risk. And I'll reward you!]]></string>
<string id="540762"><![CDATA[But why don't you want to write her a letter?]]></string>
<string id="540763"><![CDATA[Why are you calling the two of you Mistresses anyway? I don't know about Maria, but you—how are you a Mistress? ]]></string>
<string id="540764"><![CDATA[I'm still only a girl. But that will change... Try it regardless! The Kains don't think that bad of you. They always try to be intimidating, they like to dramatize everything, they enjoy striking up a pose! My dear... I'll reward you just for asking the question! If only you ask it on your own behalf! Please!]]></string>

<string id="540766"><![CDATA[Simon is not dead.]]></string>

<string id="540769"><![CDATA[Maria told me you had them…]]></string>
<string id="540770"><![CDATA[What, you and Maria talk to each other? Unbelievable. Maria denounced you as a Changeling and said that if you came to her again, she'd have you thrown into the Gorkhon to see if you'd sink or swim. Does this mean you've swum?]]></string>
<string id="540771"><![CDATA[No!]]></string>
<string id="540772"><![CDATA[I'd like to see if everything's all right in there. I have a suspicion that something bad might happen inside.]]></string>

<string id="540774"><![CDATA[I'll only have a quick look…]]></string>
<string id="540775"><![CDATA[You monster! You're keeping them there in such conditions? It's like a death camp!]]></string>

<string id="540777"><![CDATA[So you sank? That makes you a non-witch; but then you must be a revenant, and I don't know which is worse. Shame that the bullets in my revolver are leaden and not silver. But perhaps they'll do too…]]></string>

<string id="540781"><![CDATA[Do you remember everything I have told you about those Bound of yours who are infected with a utopian heresy—and about some of them... or perhaps many of them being instrumental in bringing the wrath of heaven upon our town?]]></string>

<string id="540783"><![CDATA[There is a mansion in the Stone Yard called The Stillwater. Living there is a girl named Eva Yan. Both good and bad things are said about her; she is said to be affectionate and depraved, a kind soul while also voluptuous... but I am not talking about that. Lust is not the kind of sin to incur such a punishment.]]></string>
<string id="540784"><![CDATA[Why are you talking about her then?]]></string>
<string id="540785"><![CDATA[Eva has been led astray by utopian ideas. What has particularly captured my attention is that Eva, the gentle Eva Yan, is spending an extraordinary amount of time at—the town's Cathedral. There is no knowing as to what is drawing her there... but her way of life is incongruous with such a piety. It is mysterious...]]></string>
<string id="540786"><![CDATA[I'll try to solve it, mother.]]></string>
<string id="540787"><![CDATA[Eve is gentle and weak... Begin with her. She is unlikely to be rude with you.

As if dimwitted blackguards murdering women in the streets wasn't enough—it seems that our governor is now inclined to extend his greedy reach towards the town's notable people. Several young women stand accused after the Cathedral business.]]></string>
<string id="540876"><![CDATA[More importantly, they say that you are now able to track down the shapeshifting disease carrier, сomparing their blood to that sample you obtained yesterday. If they are one of the townsfolk, it can't be that hard to recognize them. ]]></string>

<string id="540881"><![CDATA[Is there anything I can do?]]></string>
<string id="540882"><![CDATA[Check on them—now that you have the capability. Hurry, before your discovery breeds baseless speculations. One would want to save innocent lives. Or else… nothing can be certain in a situation like this.]]></string>

<string id="540886"><![CDATA[...Do you believe that too?]]></string>
<string id="540887"><![CDATA[Think about Peter... Throwing that weight off our enemies' side of the scale will give us more breathing room. Perhaps the plague will stop…]]></string>
<string id="540888"><![CDATA[How can I gain his trust?]]></string>
<string id="540889"><![CDATA[Hmm... It all hinges on Maria again... Maria and Nina... yes, that is too strong a citadel... only a miracle could help you.]]></string>
<string id="540890"><![CDATA[Is Peter in love with Maria?]]></string>
<string id="540891"><![CDATA[…What?]]></string>
<string id="540892"><![CDATA[And then I'll drink with you. So what do you think? Will you answer? ]]></string>
<string id="540893"><![CDATA[How did you manage to do that, Peter?]]></string>
<string id="540894"><![CDATA[Wait! …Why are you asking me? I can see you taking me by the hand, leading me here... a circle of light from a bright lamp.. Stop! I sought oblivion in the green fairy's embrace... I desired you, so that you could give me a chance to forget... and you're reminding me again? You're lying! Who are you?]]></string>
<string id="540895"><![CDATA[What's wrong with you? Haven't you seen me before?]]></string>
<string id="540896"><![CDATA[You're all but dead, Peter! Do you understand what this daydream of yours means?]]></string>
<string id="540897"><![CDATA[I don't know... I'll do what Andrey says... Bring my brother to me... Where are you, brother? You're the only one I trust... I'm surrounded by ghosts, by translucent greenness... maras and chimeras... the double-faced Changeling... only he is real, my support, my bulwark...]]></string>

<string id="540900"><![CDATA[I'm Clara. The harbinger. I've come for you!]]></string>
<string id="540901"><![CDATA[Why am I double-faced?]]></string>
<string id="540902"><![CDATA[Look, there are two of you... oh, chimeras, chimeras, monsters... One's hanging from the lamp hook on the ceiling, lighting up the place; your green lips smiling, whispering something... The other one—there she is, laughing at me, crouching in the far corner... dissolving into pond weed...]]></string>
<string id="540903"><![CDATA[Wait! I'll bring you back to life…]]></string>
<string id="540904"><![CDATA[Had you been alive, Peter, you'd have converted. But you're dead already.]]></string>

<string id="540906"><![CDATA[Look, my sister and I are twins too. But one of us is here, on this inner side of Existence, and the other's on its outer side. We are one, but I'll never take her by the hand. Convert, Peter.]]></string>
<string id="540907"><![CDATA[Why? Death... I'm terrified of death. Of true death... this here is just a game for now. It's not real yet, is it?]]></string>
<string id="540908"><![CDATA[There's nothing terrifying about death... Not for you at this point, anyway... The void of oblivion is what's terrible... Convert.]]></string>
<string id="540909"><![CDATA[You speak too simply and too fast... But you scare me nonetheless... No, I'd prefer a painful death... The vivid death of a martyr burned at the stake... I couldn't bear oblivion... I won't accept it.]]></string>
<string id="540910"><![CDATA[Convert. Here, I'm turning around and leaving. I'm the angel of your death. Make your choice while you still have time. You've summoned me, and here I am—here to comfort you.]]></string>
<string id="540911"><![CDATA[I've come for you. But you won't heed me... Farewell.]]></string>

<string id="540915"><![CDATA[Yes, it isn't. But that's just for now. Reconsider, Peter. Come back.]]></string>
<string id="540916"><![CDATA[Come back to me.]]></string>
<string id="540917"><![CDATA[What? What do you mean, in danger? Now you've truly grabbed my attention! What's happened to him? Let's go, you'll tell me all about it along the way…]]></string>
<string id="540918"><![CDATA[Your brother holds heretic views…]]></string>
<string id="540919"><![CDATA[Andrey, oh Andrey, I know of you this: you're in love with Maria...]]></string>
<string id="540920"><![CDATA[Nonsense! I'm not in love with Maria. I do admire her—that goes without saying—but I only love one person in the world, and that's my brother. So cut the crud and tell me what's threatening him!]]></string>
<string id="540921"><![CDATA[Andrey, I fear that this pestilence has been sent down upon him—personally.]]></string>
<string id="540922"><![CDATA[Forget it, Andrey! Let's pretend we never had this conversation, all right?]]></string>
<string id="540923"><![CDATA[A miracle, you say? …No, I wouldn't throw that man out. Goodbye, Andrey. Forgive me for being so faint-hearted.]]></string>
<string id="540924"><![CDATA[But…]]></string>
<string id="540925"><![CDATA[So you're saying we have incurred wrath from above with our impudence? Liar! Double, triple liar! I don't know what God you believe in, but I don't think you're even old enough to have a concept of one! And you are either a lying impostor—or an abominable Changeling, a temptress, a thing from hell, a shabnak-adyr, a maneater, made of dead bones and dirty clay!]]></string>
<string id="540926"><![CDATA[Don't yell at me, don't call me... that! I'm leaving... I'm leaving!]]></string>
<string id="540927"><![CDATA[Oh but yes, precisely!]]></string>
<string id="540928"><![CDATA[And here's what I'll tell you: only a godless apostate and devil-worshipper, which is what you Saburovs are, could dare deny the greatness of God's design! It is nothing like that tower built out of an ambition to topple heaven. It's a different world, you idiot! This tower was not built for the sake of faith or of faithlessness. It's something else entirely!]]></string>
<string id="540929"><![CDATA[What's the tower got to do with it?]]></string>
<string id="540930"><![CDATA[I will not betray my brother's creation, and I will not let you tarnish his name! Get lost! Go to hell. Go back to the earth you came from!]]></string>
<string id="540931"><![CDATA[No, I don't dare do anything of the sort... Who am I to talk like that... Goodbye, Andrey!]]></string>
<string id="540932"><![CDATA[There is only one world. You've been living without faith before—so I'm here to give you a jolt!]]></string>
<string id="540933"><![CDATA[All right. I'll think about it... Perhaps I even won't go back to him at all.]]></string>
<string id="540934"><![CDATA[It’s written all over your face. But let’s get right down to business, seeing as you have very little time; the walls of this house are pernicious to you, little imp. What is it, then, that’s causing your displeasure with me or, say, with the most charming Mistress of... this hospitable house?]]></string>
<string id="540935"><![CDATA[Mark Immortell, I accuse you of heresy and blasphemy. You were the one that brought down the plague upon the town!]]></string>
<string id="540936"><![CDATA[Now those are some strong words! You're much too impressionable, my child. Katerina's only dabbling in prophetic rhetoric because it's her last resort, now that she's foreseen the beginning of the end... An ugly trick to pull, and cheap too... take a professional's word for it.]]></string>
<string id="540937"><![CDATA[What, are you a priest?]]></string>
<string id="540938"><![CDATA[What? What did you call me?]]></string>
<string id="540939"><![CDATA[That was affectionate. I could take my words back though. Admittedly you don't quite fit the definition yet... but you're almost there... although there's still some hope left. Perhaps a miracle will happen and you'll turn away from that path.]]></string>
<string id="540940"><![CDATA[You've challenged heaven. You're the reason for all that's happening now…]]></string>
<string id="540941"><![CDATA[Why all the twisted notions? Why are you so hateful? It's only play-acting, all of it! Like any game, play-acting is a mere shadow of Existence, a tiny fragment of it, a semblance—not a hollow semblance, mind you, quite the contrary, filled to the brim! Play-acting is fuller than reality... since it's smaller.]]></string>
<string id="540942"><![CDATA[You're always play-acting! Always a mummer! That's why you have this manner of explaining things.]]></string>
<string id="540943"><![CDATA[Yours is a world without faith…]]></string>
<string id="540944"><![CDATA[There's room for God inside the tiniest fragment…]]></string>
<string id="540945"><![CDATA[And who told you He's not present in here, Changeling?]]></string>
<string id="540946"><![CDATA[All I've seen here so far is the dead hollowness of puppetry!]]></string>
<string id="540947"><![CDATA[That explains a lot, doesn't it?]]></string>
<string id="540948"><![CDATA[It does to you, puppet master!]]></string>
<string id="540949"><![CDATA[Another toy semblance…]]></string>
<string id="540950"><![CDATA[It will lie to me too... How am I supposed to convince myself?]]></string>
<string id="540951"><![CDATA[And who are you?]]></string>
<string id="540952"><![CDATA[I've been posted here on the Bachelor's orders! I am an Executor, and I oversee the hospital. You are not allowed to go inside. Do you hear those horrendous screams? It's the agony of the incurable.]]></string>
<string id="540953"><![CDATA[Where is the owner of the Theatre? Is he dead?]]></string>
<string id="540954"><![CDATA[Oh no... Tell me I don't have to go there again! Why is he so careless about choosing his friends?]]></string>
<string id="540955"><![CDATA[I see your mendacity with my own eyes now.]]></string>
<string id="540956"><![CDATA[That's not true!]]></string>
<string id="540957"><![CDATA[I'm leaving—gotta lay low for a while. See you underground. And I'll always be glad to see you—you of all people should know I'm not at all as mendacious as my jealous detractors are making me look! You'll always be my welcome guest…]]></string>
<string id="540958"><![CDATA[It would seem that you're right... And what is your nature, prophet?]]></string>
<string id="540959"><![CDATA[All this time, none other but you have been the disease personified—the tool for the world to restore the balance with. All this time, there have been no sister. All this time, Clara has been chasing herself around, confounded by Katerina's visions becoming true.]]></string>
<string id="540960"><![CDATA[I don't believe you... Prove that you're telling the truth!]]></string>
<string id="540961"><![CDATA[Oh, just rejoice, will you? Your actions have attracted the attention of the almighty Powers That Be. Do you know what they want from you? They'll send you a note today. Forget your silly little tricks; now your only chance to prove you are not the plague is to perform a genuine miracle.]]></string>
<string id="540962"><![CDATA[You're lying. I've already performed many miracles.]]></string>
<string id="540963"><![CDATA[Do you really trust me so much?]]></string>
<string id="540964"><![CDATA[And killed just as many people with your miraculous hands. No one knows what you are. No, you need a miracle on a grand scale. Something all-encompassing. Something to shape the world. Make it happen—and boom!—we'll believe you. And I'm not talking about those gnarly... angulous... freaks. Their pseudo-lives are of absolutely no importance.]]></string>
<string id="540965"><![CDATA[It's all just a game for you! How dare you!]]></string>
<string id="540966"><![CDATA[In the end, you'll be surprised to find out that everything that you've heard, every single thing, was the honest truth—even the seemingly contradictory things.]]></string>
<string id="540967"><![CDATA[So the Powers That Be will tell me what to do?]]></string>
<string id="540968"><![CDATA[Think twice before doing as they tell you, though. Those guys are a bunch of little liars.]]></string>

<string id="540970"><![CDATA[It's all just a game for you! How dare you!]]></string>
<string id="540972"><![CDATA[Yulia! People love me... I've done them so much good... I've even been called a saint...]]></string>
<string id="540973"><![CDATA[You? A saint? What kind of an imbecile would call you that? Is there even a God that you believe in? You are a changeling, and your sainthood is the lamest kind of mimetic apery. You remind me of Anna Angel at times. She is utterly ludicrous, I grant you, a grimacing imp, if you will. You are a bit more serious than that.]]></string>
<string id="540974"><![CDATA[What are you saying? What are you even talking about?]]></string>
<string id="540975"><![CDATA[I'm sure you have. I feel sorry for you, Aglaya Lilich…]]></string>

<string id="540993"><![CDATA[Who was Clara, the grave-born? The one who raised her hands first?]]></string>
<string id="541006"><![CDATA[And yet I still have to choose a reply from the options I'm offered.]]></string>
<string id="541007"><![CDATA[The real game is what's happening between you and us. That was an official warning I had to make. I warned the previous charcaters too, but they went straight for questions... Such boring people.]]></string>
<string id="541034"><![CDATA[I don't think I'll be able to ask a more interesting question…]]></string>
<string id="541036"><![CDATA[I know, he's a demon...  I can sense his otherworldly nature! Is there really no escaping him?]]></string>
<string id="541037"><![CDATA[My sister... Aren't you her? Aren't you the sister I spoke into existence?]]></string>
<string id="541038"><![CDATA[No... But I'll console you.. Your sister is here... she has talked to me a lot.. her and I are alike too, we are one... because she is you... don't be quick to condemn her... she too is dismayed, not knowing who she is... one of you will make her choice, and the other will follow.]]></string>
<string id="541039"><![CDATA[It's all so complicated! I can't understand your allegories! But tell me, I'm the miracle-worker, aren't I—and not her?]]></string>
<string id="541040"><![CDATA[Who is my sister then? Am I not the Mistress of the Earth?]]></string>
<string id="541042"><![CDATA[No, no... Somehow I feel it's not what's going to happen to me! I don't want to get my own back on the Powers! I can sense how weak they are... I'm sorry for them.]]></string>
<string id="541043"><![CDATA[Shut up and listen to me. Did they want miracles from you?]]></string>
<string id="541044"><![CDATA[Yes... Three days ago I received a letter…]]></string>
<string id="541046"><![CDATA[I don't think so!]]></string>
<string id="541047"><![CDATA[I don't know who I am either... It seems I'm a soul that's been put on trial before you... shortly before its impending death.]]></string>
<string id="541048"><![CDATA[I didn't give myself that prerogative! Or are you already putting me on trial as a thief, to be hanged alongside robbers and looters?]]></string>
<string id="541049"><![CDATA[Alone? I'm not sure of that…]]></string>
<string id="541050"><![CDATA[I'll visit them to look into their eyes again. But I'll come back with my own verdict, same as back then! And you'll defer to it! That is what you've decided yourself…]]></string>
<string id="541051"><![CDATA[And I don't like cowards, liars, and traitors!]]></string>
<string id="541052"><![CDATA[It will fit you nicely, I know that for sure! But what do you need it for?]]></string>
<string id="541053"><![CDATA[I want to kill certain people who really deserve to die. But, being cowards, they're waiting for me. That's why I'd like to sneak up on them unnoticed.]]></string>
<string id="541054"><![CDATA[No! I need nothing from you, demon.]]></string>
<string id="541055"><![CDATA[What do you think this Inquisitor really wants? What's her objective here?]]></string>
<string id="541056"><![CDATA[...You've pierced me right to the heart! Is that really so?]]></string>

<string id="541058"><![CDATA[Save it then. Everything's in your hands now.]]></string>
<string id="541059"><![CDATA[That's why I'm asking you…]]></string>
<string id="541060"><![CDATA[I've been inside. What is it? Who are you harbouring there?]]></string>
<string id="541061"><![CDATA[Much as I'd like to tell you that it's inhabited by my fantasies and my dreams, it would be untrue. Children live there: petty, pathetic, malicious, craving to imitate the grown-ups... But the place improves them, it makes them better, and that's why I don't object... Perhaps one day it will harbour someone's dream...]]></string>
<string id="541062"><![CDATA[What's so bad about the children's dreams?]]></string>
<string id="541063"><![CDATA[Take a look outside. That's what's bad about them... Every child is capable of crossing over to the other side of reality, but few are able to bring back something beautiful, good, and... magical. No, the Tower is not for children... It's for lovers, dreamers, and poets.]]></string>

<string id="541065"><![CDATA[Now I understand completely!]]></string>
<string id="541066"><![CDATA[You're mistaking me for someone else... just as you did back then.]]></string>
<string id="541067"><![CDATA[Because he wants to leave it in a void, in icy solitude... like a unique butterfly preserved in formalin, pinned to the Steppe like to a piece of cardboard! No, I don't want that to happen! Who needs a victory like that…]]></string>
<string id="541068"><![CDATA[Don't despair, Andrey... You're making a mistake by not trusting me.]]></string>

<string id="541077"><![CDATA[I need you to stay here for at least an hour. Two would be even better. And it would be best for you to stay put until you're paid a visit…]]></string>

<string id="541079"><![CDATA[He is, Haruspex... But they can't strike you—so why would you need them if not to kill them?]]></string>

<string id="541081"><![CDATA[And why would you warn me? You know full well there aren't many reasons for me to trust you… ]]></string>
<string id="541082"><![CDATA[I'm warning you so that you have more. It's high time you realized not only evil walks this earth!]]></string>
<string id="541083"><![CDATA[Aglaya asked me to, Burakh... She's worried about you.]]></string>
<string id="541084"><![CDATA[I see…]]></string>

<string id="541093"><![CDATA[You are looking for the miracle-maker. It's not me. So do you want me to show you where she is?]]></string>
<string id="541094"><![CDATA[…Tell me where she is.]]></string>
<string id="541095"><![CDATA[With a scalpel, as usual. But he's accompanied by his Kin slaves. They obey him now. Aspity provided him with an entourage!]]></string>

<string id="541117"><![CDATA[...Who told you?]]></string>
<string id="541118"><![CDATA[…Filin, oh Filin, I know of you this: you knew ahead of time about the disaster that was to strike the town. Will you agree to touch me? To brave the depths? To answer my questions candidly and without prejudice?]]></string>
<string id="541119"><![CDATA[…Sure, kiddo, ask away... Where did you get my name, anyway? Did Saburov whisper it to you, the scum?]]></string>
<string id="541120"><![CDATA[You're... not asleep?]]></string>
<string id="541121"><![CDATA[Hey, is that magical? Show me... Why, what's the matter?]]></string>
<string id="541122"><![CDATA[...Gee, would you look at that! Hey villanous lot, you heard the lil' tot? You're not the Mistress of Earth by any chance, are you? Or an inquisitor on an official mission? Eh? Who d'you think you are, you wee lil' Saburov foundling? Lessee what colour your skin is on the inside... Get her!]]></string>
<string id="541123"><![CDATA[I know what colour yours is. Black, Grief... It's black.]]></string>
<string id="541124"><![CDATA[Wha—? Hold on there folks, don't touch her just yet. What did you say? Black? And why is that?]]></string>
<string id="541125"><![CDATA[That's what I'm asking you; why is that?]]></string>
<string id="541126"><![CDATA[The Saburov scum is tryin' to frame me. Knife attacks 'n other kinds of nastiness. Now, can you imagine me cuttin' someone with a knife? Eh? Of course you can't! I'm not guilty of any of that and neither are my lads. Now Saburov, he's not angry on account of the people—just on account of his people... I want to give him the actual cutthroat so that he leaves me alone. I'll clear my own reputation in the process too, so it's a win-win!]]></string>
<string id="541127"><![CDATA[I'll put in a word for you.]]></string>
<string id="541128"><![CDATA[Look at your own fellows standing there—you could run through three people with one of those knives they've got... Are they just a deterrent?]]></string>
<string id="541129"><![CDATA[Yep, they sure are, 'n I can prove it... 'Tis not they who carve people up, all right? Especially not Saburov's people...]]></string>
<string id="541130"><![CDATA[Go ahead. Prove it...]]></string>
<string id="541131"><![CDATA[There's nothing else I need…]]></string>
<string id="541166"><![CDATA[Clara's here... Hi, Clara! So—you're not a Changeling anymore?]]></string>
<string id="541225"><![CDATA[Some trifle! I have a whole nine of them, and I loathe most.]]></string>
<string id="541260"><![CDATA[Right. I forgot.]]></string>
<string id="541281"><![CDATA[Check me. Am I really the disease? ]]></string>
<string id="541282"><![CDATA[No, not you... Oddly enough, I must say.]]></string>
<string id="541283"><![CDATA[Then let me go.]]></string>
<string id="541284"><![CDATA[That is exactly what's about to be ascertained. And you're the only one who can ascertain it. That's the essence of the sacrament. By establishing the present you will establish the past. With that which is yet to be done, you will establish that which has seemed to have been done beforehand. It has only worked the opposite way before.]]></string>
<string id="541285"><![CDATA[Who are you?]]></string>
<string id="541286"><![CDATA[I do exist, sister, but in a transient way. For now, you are still the Disease, and I'm the persecuted saint. The problem is, there's no me yet; I'm a figment of your imagination... A consequence of a lie you told! And yet how wonderful that lie itself turned out to be... Theft had made a miracle possible...]]></string>
<string id="541287"><![CDATA[No... I don't understand. But it was your choice. Neither the Haruspex nor the Bachelor got one like that…]]></string>
<string id="541288"><![CDATA[Farewell, sister.]]></string>
<string id="541289"><![CDATA[Did you hear what I said? I've taken up your burden. There will be a miracle. And you will have to go.]]></string>
<string id="541290"><![CDATA[It couldn't have been any other way, my dear sister. Farewell. I'll take the disease with me as I leave. A lot of evil will be gone from this world along with me.]]></string>
<string id="541291"><![CDATA[So now you're the holy miracle-worker?]]></string>
<string id="541292"><![CDATA[So it would seem, sister. Now that you've acknowledged yourself as an instrument of the Inevitability.]]></string>
<string id="541293"><![CDATA[...And now you're leaving this world forever?]]></string>
<string id="541294"><![CDATA[I was never in it, dear sister. Don't forget, there's just been you all along.]]></string>
<string id="541295"><![CDATA[I know. I'm talking to myself now.]]></string>
<string id="541296"><![CDATA[My choice to be a miracle-worker was a part of their vicious plan too! The miracle had been preordained by them beforehand. They have defiled the nature of the miraculous.]]></string>
<string id="541297"><![CDATA[So you think they've been laughing at us? You think they were sitting there rubbing their hands in anticipation, expecting us to perform a miracle while they knew that the inevitable necessity, which they themselves had created, would not win? You haven't understood a thing... and the truth of my words is confirmed by my still being here...]]></string>
<string id="541298"><![CDATA[Which is how you've overcome your hollowness!]]></string>
<string id="541299"><![CDATA[I don't understand…]]></string>
<string id="541300"><![CDATA[You rejected the stolen fate and became yourself. Well, I have nothing left to do but pick up what you've thrown away. It's my burden now. There's very little time left—but perhaps it will be enough for me... And you have no idea what's happening to me right now.]]></string>
<string id="541301"><![CDATA[...And now you're leaving this world forever?]]></string>
<string id="541302"><![CDATA[I understand! I'm the one who'll leave soon, and you'll stay behind!]]></string>
<string id="541303"><![CDATA[So it shall be. Forgive me.]]></string>
<string id="541304"><![CDATA[But is this doubt that I'm seeing in your eyes?]]></string>
<string id="541306"><![CDATA[Is the burden you've taken not too heavy for you?]]></string>
<string id="541307"><![CDATA[No. Don't ask again. You'll see for yourself soon enough.]]></string>
<string id="541308"><![CDATA[Why are you asking?]]></string>
<string id="541309"><![CDATA[The plague was just a tool. Forget about the evil, and I'll carry it away. But have you understood correctly what the means will be to achieving the genuine miracle that is to take place here? It wasn't the banishing of the disease; that was a mere rehearsal... Do you realize what's being expected of you? Have you chosen rightly, Clara?]]></string>
<string id="541310"><![CDATA[You're the evil spirit now. Temptation, doubt, and equivocacy are your nature. Farewell. I don't wish to listen to you.]]></string>
<string id="541311"><![CDATA[Oh no! You're making me doubt myself again…]]></string>
<string id="541312"><![CDATA[Yes. I'm ready now.]]></string>
<string id="541313"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor insists that miracles and me are mutually exclusive.]]></string>
<string id="541314"><![CDATA[I don't know... I haven't even thought about it. Aglaya doesn't tell the whole truth. From her point of view, there are no such things as miracles; that's just the way she was made. But we—we, not Simon!—are living proof of the contrary. You have a chance to preserve things as they are! You can do what others can't. They're impeded by enmities and hatred.]]></string>
<string id="541315"><![CDATA[Who's enemies with whom, sister?]]></string>
<string id="541316"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor and the Commander. The Haruspex and the Bachelor. And then more conflict across these lines. All of them are bent on destroying what they detest. If you want to perform a miracle, remove the threat to each of the town's organs.]]></string>
<string id="541317"><![CDATA[Now you're tempting me! Do you want me to kill?]]></string>
<string id="541320"><![CDATA[Is it true that I'm an instrument of the Law?]]></string>
<string id="541321"><![CDATA[There really is an envoy of the Law in this town, and it's one of the new arrivals. Is it perhaps the Bachelor or the Haruspex? It's evident that both of them are destroyers. Each of them has already accepted the inevitable. But could it be you? It would make things that much worse...]]></string>
<string id="541322"><![CDATA[How do we find out, then?]]></string>
<string id="541323"><![CDATA[We can't. We can only make it happen. How can I know something that hasn't been done yet? I'm not omnipotent.]]></string>
<string id="541324"><![CDATA[Or aren't you?]]></string>
<string id="541325"><![CDATA[The Inquisitor is convinced of that!]]></string>
<string id="541326"><![CDATA[Are you the plague? Speak!]]></string>
<string id="541327"><![CDATA[What must I do?]]></string>
<string id="541328"><![CDATA[...I'm all enmities and hatred myself!]]></string>
<string id="541330"><![CDATA[But to preserve things as they are is the capricious wish of the criminal Powers That Be!]]></string>
<string id="541331"><![CDATA[You are free to choose your own fate. Now is your time to decide who you've been all along. It's only from the Law's perspective that you're the disease. But you don't recognize the Law. You're a thief. You'll escape the Law by stealing for yourself the path of a miracle-worker. You'll defeat it by performing a genuine miracle...]]></string>
<string id="541332"><![CDATA[If only…]]></string>
<string id="541333"><![CDATA[I still feel like I'm being deceived...]]></string>
<string id="541334"><![CDATA[Enough! Who am I? Speak!]]></string>
<string id="541335"><![CDATA[And you? What's going to happen to you?]]></string>
<string id="541336"><![CDATA[I'll accept the destiny you'll have rejected. And then I'll vanish at once, because I don't belong on this Earth. Go, sister. Make your choice. Do not tarry.]]></string>
<string id="541337"><![CDATA[I'll come back to you yet…]]></string>
<string id="541338"><![CDATA[She was indeed conceived as the disease, an instrument of the Law... but she was born a thief. At the very moment of her birth, she got a chance to become someone completely different. The girl came into this world, having stolen for herself the fate of a miracle-worker.]]></string>
<string id="541339"><![CDATA[Does this mean I'm not a toy? Why are the Powers That Be acting so strangely towards me?]]></string>
<string id="541340"><![CDATA[Why not? The Changeling, not knowing who she was herself, had fallen into our mirror trap. It was a surprise even to the children who were playing with her. So it was a conundrum... why, there's no point in hiding that we hadn't expected it either. So maybe, just maybe...]]></string>
<string id="541341"><![CDATA[How? Hadn't you made provisions for every circumstance beforehand?]]></string>
<string id="541342"><![CDATA[When she first performed a lesser miracle, we were ourselves astounded... We had never thought it could work. It shouldn't have.]]></string>
<string id="541343"><![CDATA[Unbelievable…]]></string>
<string id="541347"><![CDATA[Why did you put me in a position like this? What was that split-personality gimmick all about?]]></string>
<string id="541348"><![CDATA[In fact, it was much gimmickier than a mere split personality. It was the gimmick of choosing one's own fate. A logical and temporal conundrum. A Moebius strip of events. A backup plan. And it seems to have worked. Clara is the game's main protagonist. And so is the Sand Dirt... so is the Utopia.]]></string>
<string id="541349"><![CDATA[What was the point of this whole affair? What was the pestilence for?]]></string>
<string id="541350"><![CDATA[You see, we're conducting an experiment of sorts... We find the inevitability worrying and oppressive. We wanted to see for ourselves just how flawed the idea is of constructing a sarcophagus for a miracle... Or perhaps not a sarcophagus, but a space in which a miracle would always be possible.]]></string>
<string id="541351"><![CDATA[Why "Changeling"?]]></string>
<string id="541352"><![CDATA[Because that's what she is. It's her nature. And she'll stay true to it until the end... Well, almost until the end, seeing as she's the only one with the miracle option. Don't miss it.]]></string>
<string id="541353"><![CDATA[And what about the Haruspex and the Bachelor? What are they for then?]]></string>
<string id="541354"><![CDATA[They haven't performed any miracles, but both had a chance to accomplish a heroic feat of a different sort... And prove or disprove a number of slippery points in the process.]]></string>
<string id="541355"><![CDATA[The Haruspex?]]></string>
<string id="541356"><![CDATA[A heretical aspiration! Who do you think you are?]]></string>
<string id="541357"><![CDATA[This is why the Changeling was conceived as either holy or possessed. Who if not she was to solve this... essentially religious issue!]]></string>
<string id="541358"><![CDATA[The way you're interpreting it, it falls short of counting as religious!]]></string>
<string id="541359"><![CDATA[Amen to that... Still, we reserve our right to experiment.]]></string>
<string id="541360"><![CDATA[So why did you design the Changeling like that?]]></string>
<string id="541361"><![CDATA[Holy or possessed? Is that the same as "thief and miracle-worker"?]]></string>
<string id="541362"><![CDATA[Not quite. A thief is a miracle-worker's equal, whereas holiness is not nearly on the same level as... possession, if that's what we're going to call it; ultimately, it's a question of your freedom or lack thereof.]]></string>
<string id="541363"><![CDATA[So why did you design the Changeling like that?]]></string>
<string id="541364"><![CDATA[I hate your experiments... I find them stupid and naïve.]]></string>
<string id="541365"><![CDATA[Diverging branches. He was the only one who could attain true freedom. He wasn't facing the kind of dilemma that the ever-deceived Bachelor found so dismal.]]></string>
<string id="541366"><![CDATA[What? Even here, you're not letting me go back to the previous selection? I'd be interested to hear about the other hero too…]]></string>
<string id="541367"><![CDATA[Well, sorry... You haven't made your choice yet, have you? The miracle is yet to happen. This was just a reminder.]]></string>
<string id="541368"><![CDATA[The Bachelor?]]></string>
<string id="541369"><![CDATA[A tempted destroyer. He could have accomplished a feat of moral heroism. The strongest, the most straightforward, he was too strongly tempted by vengeance and destruction for his not going through with it to be anything less than... miracle, or something close to one.]]></string>
<string id="541370"><![CDATA[What? Even here, you're not letting me go back to the previous selection? I'd be interested to hear about the other hero too…]]></string>
<string id="541371"><![CDATA[Enough. I'm leaving.]]></string>
<string id="541372"><![CDATA[I think I'll find a way to even up on you too. To rub your nose and walk you into your own trap. Because it's clear to me now what your goals are.]]></string>
<string id="541373"><![CDATA[I think I'll find a way to even up on you too. To rub your nose and walk you into your own trap. Because it's clear to me now what your goals are.]]></string>
<string id="541374"><![CDATA[That would be the outcome we hoped for the most!]]></string>
<string id="541375"><![CDATA[Oh no, don't lie.]]></string>
<string id="541376"><![CDATA[You still don't understand what I'm thinking of now…]]></string>
<string id="541378"><![CDATA[And the sister... Did she really exist?]]></string>
<string id="541379"><![CDATA[Of course not. The same being sang in two different voices. You had made her up yourself—don't you remember when? It was a falsehood…]]></string>
<string id="541380"><![CDATA[Well, the answer has been hinted at…]]></string>
<string id="541381"><![CDATA[Enough! I've seen her; I've talked to her.]]></string>
<string id="541382"><![CDATA[Is this you talking to us now... or not? Who's speaking?]]></string>
<string id="541383"><![CDATA[Me. The Changeling.]]></string>
<string id="541384"><![CDATA[Me. The player.]]></string>
<string id="541385"><![CDATA[Then it shouldn't surprise you that at certain moments you were seeing Clara in front of you. Right?]]></string>
<string id="541386"><![CDATA[Hang on! Here's the important part. Who's she? The twin? The one that doesn't exist?]]></string>
<string id="541387"><![CDATA[Oh, we beg you pardon then. This means we're dealing with a really, really difficult medical case here... There's nothing we can do.]]></string>
<string id="541388"><![CDATA[Hang on! Here's the important part. Who's she? The twin? The one that doesn't exist?]]></string>
<string id="541389"><![CDATA[Seeing as the plague girl invented her in order to save her life and dodge an accusation—she is in fact the saint and miracle-worker.]]></string>
<string id="541390"><![CDATA[Then how can we be talking about anything resembling a choice?]]></string>
<string id="541391"><![CDATA[I see. In fact nothing should've worked for you at all.]]></string>
<string id="541392"><![CDATA[Can a miracle be performed under such conditions?]]></string>
<string id="541393"><![CDATA[I've got an idea of my own on the subject…]]></string>
<string id="541394"><![CDATA[Indeed? As it happens, I've discovered the meaning of my freedom.]]></string>
<string id="541395"><![CDATA[Of course you have. Liar.]]></string>
<string id="541396"><![CDATA[So listen how my plot's unfolded... As you probably know I've been deceived three times by people I sincerely trusted. First the Powers That Be, then the Inquisitor—and now, finally, I've found out what the point of the whole affair is. I'm a plaything! And so, undoubtedly, are you.]]></string>
<string id="541397"><![CDATA[I know already... So what now? I suppose you'll suggest that I leave it to you to decide?]]></string>
<string id="541398"><![CDATA[Of course! How did you know?]]></string>
<string id="541399"><![CDATA[What, for your sake? You're a plaything!]]></string>
<string id="541400"><![CDATA[Really? Then could you please make it so that I could show up at the Council and present the Commander with arguments in favour of the following arrangement: the corrupt town disappears from the face of the earth, and the Polyhedron stays. It's aseptic and... damn it, it's simply worthy of preserving!]]></string>
<string id="541401"><![CDATA[What does that require?]]></string>
<string id="541404"><![CDATA[I wrote to you about them the other day. But in case you lost that letter, I'll tell you how to spot them. They all want one thing, and that's to preserve the marvellous Tower. Nothing else matters to them.]]></string>
<string id="541406"><![CDATA[No. That will not be.]]></string>
<string id="541431"><![CDATA[I'll try to do something. How do I know who your Bound are?]]></string>
<string id="541433"><![CDATA[All right. I'll come. If you tell Block yourself that you're on my side, the Inquisitor will be disarmed.]]></string>
<string id="541446"><![CDATA[It appears that you've been helpful... Without you, Rubin wouldn't have discovered what my calling was.]]></string>
<string id="541455"><![CDATA[Really? Then I could present the Commander with arguments in favour of a proposal that will preserve the town at the cost of destroying the Tower. This is a wise arrangement, and—as my heart tells me—a lasting one. I'm thinking about the future of my community.]]></string>
<string id="541456"><![CDATA[What will you need for it?]]></string>
<string id="541458"><![CDATA[I will. Have you got your panacea?]]></string>
<string id="541459"><![CDATA[I'm out of panacea. I'll have to use the last flask and the last batch of ingredients at the Council, as an argument in favour of my proposal. You don't need it anyway, do you? Isn't it true that you can heal with your hands?]]></string>
<string id="541461"><![CDATA[No. I don't need you at the Cathedral, Burakh. Goodbye.]]></string>
<string id="541486"><![CDATA[You are an instrument of the Law. At least keep that in mind now that you've chanced to be able to make the choice here. Don't try to be something greater than you are. That's the best you could do in your position.]]></string>
<string id="541487"><![CDATA[You're wrong, Aglaya Lilich. I could do a lot in my position.]]></string>
<string id="541488"><![CDATA[But you still want me to topple the Tower in the process, don't you? While I don't think there are any good reasons to do that, other than it being what you insist on…]]></string>
<string id="541489"><![CDATA[...And so you want to destroy the whole town? And that's after all your talk of love, kindness and mercy...]]></string>
<string id="541490"><![CDATA[I agree that an act like that wouldn't befit a saint. But you deny my sainthood, don't you? So your reproach is unfair.]]></string>
<string id="541491"><![CDATA[I am the Sand Fever, an embodiment of the Law. I have begun the culling of this town, and I will complete it. Such is my decision.]]></string>
<string id="541492"><![CDATA[You want to settle scores with me? Is that it?]]></string>
<string id="541493"><![CDATA[I haven't observed any logic in your words and actions, Aglaya Lilich. If I was an instrument of the Law, why did you banish me?]]></string>
<string id="541494"><![CDATA[I have touched you. Tremble. You are condemned.]]></string>
<string id="541495"><![CDATA[Because you had yielded to a temptation. You had embarked on a perverse course of action: to preserve this outrageous synthesis, which is nothing but a death machine—and to add more deaths to the tally for the sake of its preservation! Your words had also led astray the Bachelor and the Haruspex, to whom I had taken such pains to explain the real state of affairs.]]></string>
<string id="541496"><![CDATA[Really? I didn't know that…]]></string>
<string id="541497"><![CDATA[You'll never understand this... because you are a sacrificial victim passionately seeking to avoid her lot. So don't judge your superiors, even though you've been invested with the power to judge and to punish them!]]></string>
<string id="541498"><![CDATA[I haven't settled on my sacrificial victim yet. Keep that in mind. All right?]]></string>
<string id="541499"><![CDATA[What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="541500"><![CDATA[My principal goal is not to destroy the Polyhedron but to heal the town.]]></string>
<string id="541501"><![CDATA[What are you getting at?]]></string>
<string id="541502"><![CDATA[Hence I would recommend you to turn your attention to Dankovsky, who intends to destroy the town. Touch him…]]></string>
<string id="541503"><![CDATA[You are a destroyer and a killer, Burakh. But for me, you would've drowned your town in blood. Was that what you wanted to save it for?]]></string>
<string id="541504"><![CDATA[But I'm not the plague and not a murderer. What's a touch from me going to do to him?]]></string>
<string id="541505"><![CDATA[You're a destroyer. You have a cold heart. You can't fully fathom even the true beauty of that Tower of mirrors, whose nature still eludes you…]]></string>
<string id="541506"><![CDATA[I've made up my own mind already, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="541507"><![CDATA[Yes. I admit I have an ulterior motive here. I'd be glad if I didn't have to wreck the town; I might even believe the Ripper... wild though the idea may be. But the only thing he wants is to remove Aglaya from his prophecy…]]></string>
<string id="541508"><![CDATA[What are you talking about? What prophecy?]]></string>
<string id="541509"><![CDATA[The Kin demands that he kill her. She is his sacrifice. Without it, they won't acknowledge him as a Foreman and Warden... He wants to deceive both them and fate—and to frame the matter differently. He wants to kill the Polyhedron!]]></string>
<string id="541510"><![CDATA[But the only thing you want is to preserve the Polyhedron and destroy Aglaya.]]></string>
<string id="541511"><![CDATA[Yes, I love the Polyhedron. It is alive, no less alive than the Earth, and is worthy of love. It, too, is inhabited by a collective body; it, too, is infused with a divine essence; it, too, is the dwelling-place of a soul, if you like!]]></string>
<string id="541512"><![CDATA[Don't fret, Bachelor. I know what you're driven by.]]></string>
<string id="541513"><![CDATA[What, is it alive? Why do you put it like that?]]></string>
<string id="541514"><![CDATA[This whole town is like a pair of conjoined twins. Everything is alive here. I understand this very well! You can't even imagine how well…]]></string>
<string id="541515"><![CDATA[No, I'm not ready to go outside yet... There will be no turning back. I must make up my mind.]]></string>
<string id="541516"><![CDATA[This person is sick. No, don't blame yourself—that's not your fault. One of your rival counterparts must have overlooked them... or left them on purpose. Nevertheless, no entry. It's under quarantine. I keep a sorrowful watch.]]></string>
<string id="541517"><![CDATA[Can't they be helped?]]></string>
<string id="541518"><![CDATA[Even being one of the Bound, they're just an ordinary person. They can be cured, just like any other. You're the healer here, it's your area of expertise.]]></string>

<string id="541731"><![CDATA[Really? He could have been just tired. He has complained to me about quickly becoming exhausted in our climate.]]></string>
<string id="541732"><![CDATA[Ah, you're joking! And I'm not joking at all. He's an evil demon! Throw me out if you like, but don't trust him!]]></string>
<string id="541733"><![CDATA[But he seemed to immediately despise me.]]></string>
<string id="541734"><![CDATA[Don't worry. His opinion of you, whatever it may be, will not influence mine.]]></string>
<string id="541735"><![CDATA[…Really?]]></string>
<string id="541736"><![CDATA[Why will it always be falling? I'm a good person...]]></string>
<string id="541737"><![CDATA[But people are convinced to the contrary. You will exist in several guises here. The guise that will live in the collective mind—and, one may speculate, the collective memory—is a most terrifying one. Every day, people will witness signs of your otherworldly nature. They will be frightened.]]></string>
<string id="541738"><![CDATA[No! I will be remembered for my mercy! And always spoken of in praise! You'll see!]]></string>
<string id="541739"><![CDATA[Doesn't matter... It won't help them any.]]></string>
<string id="541740"><![CDATA[I know all that! There's no need to teach me the basics.]]></string>
<string id="541742"><![CDATA[Just dropping in... Don't spill the beans yourself!]]></string>
<string id="541743"><![CDATA[I know. I know all that already. Goodbye, good soul.]]></string>
<string id="541744"><![CDATA[I'm stalking for prey. If you don't need this goon, he'll do for me.]]></string>
<string id="541745"><![CDATA[Where are those robbers?]]></string>
<string id="541746"><![CDATA[Over there, next to the cars... Be careful, don't come close! They're wicked good knife-throwers.]]></string>
<string id="541747"><![CDATA[So they stabbed this guttersnipe with a knife?]]></string>
<string id="541748"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="541749"><![CDATA[Looks very suspicious. Unsteady eyes, like he's done something nasty. The kind you can tell is a scoundrel at once. Murmurs something that cannot be understood—threatens to kill somebody. See, he hasn't got the kind of head that honest folk have, either... But he seems more afraid of the Warehouse people than of me. Still, he wouldn't say a word to me.]]></string>

<string id="541754"><![CDATA[Thank you, Grace! I'll stay away from the Works.]]></string>
<string id="541755"><![CDATA[So what did you do to become hunted like that?]]></string>

<string id="541765"><![CDATA[*** ...How do they call upon the menkhu, the faithful of a Warden kin? Known by their hands, for they are butchers; known by their eyes, for they are surgeons; known by their deeds, for they follow the lines.

<string id="541766"><![CDATA[Hang on... What was it you said? "Soul-and-a-Half"?]]></string>
<string id="541767"><![CDATA[Yep.]]></string>
<string id="541768"><![CDATA[How can someone have a soul and a half?]]></string>
<string id="541769"><![CDATA[Some people even have two, but they're freaks. You see, a soul-and-a-half is a monster. A demon, sort of like a hobgoblin or a dust-wraith. That's why he's a monster—because he has more than one soul. That's the idea.]]></string>
<string id="541770"><![CDATA[I see... So—they attacked you? Hurt you?]]></string>
<string id="541771"><![CDATA[So your friends are monsters?]]></string>
<string id="541772"><![CDATA[No, they're a different kind of Soul-and-a-Halves. It's what they named themselves to make the Dogheads afraid of them. Not that anyone is afraid of them, of course. Our might will crush them all! Actually, the reason for the name is that they've each got a Half. A little pet familiar. That's who they get the extra soulage from. And boy do they adore the little beasts!]]></string>
<string id="541773"><![CDATA[...My heart is beating so fast now... Why would that be? Or have I felt this before?]]></string>
<string id="541774"><![CDATA[And what did you do to make them throw you out?]]></string>

<string id="541776"><![CDATA[You're a real scoundrel, aren't you...]]></string>
<string id="541777"><![CDATA[Why so?]]></string>
<string id="541778"><![CDATA[Why? Because first I get chased away into the Steppe by my Soul-and-a-Half mates—and then I run into a Ripper there to boot. Boy was I begging him to let me go—but the bastard knew what I'd been picked on for, then pulled out his knife, and here I am, carved up like so much fillet. It hurts. Help me, will you?]]></string>
<string id="541779"><![CDATA[Poor thing... Come on, come to me, let me touch you with my hands. You'll feel better.]]></string>

<string id="541784"><![CDATA[That's what I've heard from the people who were robbing the dead at the station. Be careful, if they find out you gave him shelter, they'll come for you too...]]></string>
<string id="541785"><![CDATA[No one would dare to touch me... least of all a robber. There's no one villainous enough here to pull a knife to me... That's what my father used to tell me—and that's how it's always been.]]></string>

<string id="541787"><![CDATA[Why do they honour you so much?]]></string>

<string id="541792"><![CDATA[…Death?]]></string>
<string id="541793"><![CDATA[No. Leaning over the wounded worker was the scary man who'd inflicted all those wounds on him in the first place. I asked him not to kill the workman, but to heal him with living blood instead. And he, the scary one, said nothing for a long time—there was just the sound of his wheezy breath—but then he took the workman and dragged him off somewhere. To his den, he said...]]></string>
<string id="541794"><![CDATA[A robber?]]></string>
<string id="541795"><![CDATA[You have to have the blood of a man who is still alive and walks the earth. Infusing this blood into a wounded man's veins, if done right, will be beneficial.]]></string>

<string id="541797"><![CDATA[I need him.]]></string>
<string id="541798"><![CDATA[What do you mean, vanished?]]></string>
<string id="541799"><![CDATA[I brought the wounded man here. Examined him. He was beyond hope. Then I went to get... my tools. When I came back he was gone. That was ten minutes ago. The trail of blood led back to the town. I saw blood on the embankment too, but that doesn't tell us a lot. So I've lost him. Where could he go?]]></string>
<string id="541800"><![CDATA[And what were you intending to do to him, you cruel man? He was still alive, wasn't he?]]></string>
<string id="541801"><![CDATA[I'll look for him on the embankment. He may have found shelter at one of the houses.]]></string>
<string id="541802"><![CDATA[You fear me, Ripper. And rightly so. You must already feel that I'll be the undoing of your gory plans.]]></string>

<string id="541899"><![CDATA[It means that this is your nature. It means that this is your preordainment.

<string id="541907"><![CDATA[Yes, they're hopeless. The issue is moot in their case. They never had an alternative—having never reached that degree of complexity.

<string id="541954"><![CDATA[I was just expressing my sympathy for you…]]></string>
<string id="541955"><![CDATA[I'm glad the demon is dead.]]></string>
<string id="541956"><![CDATA[People tend to demonize what they can't understand... You see a twisted image of yourself in your counterparts... more powerful, while also badly damaged... You don't understand how the two qualities combine. But you're wrong. How is he a demon, silly? He is just like you.]]></string>
<string id="541957"><![CDATA[I don't think so. He's not a miracle-worker. I mean, was not.]]></string>
<string id="541958"><![CDATA[Actually you're right... But that changes nothing.]]></string>
<string id="541959"><![CDATA[Of course you just thought you saw them. What could possibly happen to me?]]></string>
<string id="541960"><![CDATA[What, what is it? I don't see my soles…]]></string>
<string id="541961"><![CDATA[Here's the plan for today. You will go to the Kains and find out why this perverted Polyhedron is so precious to them. Same pretext: say I'm accusing them of starting the epidemic. The "it's a work of art" evasion is no longer an acceptable answer.]]></string>
<string id="541962"><![CDATA[And why would it be unacceptable? How is it not a work of art? If I had a tower like that it would be precious to me too!]]></string>
<string id="541963"><![CDATA[The Bachelor is already working on this theory. What I need is mysticism. He doesn't understand it; you will. Even if you won't, you'll still be able to passably communicate it to me. Any more questions?]]></string>
<string id="541964"><![CDATA[How many questions can I ask now?]]></string>
<string id="541965"><![CDATA[No. No questions. I just need to be myself, right? Well, I'm going…]]></string>
<string id="541966"><![CDATA[Who am I?]]></string>
<string id="541967"><![CDATA[I haven't understood it yet, my dear... Perhaps you will bring me the answer today, on the soles of your shoes... Have you ever seen them? They're most curious. Every time you walk away, I look at your feet... a very interesting view!]]></string>
<string id="541968"><![CDATA[Don't make fun of me... Is this the final test?]]></string>
<string id="541969"><![CDATA[You are afraid of me, Aglaya, aren't you... That's why you haven't killed me yet. Afraid that if you do, something will be irretrievably broken, right?]]></string>
<string id="541970"><![CDATA[I'm just not cut out for having a fate at all.]]></string>
<string id="541971"><![CDATA[No. It's not like that. I even like the Polyhedron. I now like whatever you hate!]]></string>
<string id="541972"><![CDATA[Well, so what have I found out? I doubt you know what I know now. Or else we'd be seeing less arrogance out of you... you plaything.]]></string>
<string id="541973"><![CDATA[Why, no offence taken. A typical example of rushing to conclusions. You're behind the times. Truths like the one you just presented me with are no longer fashionable. That's more in the Bachelor and Haruspex's line... By the way, don't give them hints if you meet them. Let them work it out on their own.]]></string>
<string id="541974"><![CDATA[All right. So what have you found out?]]></string>
<string id="541975"><![CDATA[Well, sum it up. And I've already found a path to victory... All these simulacra, these reflections of reflections shall confuse me no longer. I am firm in my faith! And I am free.]]></string>
<string id="541976"><![CDATA[Oh indeed?]]></string>
<string id="541977"><![CDATA[So tell me... where did I come from? Speak, dummy. Try to talk me to death.]]></string>
<string id="541978"><![CDATA[I don't need your truths. Goodbye, Aglaya Lilich. I've alredy realized how to perform a miracle that will convince you... forever.]]></string>
<string id="541979"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="541980"><![CDATA[People aren't inclined to be on good terms with their own history—yet in this particular town, the impossible happened: the people prevailed over the power structures.]]></string>
<string id="541981"><![CDATA[How did it happen?]]></string>
<string id="541982"><![CDATA[You couldn't tell by looking at them... I can see you've only been interrogating aristocrats—for the common folk, you're completely unconcerned!]]></string>
<string id="541983"><![CDATA[I didn't say their lives were easy or prosperous. I said they were happy. The common folk will tell you the same. The well-off are never satisfied. The local rulers had understood or sensed it. They were truly extraordinary people, and they took a creative approach to the problem of universal happiness.]]></string>
<string id="541984"><![CDATA[How?]]></string>
<string id="541985"><![CDATA[It was a joke, obviously. Do you seriously think I would interpret mythical figures literally? That said, there's definitely something... obscure about you. I can't get rid of a gnawing feeling that as I stand here looking into your eyes, you're simultaneously staring at the back of my head.]]></string>
<string id="541986"><![CDATA[That's because I'm an... unusual kind of girl. This must be a bad time for me to turn up, right?]]></string>
<string id="541987"><![CDATA[Is that so? That explains a lot... So you have supernatural abilities?]]></string>
<string id="541988"><![CDATA[Not exactly... I'm no sorceress. I comfort people. That's why they trust me.]]></string>
<string id="541989"><![CDATA[An epidemic? No. I know nothing about it…]]></string>
<string id="541990"><![CDATA[Then listen. Due to the threat of an epidemic, our town's ruling families have divided certain burdensome duties among themselves. Bachelor Dankovsky has asked our family to take charge of setting up special facilities... as well as commandeering medical supplies.]]></string>
<string id="541991"><![CDATA[Oh yes, all that medicine will be of no use to her.]]></string>
<string id="541992"><![CDATA[I don't want to force her to surrender it.  After all... with the kind of relationship that we have, I can't afford to be rude or intimidating. And you seem capable of being really persuasive. So persuade Anna to donate her stockpile... voluntarily! She doesn't need that much anyway; It's more like compulsive hoarding at this point.]]></string>
<string id="541993"><![CDATA[A creature more terrifying than anything you'd see in a nightmare. It's not alive, but pretends to be so. It has no will of its own, but acts with a lot of resolve. The Earth brings it forth from time to time, fashioning it out of the bones of the dead. It had magical abilities and often assumes a human shape.]]></string>
<string id="541994"><![CDATA[Do I look even remotely like it? You hurt me… a lot!]]></string>
<string id="541995"><![CDATA[What is its purpose?]]></string>
<string id="541996"><![CDATA[The Earth fashions it when angered by men. In the old myths, the Earth would grow angry from hunger. And it would get hungry when the dead weren't buried in it. The people of the Steppe honour only the most righteous with that... So... you can guess the rest. The creature would appear in times of lawlessness. To kill, of course. Which is why they call it—call her—a Maneater.]]></string>
<string id="541997"><![CDATA[You're saying that... a creature made of bones and clay can have warm lips, soft skin, and silky hair?]]></string>
<string id="541998"><![CDATA[Oh, that's just my sister... I see her eyes too when I look at you. She can also do many things that ordinary people can't. She's my twin, after all.]]></string>
<string id="541999"><![CDATA[By the way, since you're such a master of good deeds, would you like to do something really beneficial?]]></string>
<string id="542000"><![CDATA[Why not? Tell me.]]></string>
<string id="542001"><![CDATA[Those were your own words. Why ask me?]]></string>
<string id="542002"><![CDATA[That's the reason I'm here.]]></string>
<string id="542003"><![CDATA[What is that supposed to mean? Explain yourself. Are you saying that you're the cause of the disease?]]></string>
<string id="542004"><![CDATA[No. Quite the contrary! I strive to be a source of good and good only.]]></string>
<string id="542005"><![CDATA[Oh how your eyes light up! Let me guess... Yes, you thought you were the guiltiest party right up to this moment. And now you're hoping to find a more convenient culprit!]]></string>
<string id="542006"><![CDATA[You're a good psychologist... But if you thought you could intimidate me, you thought wrong. Both my conscience and the things that weigh down on it aren't nearly as big as they might seem at first glance. You shouldn't have fallen out with me so soon…]]></string>
<string id="542007"><![CDATA[I will come again. And then we'll have a frank conversation. It will ease your mind, I promise…]]></string>
<string id="542008"><![CDATA[Wait, wait... Let's not quarrel... Be nice, and I'll help you. All right?]]></string>
<string id="542009"><![CDATA[No. I don't think it's going to be a good deed at all. You shouldn't try to deceive me. I can see it all in your eyes.]]></string>
<string id="542010"><![CDATA[A very wise decision.]]></string>
<string id="542011"><![CDATA[You think? Well, perhaps... So the thing is, the town's short on medicine. We're scraping together what little we can. But there's a certain someone who's been stockpiling various drugs for five years by now... A young singer named Anna Angel.]]></string>
<string id="542012"><![CDATA[That won't help. A completely pointless idea.]]></string>
<string id="542013"><![CDATA[Strange girl... You act as if you're well-informed about what's going to happen to us. I hope you realize how suspicious this looks. Or do you flaunt your knowledge so openly because Saburov is in charge of punitive actions?]]></string>
<string id="542014"><![CDATA[No, no, it's not what it looks like! I just... blurted it out before I knew any better! Must have been a premonition. I told you I'm a little... distracted. Some would say batty.]]></string>
<string id="542015"><![CDATA[You fool! It's exactly because the Saburovs are destined to… take charge of punitive actions, that I found shelter under their roof. Farewell.]]></string>
<string id="542016"><![CDATA[A singer? Young singers tend to be blithe. What's up with her? Odd, very odd…]]></string>
<string id="542017"><![CDATA[There could be some foul play involved... But I don't think she knew or prepared anything beforehand... It's just that she lives in the Hindquarters, in Earth... A few years ago, there was a really bad outbreak right nearby. She's been buying up medicine since then.]]></string>
<string id="542018"><![CDATA[How do you know that?]]></string>
<string id="542019"><![CDATA[And so?]]></string>
<string id="542020"><![CDATA[Well, she's been spending every last coin at the pharmacy for the past five years. She visits every pharmacy in the town on Wednesdays, buying heaps of whatever new medicine hits the market. Hard to ignore, you know.]]></string>
<string id="542021"><![CDATA[And you're going to take her stockpile away?]]></string>
<string id="542022"><![CDATA[What's so strange about it?]]></string>
<string id="542023"><![CDATA[You know what just occurred to me? That she's already taken care of my father.]]></string>
<string id="542024"><![CDATA[Isn't it the other way around? Nevermind, just kidding... So he advised you to ask me? Crafty, that... I've underestimated him. So essentially, he wants to do me a favour by getting this monster out of our way?]]></string>
<string id="542025"><![CDATA[She's a monster?]]></string>
<string id="542032"><![CDATA[Yes, that's right... Curious now, aren't you? No, Anna's not someone to suspect of starting the outbreak. Did she give up her stash?]]></string>
<string id="542033"><![CDATA[Like she had a choice! Of course she did.]]></string>
<string id="542034"><![CDATA[How did you manage that?]]></string>
<string id="542035"><![CDATA[I explained to her that none of it would help anyway.]]></string>
<string id="542036"><![CDATA[If it's true, Anna deserves to be left alone for providing valuable information. But that Anna is a crafty and dangerous beast... The offspring of a cat and a serpent—that's what her totemic ancestor was. But you won't find any proof. He's not going to succeed.]]></string>
<string id="542037"><![CDATA[He loved Nina?]]></string>
<string id="542038"><![CDATA[He did. ]]></string>
<string id="542039"><![CDATA[So he pierced the town's heart with a sting for her sake?]]></string>
<string id="542040"><![CDATA[Can't you see the chimney? There it is!]]></string>
<string id="542041"><![CDATA[I can't. I'm not too impressive in the height department, as you can see.]]></string>
<string id="542042"><![CDATA[Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="542043"><![CDATA[Ugh... That's horrible! Do you think he's dangerous?]]></string>
<string id="542044"><![CDATA[What? No... he's dead already. Although they say the dead are even more dangerous than the living! Especially if they decide to forever haunt those who'd slighted them before they died…]]></string>
<string id="542045"><![CDATA[No, I mean the Bachelor! I dread him for some reason... an inexplicable fear, like a premonition. He's not a turnskin, is he?]]></string>
<string id="542046"><![CDATA[So... the living are much more dangerous than the dead after all. But these ones seem kind…]]></string>
<string id="542047"><![CDATA[Are you talking about the Bachelor? I find him menacing too…]]></string>
<string id="542048"><![CDATA[He doesn't look cruel... You think he's the actual monster from the Steppe, whose coming was announced today? The terrible doll made of human bones? No, I don't think so. The shabnak always seeks to assume the shape of a woman.]]></string>
<string id="542050"><![CDATA[Yes, it's those exact bones that I feel in him! He's somehow... not real. Like an animated strawman.]]></string>
<string id="542051"><![CDATA[Don't you argue with him, though! He represents the Law now! And the Law is not on our side.]]></string>
<string id="542052"><![CDATA[What? The Law?]]></string>
<string id="542053"><![CDATA[I didn't know it myself…]]></string>
<string id="542054"><![CDATA[By the way, he's still looking for that wounded man... He'll get here sooner or later.]]></string>
<string id="542056"><![CDATA[Trying to mess with my head, are you, dear...? Want to lead me straight into the rogues' den? There's no way I'd go there.]]></string>
<string id="542062"><![CDATA[Don't be silly. Children aren't evil; it's not in their nature. No, Anna, evil comes from elsewhere...]]></string>
<string id="542064"><![CDATA[So what if he did? Why is it making you so anxious? Surely you won't be mistaken for some homeless boy, what with this mansion of yours. Hmm?]]></string>
<string id="542065"><![CDATA[Yes, of course... But perhaps he didn't kill that boy after all... Then... then things aren't so terrible. Clara, do me a favour please! I really need to know if that crime has actually been committed. I mean, to know whether he really is... that cruel. Please!]]></string>
<string id="542067"><![CDATA[There's nothing worse than a crime against a child! Especially in this town... Only a stranger could be capable of such a savage crime. Any local would know how the Kains would react to something like that—especially the younger ones!]]></string>
<string id="542068"><![CDATA[Anna dear, it wasn't you who killed him... What are you so afraid of? No matter how brutal this murderer is, he's a threat to everyone equally. Trust me...]]></string>
<string id="542069"><![CDATA[Yes, this is terrible... monstrous.]]></string>
<string id="542070"><![CDATA[Don't worry. It wasn't he who killed the homeless boy. It's not this neighbour of yours that you ought to be afraid of… Anna Angel.]]></string>
<string id="542071"><![CDATA[So it's the Kains' reaction you're worried about, huh? And here I almost thought you were upset about the boy...]]></string>
<string id="542072"><![CDATA[Well... The Haruspex let the homeless boy go.]]></string>
<string id="542073"><![CDATA[Oh. Thank goodness. But perhaps he didn't do it out of kindness of heart? Did he?]]></string>
<string id="542074"><![CDATA[Good heavens... So it's true.]]></string>
<string id="542075"><![CDATA[Looks like you're not particularly interested in who killed him. So it's not the Haruspex that you were afraid of…]]></string>
<string id="542076"><![CDATA[It was I who severed his life's thread, Anna Angel. Remember it. Goodbye.]]></string>
<string id="542077"><![CDATA[Quite likely not... It must have been a calculated move. He was afraid that another murder would make his existence in this town impossible.]]></string>
<string id="542078"><![CDATA[Who knows... Maybe it was kindness. Time will tell who's evil and who's good... And we won't have to wait long now. Be patient.]]></string>
<string id="542079"><![CDATA[It was so wonderful... Why is this even happening?]]></string>
<string id="542080"><![CDATA[You're lying; I can't hear a thing. It's empty and silent, as it always is.]]></string>
<string id="542081"><![CDATA[It may be empty now... but the Bachelor will see to it that it will soon be just as I've described, I promise you that. I for one can hear the screaming already. Don't know about you…]]></string>
<string id="542082"><![CDATA[I've always said that this Bachelor is a bringer of death!]]></string>
<string id="542083"><![CDATA[So can I! I always know more than you do.]]></string>
<string id="542084"><![CDATA[May be, may well be…]]></string>
<string id="542085"><![CDATA[Call for Mark. I need to talk to him.]]></string>
<string id="542086"><![CDATA[*** It didn't work out. I was silly to let it out...]]></string>
<string id="542087"><![CDATA[Are you telling the truth?]]></string>
<string id="542088"><![CDATA[I always tell the truth.]]></string>
<string id="542090"><![CDATA[Check for yourself if you don't believe me.]]></string>
<string id="542091"><![CDATA[How come?]]></string>
<string id="542092"><![CDATA[I can't tell you yet, but I will later. So many things are mixed up here, one doesn't know who to fear more... So you're with the Saburovs now, right? Good... you'll be safe with them, and the children won't hurt you. Here, I've got a present for you.]]></string>
<string id="542093"><![CDATA[No. I prefer to keep clear of beasts…]]></string>
<string id="542094"><![CDATA[Have you been crying? Don't hold back if you want to cry... It's nothing to be ashamed of.]]></string>
<string id="542095"><![CDATA[*** As ever, my tongue runs ahead of my reasoning! So many times have I promised myself to keep mum; to let the others talk... It wouldn't work anymore, even though it seems there may be a silver lining to this cloud.]]></string>
<string id="542096"><![CDATA[If I have a what?]]></string>
<string id="542097"><![CDATA[Look. I can work miracles with my own hands.]]></string>
<string id="542098"><![CDATA[]]></string>
<string id="542099"><![CDATA[You're dropping in quite often now... This is a dangerous place for a girl who doesn't cover her knees. Also, too many temptations here for a saint. And finally, this is as goddamn unfitting a place as any for Lady Plague to be in! Way overcrowded, ha ha... How can I help you?]]></string>
<string id="542100"><![CDATA[I've brought you some herbs... Take a look and see if they're any good. And give me one of those bottles over there…]]></string>
<string id="542101"><![CDATA[I've come to like the smell. I enjoy breathing your air.]]></string>
<string id="542102"><![CDATA[Do you intend to hide in here? Pour wine over your dead, play leap-frog with corpses? This debauchery will not be without consequence! Pray…]]></string>
<string id="542103"><![CDATA[You've acquired a taste, then? I should never have shown you that path... messes too much with a head as young as yours. It's a part of you forever now. Anyway, no need to regret it. What have you got?]]></string>
<string id="542104"><![CDATA[Don't grin like that. It's not for me.]]></string>
<string id="542105"><![CDATA[I don't regret it. Your herb has no effect on me.]]></string>
<string id="542106"><![CDATA[No! I don't have any medicine. When I was young, I used to play at the house of a wicked witch—now that's who had a real stash, for every disease... She lived for a hundred years. Her place had that pharmacy smell everywhere! Do you take me for someone like that crone? Nonsense!]]></string>
<string id="542107"><![CDATA[Don't lie to me, Anna. I even know where you keep it. Why are you trying to deceive me?]]></string>
<string id="542108"><![CDATA[Oh, what a pain... This is surely a plot against me... They want to kill me, destroy my life, send me to an early grave. An early grave, yes... Listen! I don't want some disease to eat me alive, to ruin my skin... Leave me that if nothing else, or just shoot me with a gun!]]></string>
<string id="542109"><![CDATA[It's not their fault, Anna. It was an order.]]></string>
<string id="542110"><![CDATA[All right, I'll tell the Olgimskys then that you have nothing. Right?]]></string>
<string id="542111"><![CDATA[Give them at least some of it. Leave the best-looking ones for yourself. I think that's a good idea. Isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="542112"><![CDATA[Did you say they require blood?]]></string>
<string id="542113"><![CDATA[Your Ripper, that's who.]]></string>
<string id="542114"><![CDATA["Our" Ripper? Ah... you mean Young Burakh? Sadly, that's a misconception. I used to think so too. I wanted to get as many twyrine infusions out of him as possible... they're priceless! His father had been a respected man who knew his trade... This one, though, doesn't know a thing.]]></string>
<string id="542115"><![CDATA[Are you sure?]]></string>
<string id="542116"><![CDATA[Quite. When I brought him to Isidor's workshop, he didn't even know how to use a distiller and just stood there gaping at it. He doesn't know what twyre is. How can someone like that be a knower of root knots and grass fibers? Even the Stamatins by now have more knowledge of herbs than him. Amateurs... the plague take them!]]></string>
<string id="542117"><![CDATA[Yes, you've convinced me! But there's no need to say it like that. Especially now. It's too... dangerous.]]></string>
<string id="542118"><![CDATA[Right. What about Anna, then?]]></string>
<string id="542119"><![CDATA[Don't underestimate intuition. He may be following a gut feeling…]]></string>
<string id="542120"><![CDATA[I was just lucky.]]></string>
<string id="542122"><![CDATA[Is that true?]]></string>
<string id="542123"><![CDATA[Yes.]]></string>
<string id="542124"><![CDATA[How do you know?]]></string>
<string id="542125"><![CDATA[So you still haven't realized who I am? Are you not surprised that she gave me all of it so easily?]]></string>
<string id="542126"><![CDATA[I don't know... But it does feel that way. Why have you suddenly turned so pale?]]></string>
<string id="542127"><![CDATA[But you knew it as early as yesterday... didn't you? Was that why you sent me to that uncanny place with the old necromancer and his niece?]]></string>
<string id="542128"><![CDATA[This is not a request. It is an ordainment. What made you reconsider?]]></string>
<string id="542129"><![CDATA[I've concluded that no evil can come from decisions that I make. So I will make decisions.]]></string>
<string id="542130"><![CDATA[Good. We shall begin with a mysterious creature named Aspity. I will show you where she lives.]]></string>
<string id="542131"><![CDATA[There's no need. I know it all anyway…]]></string>
<string id="542132"><![CDATA[Seems like fate wants it this way.]]></string>
<string id="542133"><![CDATA[Why her? Who is she?]]></string>
<string id="542134"><![CDATA[The question is not who, but what. Children say she is an evil spirit. Simon didn't like her. That bitch has been called a walking plague even before this. I'm sure that a woman, a maneater, and a spawn of the Steppe—which is exactly what a shabnak is—is a fitting description for her.]]></string>
<string id="542135"><![CDATA[If so, she's in for it.]]></string>
<string id="542136"><![CDATA[Asps, spite, and spit.]]></string>
<string id="542137"><![CDATA[What is your verdict, then? Is she guilty?]]></string>
<string id="542138"><![CDATA[Nothing. She has no soul.]]></string>
<string id="542139"><![CDATA[I couldn't decide... But I did feel our souls had something in common!]]></string>
<string id="542140"><![CDATA[...I saw this coming. Just thinking about the consequences of your alliance sends shivers down my spine... So what now? I suppose your friend will tell you everything herself, especially considering your talents. Or am I getting the wrong idea about the nuances of your cordial relationship?]]></string>
<string id="542141"><![CDATA[You hate her, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="542143"><![CDATA[My new father has more important things on his plate than doing you favours!]]></string>
<string id="542144"><![CDATA[Aha! So they've adopted you? That's symbolic... Well, if not me, how about doing a favour to my father? After all, your—ehm—father is not the governor yet... and hopefully will never be. So Saburov could do with my father owing him a favour.]]></string>
<string id="542145"><![CDATA[She scares me, plain and simple. My father, on the other hand, truly hates her. The fact that she's still alive has made me reconsider how I feel about my father... It turns out he's much kinder than I thought.]]></string>

<string id="542147"><![CDATA[So what did Aspity do to displease your father so much?]]></string>
<string id="542148"><![CDATA[*** I lost my temper there for a moment... Where am I supposed to find a bull now? At least, it feels like I did the right thing. Dealing with this Changeling may be bad for one's health...]]></string>
<string id="542150"><![CDATA[So she's out to destroy your family, but is wiping out the Kin instead?]]></string>
<string id="542151"><![CDATA[If we knew for sure that she's the one stirring up the Worms, butchers, and workmen, we'd make short work of her. Saburov would not object, nor would Judge Kain take a break from his indifference. But you see, I'm a sensible man... and deep down, I'm convinced she's just an ordinary dirty lowlife.]]></string>
<string id="542152"><![CDATA[Have you met her?]]></string>
<string id="542153"><![CDATA[Once. Her face left quite an impression and so did her speech. That sing-song drawl, that guttural accent of the Steppe... Fascinating. On the whole, she looked rather uncanny. But I thought back then it was just something she was doing for effect. My sister also thinks she's just a vagabond girl obsessing over demonic dreams.]]></string>

<string id="542155"><![CDATA[What do you mean?]]></string>
<string id="542156"><![CDATA[Exactly that! Yes, yes... there's a reason things have been going the way they have! And that horrible thing at the Termitary... Yes, she's aimed a battering ram at him that will strike him down any time now. And now she's shifted her attention to me. That's what's happening! Should I warn him...? I don't like this... but he's angry at me...]]></string>
<string id="542157"><![CDATA[I'll tell him what you said when I get the opportunity.]]></string>

<string id="542183"><![CDATA[Look, that's enough. You're being obnoxious. Are you trying to bewitch me? Would you like to see me try that too—the way I do it with creatures like your little self? Careful, Clara, my child; you may go missing…]]></string>

<string id="542187"><![CDATA[Why, I've made friends with you already... only you don't know it yet. The one I've made friends with, my very own sister, isn't the person to disown our kinship.

<string id="542201"><![CDATA[Beware of the sister, Aspity dear... She'll come back here as soon as I leave.]]></string>
<string id="542202"><![CDATA[Out.]]></string>
<string id="542203"><![CDATA[All right, I'm leaving.]]></string>
<string id="542204"><![CDATA[Did you... did you cause the epidemic?]]></string>
<string id="542205"><![CDATA[...The shabnak-adyr exists? Is it you?]]></string>
<string id="542206"><![CDATA[I see. You may wake up.]]></string>
<string id="542207"><![CDATA[That's what you all say... Let's just make our acquaintance for now.]]></string>
<string id="542208"><![CDATA[Who you are is no secret. It was you that sat on Simon's chest last night. It was you that Isidor had warned him about. Tell me, why were you so cruel to him? Why did you not let him pass away with the same noble and majestic countenance that he had worn among the living?]]></string>
<string id="542209"><![CDATA[Is this a joke? I'm not death! Don't worry…]]></string>
<string id="542210"><![CDATA[I am quite unafraid of you. In fact, I even entertain a degree of pity for you. Do you realize how dangerous the walls of our house are to you?]]></string>
<string id="542211"><![CDATA[Yes. I feel fear and I can't explain it.]]></string>
<string id="542212"><![CDATA[Are you that sure of yourself?]]></string>
<string id="542213"><![CDATA[Maria is near. Her mere proximity will turn you to ashes once she ascends to the fullness of her powers. And that will be soon. You are probably feeling the pain already... akin to a deadly radiation turning your bones into porous lime... Am I right?]]></string>
<string id="542214"><![CDATA[Why are you so calm, Kain? Could it be you've planned something cunning against me, you heretic utopians?]]></string>
<string id="542215"><![CDATA[Is she a witch? I can't think of any other reason for her to hate me... The power that guides the palms of my hands is a benign power. There's no doubt of that.]]></string>
<string id="542216"><![CDATA[Yes... I can feel her proximity destroying me... but I don't believe she'll win.]]></string>
<string id="542217"><![CDATA[Saddened though I am on Simon's account, I am nonetheless not so foolish as to be angry with you. Only a fool would curse and threaten the wind that has torn the sail off his mast. Besides, unlike Georgiy, I profoundly doubt the imminence of your victory.]]></string>
<string id="542218"><![CDATA[I feel sorry for him too... And I feel sorry for all of you. That's easy to understand... But why should you pity me?]]></string>
<string id="542219"><![CDATA[Yes... wind is sent from heaven. All that matters is not to sail against it.]]></string>
<string id="542220"><![CDATA[I don't know anything about myself either…]]></string>
<string id="542221"><![CDATA[Because I don't want you to doubt in my good intentions.]]></string>
<string id="542222"><![CDATA[Because I want him to be buried in the earth.]]></string>
<string id="542223"><![CDATA[If you know where Simon's body is being hidden, it ought to look quite suspicious to us. You must have been pursuing your own goals, I suppose; ritual ones. We are not merely talking about a body of a dearly departed. Do you understand that?]]></string>
<string id="542224"><![CDATA[Are you from the Steppe? I mean, a pagan?]]></string>
<string id="542225"><![CDATA[No! Quite the contrary...]]></string>
<string id="542226"><![CDATA[Yes. I want the earth to have her due.]]></string>
<string id="542227"><![CDATA[Of course I do! I know what a semblance is.]]></string>
<string id="542228"><![CDATA[I understand. And so—where is the body?]]></string>
<string id="542229"><![CDATA[Do you understand the risk I was taking coming here? You were right, you know... about the rays.]]></string>
<string id="542230"><![CDATA[Your words sound wise and quite fair. You evidently know what you are talking about. The destruction of Simon's body would inevitably lead to the destruction of our entire town. But now that the body has been found—we will try and use all of our influence to save the town... one way or another.]]></string>
<string id="542231"><![CDATA[So what do you think I would've done had I been who your crown-bearing daughter thinks I am?]]></string>
<string id="542232"><![CDATA[Whatever has happened or will happen to Simon is going to impact the universe. That's what you believe.]]></string>
<string id="542233"><![CDATA[So you know already?]]></string>
<string id="542234"><![CDATA[Like I said, we know everything already. But it is good that you have come. My brother is very angry and prejudiced against you. And as for me, I will now think twice before believing any of the things you are accused of. She who you are being mistaken for would indeed never have given us the body.]]></string>
<string id="542235"><![CDATA[This is making me dizzy... So... you engineered all of this from the very beginning?]]></string>
<string id="542236"><![CDATA[...Was this a test?]]></string>
<string id="542237"><![CDATA[No. It's not like this. Take some money. This is all I can do to reward you for now. Aside from trusting you, of course.]]></string>
<string id="542238"><![CDATA[I know, but I can't tell you…]]></string>
<string id="542239"><![CDATA[You are already the talk of the town. Wicked people are afraid of you. And not just the wicked people. You inspire fear... in many, my dear daughter. ]]></string>
<string id="542240"><![CDATA[Yes. Rather a lot...  All those places to visit. I had to go everywhere. And observe everything.]]></string>
<string id="542241"><![CDATA[Yes... I understand... Will you tell me about it?]]></string>
<string id="542242"><![CDATA[I don't think I should... I really don't. You don't need to hear about any of that... my dear father and protector!]]></string>
<string id="542243"><![CDATA[…Are you willing to continue helping me in the future?]]></string>
<string id="542244"><![CDATA[I can see this is not what you want to ask me about... Has something happened?]]></string>
<string id="542245"><![CDATA[Are you finding it difficult to talk to me, father? Have I done something to make you angry?]]></string>
<string id="542246"><![CDATA[...Are some people really afraid of me? Who are they?]]></string>
<string id="542247"><![CDATA[That doesn't matter. It is for the better. You can see what's going on yourself. Monsters are hatching one after another, each uglier than the one before... You poke your finger anywhere and you squash some abominable spider every time. Is the epidemic spawning them, or did they spawn the epidemic? I don't understand anything anymore.]]></string>
<string id="542248"><![CDATA[...Follow your heart's calling, father. ]]></string>
<string id="542249"><![CDATA[Yes. You're right. A lot of people are getting causes and consequences mixed up now. That's because everything has become a closed loop. They are right.]]></string>
<string id="542250"><![CDATA[What wicked person have you found for me this time?]]></string>
<string id="542251"><![CDATA[Father... Do you really want me to do something that your own patrolmen can't do? I'm no Judith…]]></string>
<string id="542252"><![CDATA[I understand that. You must be thinking that I have got myself a personal enemy—an enemy who is challenging the order that it is my present duty to enforce and maintain. I understand. You must be thinking that I want to destroy the thief and mark him with the brand of Jonah. Rest assured that it is not so.]]></string>
<string id="542253"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="542254"><![CDATA[Why would they do that? With the… corpses, I mean?]]></string>
<string id="542255"><![CDATA[They probably wanted to hide the bodies. Which can only indicate that the thieves had a hand in those people's deaths.]]></string>
<string id="542256"><![CDATA[...Do you think they deliberately infected people?]]></string>
<string id="542257"><![CDATA[Why look for it? We know where Grief's quarters are...]]></string>
<string id="542261"><![CDATA[Who could know things about him? You know... things. He won't open up unless I catch his soul with a hook.]]></string>
<string id="542262"><![CDATA[I don't know. Olgimsky surely knows something, but he will say nothing. Think. Do your own research.]]></string>
<string id="542263"><![CDATA[I'll try... I think I know who that could be…]]></string>
<string id="542264"><![CDATA[I don't think I can do it. I don't know anyone around here...]]></string>
<string id="542265"><![CDATA[No... I'll be the one who restores order here.]]></string>
<string id="542266"><![CDATA[What? What did you find out?]]></string>
<string id="542267"><![CDATA[Grief is not the mastermind. He really did prohibit murdering. The killers are being incited by a different man, known as Barley the Barber...]]></string>
<string id="542268"><![CDATA[What about me... don't you care at all?]]></string>
<string id="542269"><![CDATA[If it's true we need to inform the Bachelor immediately. He seems about to try to snatch Wolf's glory from under his nose.]]></string>
<string id="542270"><![CDATA[I'm glad you are unhurt, Clara. But I also know that you'll never come to any harm, however things might turn out... Such is your preordainment.]]></string>
<string id="542271"><![CDATA[That's true. Still, I'm terribly scared.]]></string>
<string id="542272"><![CDATA[...And what's your preordainment, father? What's Grief's? Why do you even need me for if you know things that are hidden from me?]]></string>
<string id="542273"><![CDATA[Enough... We'll discuss that later. Now to the business at hand. I need to send a messenger to Wolf at once.]]></string>
<string id="542274"><![CDATA[See this sack? I stole it from Barley's lair... Take it. It's very heavy. And wet…]]></string>
<string id="542275"><![CDATA[...Look.]]></string>
<string id="542276"><![CDATA[It's Wolf's head... The sergeant in charge of the operation. The one who first found out about the killers' secret meeting…]]></string>
<string id="542277"><![CDATA[Well? Fine parcel, eh?]]></string>
<string id="542278"><![CDATA[Barley killed him. He's the real leader of the barber gang.]]></string>
<string id="542279"><![CDATA[(...fancy that, this one isn't afraid of me either... not that it counts for much since he's just too dumb to be afraid.)]]></string>
<string id="542280"><![CDATA[I will stay here even after I leave. Will you solve my riddle?]]></string>
<string id="542281"><![CDATA[That was just me being concerned about you... Take your time and think a little, then I'll ask you again.]]></string>
<string id="542282"><![CDATA[But why don't you ask Grief yourself? You know where he lives. Bring him in and question him... why do you need me?]]></string>
<string id="542283"><![CDATA[The wily lowlife is denying everything... He feigned fear and pretended to have had nothing to do with it. He acted his part so well that he even raised the alarm himself! And yet I'm sure it's Grief who is inciting the killers, as well as buying up their victims' stolen belongings. Ask him if it's true. I am sure it is.]]></string>
<string id="542284"><![CDATA[Don't you have a way to loosen his tongue?]]></string>
<string id="542285"><![CDATA[That is not all. I suspect that Grief enjoys the Olgimskys' protection... in exchange for giving them kickbacks from his illicit trade in twyrine. Should Vlad take offence, I would prefer to face him fully armed. Ask Grief if it's true. I would like to know everything about him... before he's dealt with.]]></string>
<string id="542287"><![CDATA[I'll ask.]]></string>
<string id="542288"><![CDATA[I don't understand.]]></string>
<string id="542289"><![CDATA[I've set up a trap for Grief. Sergeant Wolf found out that the killers' ringleader had called up a meeting at a certain secret location. All that remains is to discover that location, and we'll catch Grief red-handed. The ringleader is none other than him. It cannot be anyone else.]]></string>
<string id="542290"><![CDATA[Actually, I haven't asked him yet... Because, you see, it was he who sent me to you, to intercede on his behalf!]]></string>
<string id="542291"><![CDATA[I don't know about your judgement, father—but mine has to be fair and impartial!]]></string>
<string id="542292"><![CDATA[So am I to tell Grief you're not going to go after him today?]]></string>
<string id="542293"><![CDATA[...Have you talked to it already? What did it tell you? Did you remember to ask it about... yourself?]]></string>
<string id="542294"><![CDATA[I don't believe a single word it said! But it said that I'm the plague... Which I don't believe. Don't disown me, please!]]></string>
<string id="542295"><![CDATA[How could I have asked him about my own holiness? It's a sin... I mustn't. But you do believe me, don't you?]]></string>
<string id="542296"><![CDATA[I don't even know where to begin…]]></string>
<string id="542297"><![CDATA[He deserves to die.]]></string>
<string id="542298"><![CDATA[I knew that. Who do we send to him, then? An entire squad has been massacred by the barbers...]]></string>
<string id="542299"><![CDATA[Spare yourself the trouble... father. It's all been arranged already.]]></string>
<string id="542300"><![CDATA[Begin with the Olgimskys. That is the most important sin for me, and the least for him, for it is not his fault. So did Olgimsky protect his illicit trade? Did he benefit from it?]]></string>
<string id="542301"><![CDATA[He didn't just benefit; he presided over it. Grief was his stooge.]]></string>
<string id="542302"><![CDATA[Now then, we shall skip the issue of the barber gang, since it's clear now who their true mastermind was... thanks to your courage, my brave girl.]]></string>
<string id="542303"><![CDATA[I won't be able to tell for certain until I've asked Vlad himself…]]></string>
<string id="542304"><![CDATA[Don't skip it just yet. Barley was as much of a puppet in Grief's hands as Grief himself was for Olgimsky. Everyone has their toys.]]></string>
<string id="542305"><![CDATA[...Yes, let's skip it.]]></string>
<string id="542306"><![CDATA[And I was beginning to regret my bias! It seems I shouldn't have... Well, that settles it.]]></string>
<string id="542307"><![CDATA[Aren't you interested to know what my verdict is? Whether Grief is the cause of the disaster that's struck us?]]></string>
<string id="542308"><![CDATA[Well... Is he the cause of the disaster that has struck the town? What's your verdict?]]></string>
<string id="542309"><![CDATA[So what would you say about him?]]></string>
<string id="542310"><![CDATA[Covered in blood from head to toe! He may look like one of us—but I'm convinced that he's not human. He was spawned by the abyss. An evil spirit's will is behind his actions!]]></string>
<string id="542311"><![CDATA[Leave him alone. I'll put an end to his misdeeds in due time.]]></string>
<string id="542312"><![CDATA[Because I've decided that today shall see the end of any and all killers who use scalpels, razors, knives, barber scissors, or any other manner of blades. The epidemic mowing down human lives is bad enough on its own. The streets will be safe—in daytime as well as at nighttime!]]></string>
<string id="542313"><![CDATA[The Haruspex is not one to get caught easily...]]></string>
<string id="542314"><![CDATA[I know where his lair is.]]></string>
<string id="542315"><![CDATA[Indeed? Where is it?]]></string>
<string id="542316"><![CDATA[In a factory building by the railway.]]></string>
<string id="542317"><![CDATA[There's no one there. Wolf and his squad swept all suspicious areas along the railway tracks. Including the Works.]]></string>
<string id="542318"><![CDATA[That's odd…]]></string>
<string id="542319"><![CDATA[I don't know. So this Haruspex is going to walk into an ambush as he gets home…]]></string>
<string id="542320"><![CDATA[Is Rubin really there?]]></string>
<string id="542321"><![CDATA[No. No one knows where Rubin is. The Kains dispatched about a hundred men; they've been searching for him since yesterday, turning half the town inside out, but he's still nowhere to be found. I, however, am going to search the other half... and I have the feeling I will succeed. Then the Kains will understand who they're dealing with.]]></string>
<string id="542322"><![CDATA[And is it true? About Rubin?]]></string>
<string id="542323"><![CDATA[And this Haruspex, is he—]]></string>
<string id="542324"><![CDATA[I just wanted to say that there's an ambush laid for you. Don't go home today…]]></string>
<string id="542325"><![CDATA[So that's how it is... Then I suppose you don't at all care about who's waiting for you back at home!]]></string>
<string id="542326"><![CDATA[Really? Who laid it? ]]></string>
<string id="542327"><![CDATA[I doubt it's a pleasant visitor. Whoever it is, someone knowing where I live is no good news. Or is it Young Olgimsky?]]></string>
<string id="542328"><![CDATA[Alexander Saburov, my adoptive father, detests you. For no good reason, I'd say.]]></string>
<string id="542329"><![CDATA[Thank you... what was your name again?]]></string>
<string id="542330"><![CDATA[No. Not Young Olgimsky. It's Rubin.]]></string>
<string id="542331"><![CDATA[What? Rubin? You talked to him?]]></string>
<string id="542332"><![CDATA[Yes, him. Young Olgimsky.]]></string>
<string id="542333"><![CDATA[Then he can go to hell. Chap's got nothing but money on his mind.]]></string>
<string id="542334"><![CDATA[...While you've got nothing but blood on yours, eh? You're really thick, Haruspex. Or are you too busy to stop and take a more thorough look at me?]]></string>
<string id="542335"><![CDATA[...What? Why on earth would I do that for?]]></string>
<string id="542336"><![CDATA[Because I am you. Except I'm always a step ahead of you. In everything.]]></string>
<string id="542337"><![CDATA[You see... I like you.]]></string>
<string id="542338"><![CDATA[Go away, Changeling. Got enough on my plate without you.]]></string>
<string id="542339"><![CDATA[How rude! Don't go home tonight. You'll remember my words later.]]></string>
<string id="542340"><![CDATA[That was a joke. Rubin is who's waiting for you back home. He'll have yet more to add to your plate.]]></string>

Oh no, I ain't angry at all... just tired. 'Tis all because of 'em questions. You agree to answer one, and a bit of your life's blood escapes with the answer. With the anger. Anger is our life's blood, lil' pimple...]]></string>

<string id="542347"><![CDATA[Whoa, whoa! Who are you to feel sorry for me, you lil' tot? Eh? I won't tolerate anyone's pity, I've got my own pity to spare.

Tell him I had nothin' to do with it, will you?]]></string>
<string id="542351"><![CDATA[He won't believe me. He's too angry with you. He doesn't answer to anyone, so there's a lot of rancour in him...]]></string>

<string id="542353"><![CDATA[How else do we defend ourselves against Barley the Cunt? Son of a bitch's lured all my men away from me, promisin' carnage. Those animals didn't go over to his side for the plunder; just out of sheer blood-fuckin'-lust! And who do I have left? There, go ahead, feast your eyes: my loyal faithful; that's the lot. Eh, one gets what one gets! As they say, beggars can't be choosers...]]></string>

<string id="542355"><![CDATA[Cut the braggin', thief darlin'! A gift like that spells early death, y'know. Must be the reason Saburov took you in, you poor lil' soul... So you can see through any lie, eh? How about seein' the fact that I haven't taken a single life, none at all?]]></string>

<string id="542373"><![CDATA[...That wasn't us... I know, I know the whole chant with them stiffs... but that was the Worms from the Termitary, 'n I got the blame... I know nothin'... 'tis not my scope of murder, not my style, I swear to God... poisonin' all the water, that's just... gruesome...]]></string>
<string id="542374"><![CDATA[All right. Tell me, was Olgimsky acting in collusion with you?]]></string>
<string id="542375"><![CDATA[I don't believe in magic, Grief. I can't be affected by it. Something's wrong here...]]></string>
<string id="542376"><![CDATA[It depends. Which one? There's more than one Olgimsky, you know! Heh heh... One might have, and the other one might not have. That's why you can't bring them down.

<string id="542377"><![CDATA[Grief, were you aware of the coming epidemic?]]></string>
<string id="542378"><![CDATA[I don't get it…]]></string>
<string id="542379"><![CDATA[Well, we did figure it out... Eventually. You see, black twyrine had been used as medicine during the first outbreak—and this time around the trade got really hectic 'n all... But those who'd ordered it must have known, probably as far back as summer... Heh heh...]]></string>
<string id="542380"><![CDATA[And... who had ordered it?]]></string>

<string id="542404"><![CDATA[Hell knows... Violence has always been their thing. But cutting people up with knives and razors... that's neither his style nor his level of courage.

<string id="542410"><![CDATA[We know everything—we're close by and have a nose for these things! That's what he hates us for, that bloody Filin! So this black twyrine, it's kind of sinister. Why are they so hush-hush about it? It's not like twyrine trade hasn't been around for a while. The whole town knows. And now there's this...]]></string>

<string id="542416"><![CDATA[Come closer, my daughter. Tell me—advise me—what measures must be taken to stop the epidemic? Where do we send our brave patrolmen and the Executor suicide squads?]]></string>
<string id="542417"><![CDATA[That's not for me to decide, father! My advice would be of little use here.]]></string>
<string id="542418"><![CDATA[There is nothing wrong with your saying this. I am thinking aloud, and I would like to know whether the harbinger agrees with me. For there is someone else speaking through your lips—is there not?]]></string>
<string id="542419"><![CDATA[Yes. There is.]]></string>
<string id="542420"><![CDATA[That is my job to do. Do not worry about that. To be the ruler during a plague is a cursed part to play and a grievous burden: a man doomed to nothing but error.

<string id="542423"><![CDATA[Five years ago, the Sand Plague broke out in the poor districts where, due to our negligence, the social and sanitary conditions had become truly appalling. If, like the plague, it is spread by blood-sucking fleas and their host animals, perhaps a culling of bulls and other domestic animals would be the best solution?]]></string>
<string id="542424"><![CDATA[Why cull bulls? Bulls don't get fleas; they aren't a threat.]]></string>
<string id="542425"><![CDATA[I will tell you what I'm going to do. Don't say a word to anyone about the plague! I refuse to allow a panic, and so I will ban all expressions of mourning.

<string id="542443"><![CDATA[No, I haven't. I was terribly frightened... And I don't think it spoke either... but when I listened closer I realized that the strange humming in my ears was a voice muttering from somewhere... as if from under the ground, in fact. I couldn't make out the words, but somehow I understood...]]></string>

<string id="542477"><![CDATA[This Aglaya Lilich has installed some kind of a tyranny in the town. She failed to carry out the task she was entrusted with. She gave shelter to both of the demons. She has appropriated the fruit of someone else's labour and travestied someone else's accomplishments. As if this is not enough, she acts as if she were a conqueror standing atop the ruins of the enemy town! This has to be stopped.

You should approach her directly and demand an answer—just like she demanded an answer from you. Try it, Clara, don't be afraid... Who knows what may come of this?

<string id="542518"><![CDATA[Don't act surprised!]]></string>
<string id="542519"><![CDATA[Impossible! I warned them not to kill anyone but Earthkin, the butchers and the Worms enslaved by the wicked Haruspex!]]></string>
<string id="542520"><![CDATA[They did mean to, Maria... but I beat them to the punch.]]></string>
<string id="542521"><![CDATA[Yes, Maria, I'm afraid... How is a feeble child like me to take on a demon? For I know he is a demon. Obsession equals possession.]]></string>
<string id="542522"><![CDATA[That cannot be... Fear is not your kind of emotion; or else what good of a Mistress are you? In any case, I will repay you; there will be rewards. Unless perhaps you would prefer doing me the occasional small favour to strengthen our soon-to-be... bond.]]></string>
<string id="542523"><![CDATA[Maria, oh Maria... Nothing will bond me to you, nothing ever.]]></string>
<string id="542524"><![CDATA[No... I just wanted to tell you that—I'm going. I'm going to go and do your bidding, you see? Which makes you the one who ought to be afraid.]]></string>

<string id="542526"><![CDATA[*** Mistake! A bad mistake! For this kind of a creature, a name would mean much more than simple definition... Saying her name would have granted me the power to control her.]]></string>
<string id="542527"><![CDATA[I'm not yet sure I'll want to accept that title.]]></string>
<string id="542528"><![CDATA[Don't say that... father! And forgive me like I've forgiven you.]]></string>
<string id="542529"><![CDATA[A Mistress is not a title. Once you have crossed a certain line, you become the person everything hinges upon. How you will use this gift is a different matter. But you are no longer in a position to refuse it. So what disposition are you going to make of our town?]]></string>
<string id="542530"><![CDATA[Do you have any parting advice to give me?]]></string>
<string id="542531"><![CDATA[I don't want to use that gift. I'm just leaving.]]></string>
<string id="542532"><![CDATA[You are truly a saint... Or could my reason be so clouded with grief that I fail to hear the sarcasm in your voice? No, I wouldn't want to think so. Do you really want to hear a few behests from me?]]></string>
<string id="542533"><![CDATA[Yes. I'll do what you weren't able to do, father. After all, the adverse fortunes that marred your brief tenure as a ruler were quite extraordinary…]]></string>
<string id="542534"><![CDATA[...I was joking, of course. You'd probably be no better as an advisor than you were as a ruler.]]></string>
<string id="542535"><![CDATA[Then I will be concise. First: find someone among the Kains or the Olgimskys on whom you could rely as on yourself. Let them preside over the Bull Project, let them send reports to the Сapital! Metropolitan bureaucrats are the greatest menace. They doze off when the freight trains arrive on schedule—but wake up the moment something goes wrong.]]></string>
<string id="542536"><![CDATA[Why is that a threat for us?]]></string>
<string id="542537"><![CDATA[Ha ha! So everything's been all right until now? I'm sure the bureaucrats still don't know a thing…]]></string>
<string id="542538"><![CDATA[They will not let us build our life the way it was intended. The brittle magic of our community will be trampled underfoot. Our erstwhile blissful existence will be irrevocably gone. Everything will be completely different. New people will arrive, and the deadening power of the state will lay down its own Law here! Do not let that happen... as we didn't let it happen before.]]></string>
<string id="542539"><![CDATA[Will I be able to do it?]]></string>
<string id="542540"><![CDATA[You'll do fine! You'll devote yourself to other things; you'll be spinning your yarn... While your chosen regent must be cunning. He must learn to mislead them... to mask our distinctiveness... he must not let them redevelop the North-East Line any further east than the Gorkhon estuary... He must be cautious!]]></string>
<string id="542541"><![CDATA[I understand, father. You're tired. You need some rest now.]]></string>
<string id="542542"><![CDATA[I know what to do. Those who favour hard logic and direct action are bound to be misguided. But I can work miracles. And my hands are untied.]]></string>

<string id="542545"><![CDATA[Look at me, Clara! Why did I chance to cross your path? What do you think? Could it be so that I could sing an ode to fear and give you a vivid example of what that leads to?]]></string>
<string id="542546"><![CDATA[Are bureaucrats that easy to mislead?]]></string>
<string id="542547"><![CDATA[Of course, damn it! We've always been misleading them! Our great advantage is that they don't take us seriously. As far as they're concerned, we are a factory and a railway junction. Beyond that, they know nothing—see, even the Inquisitor hasn't learned everything.]]></string>
<string id="542548"><![CDATA[Just like that? Really?]]></string>
<string id="542549"><![CDATA[That one's a hopeless fool.]]></string>
<string id="542550"><![CDATA[Of course! Should an inspector arrive, take them to the Town Hall at once. Say that the Abattoir is out of operation, and quarantine the Termitary—whatever is going on inside it. If they want to take a stroll around the town, take them to the Chine. And the Polyhedron? Tell him it's a temporary obelisk. A fairground attraction!]]></string>
<string id="542551"><![CDATA[I don't know how to talk to bureaucrats…]]></string>
<string id="542552"><![CDATA[That's not misleading at all. It's precisely that.]]></string>
<string id="542553"><![CDATA[Why are you talking like that all of a sudden? What's the matter with you? Or is someone hiding behind that curtain over there?]]></string>
<string id="542554"><![CDATA[Would you say that's why you've ended up among the wicked?]]></string>
<string id="542555"><![CDATA[Of course it is. You've understood everything already... What does the Caravan have to do with it? A children's bogeyman, one of those silly stories they tell each other after dark... Maybe it never existed. Maybe I never was with the Caravan... Take a look at me; how could I possibly have been a singer?]]></string>
<string id="542556"><![CDATA[So you're a liar too…]]></string>
<string id="542557"><![CDATA[I am an embodiment of fear. I live in a world that's made of fear entirely. I may not have become a singer, but I've become the voice of Fear. And fear has an unpleasant voice... shrill, whiny, capricious, utterly unmusical…]]></string>
<string id="542558"><![CDATA[So, if you're like that, why did our paths cross?]]></string>
<string id="542559"><![CDATA[Probably to prevent you from becoming like me. A voice—an entrancing voice, sweet as a dream and beckoning, is what you and I have in common. Do you understand? That's where we intersect! Not the Caravan, not at all! Forget the Caravan!]]></string>
<string id="542560"><![CDATA[I have already…]]></string>
<string id="542561"><![CDATA[You, on the other hand, won't stop thinking about it! You're hiding something, Anna! You're still hiding something. What is this Caravan? How did it get here?]]></string>
<string id="542562"><![CDATA[Ask the Powers That Be. You've paid them a visit already, haven't you? They'll tell you... what the plague is for and what the Caravan is for. It's their games!]]></string>
<string id="542563"><![CDATA[Fair enough, fair enough... Which means it's not all that important in the end.]]></string>
<string id="542564"><![CDATA[So... is it going to hurt a lot? When is my turn?]]></string>
<string id="542565"><![CDATA[Would you like to be the first or the last?]]></string>
<string id="542566"><![CDATA[I don't know. But I think not. A brief moment of pain, and then you'll attain the eternal life, dissolving in a multitude of hearts.]]></string>
<string id="542567"><![CDATA[…Last. Or not—I suppose it's better to get it over with at once! No, wait... I'll tell you later, all right? Better still, just sneak in unnoticed sometime. Will you? Maybe it's better if we do it that way?]]></string>
<string id="542568"><![CDATA[Maybe. I'll come after you forget about this.]]></string>

<string id="542573"><![CDATA[That's true. We have no one to fear except ourselves.]]></string>
<string id="542574"><![CDATA[...Have you really changed so much? Then for this alone, these twelve days have been worth living.]]></string>
<string id="542575"><![CDATA[Back then, y'see, you figured out the sheer scale of my nastiness, just how much of a villain I was, didntcha? And then you just froze in place—'n my heart sank 'n I thought, so much for ever being forgiven. That's a lil' tot that's gonna condemn me. But you didn't—you forgave me; and I was never the same again. I'd be happy to give my life for you now! I swear to God 'n my own accord!]]></string>
<string id="542576"><![CDATA[Happy? Honestly?]]></string>
<string id="542577"><![CDATA[Good. Your atonement will be your salvation. Wait for me to come for you.]]></string>
<string id="542578"><![CDATA[You won't find a more faithful servant from now on, no ma'am! For I have repented. All my cutthroats would die for you too! What is your command, Mistress? My life for you! Me—becomin' like Simon—could I even have imagined...? But even the old man could never become someone like you.]]></string>
<string id="542579"><![CDATA[Please! Stop talking like that!]]></string>
<string id="542580"><![CDATA[Eh... Who are we when you come to think about it? What are we? A bunch of walking corpses, we are, condemned to death the moment we're born; a bunch of dolls in the hands of the powers that be. Eh? And you two, you're the real humans. But he, Simon, was a proud human, y'see? 'Twas for our sake that he'd made himself into what he was... And you, holy dove; you have surpassed him—for our sake as well.]]></string>
<string id="542581"><![CDATA[Have I really? We don't know that yet.]]></string>
<string id="542582"><![CDATA[Don't say things like that! It's the kind of talk that leads one astray.]]></string>

<string id="542584"><![CDATA[You're making fun of me, right? That's not good. You shouldn't…]]></string>
<string id="542585"><![CDATA[Do you have any... parting words for me? You're an observer of people—so what do your calculations indicate?]]></string>
<string id="542586"><![CDATA[Wait. Give yourself a moment's pause. Are you sure you want to know what my research has yielded? You see.. whether or not you take my calculations seriously, the moment you learn the results you will have no choice but to act them out. This is merely my way of seeing the matter, though.... So, what do you say? Would you like to set off this trip-wire of mine?]]></string>
<string id="542587"><![CDATA[I do. It won't do me any harm. In my humble opinion.]]></string>
<string id="542588"><![CDATA[...Actually, you know what? No. I don't want to. You're right.]]></string>
<string id="542589"><![CDATA[You remain an indefinite value. As such, you have walked the road that lies behind you. Your refusal to be categorised was your strongest weapon. However, this advantage will be stripped from you as soon as you permutate into a constant. And, frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if that happens before the day is over. What kind of a value you will become? That's the only actual choice you have.]]></string>
<string id="542590"><![CDATA[I'm not Constance. I'm Clara.]]></string>
<string id="542591"><![CDATA[This is of no importance. Don't try to translate your perplexity into a language that is legible to us. Cease this wordplay of yours. Didn't you see everyone disappear? You won't see anything but raw vectors now, lines along which your effort may be applied... Well, really... ]]></string>
<string id="542592"><![CDATA[Why did our paths cross, Yulia? Why are you one of the criminals and the wicked?]]></string>
<string id="542593"><![CDATA[I don't qualify as wicked, but you can call me criminal... in a way. Just don't conflate the two.  You see, I am of the opinion that it was your duty to end us. Didn't I just tell you, there are no people anymore? Symbols is all that we have left. We all represent opportunities that you have missed... the nine ways to get swallowed by the deathly quagmire.]]></string>
<string id="542594"><![CDATA[I don't like you! I find you even worse than Grief!]]></string>
<string id="542595"><![CDATA[What?]]></string>
<string id="542596"><![CDATA[You should be grateful to me for having replaced you. Otherwise it would have been you—and not me—to rot in this desolate place I am consigned to. You would have been left hanging by your strings...]]></string>
<string id="542597"><![CDATA[I'd have been glad to trade places with you. But I wasn't given the choice!]]></string>
<string id="542598"><![CDATA[You wanted to rule over people's fates too... I understand.]]></string>
<string id="542599"><![CDATA[Oh, but you were! Let me remind you how intrinsically evil people are. The very nature of you—is evil. You were given exactly as much choice as was necessary for you to affirm your malevolent selfhood. It is not too late yet. Let go of yourself and you will fall even lower than I have fallen... lower than any of us, the nine sinners, from which you will pick the righteous seven.]]></string>
<string id="542600"><![CDATA[Enough. There's no evil in this world... and no need to be afraid anymore.]]></string>

<string id="542607"><![CDATA[I don't know, Lara. Time will tell. Isn't it the same to you?]]></string>
<string id="542608"><![CDATA[Of course, of course... Even one would be quite enough. It's something to rejoice in.]]></string>
<string id="542609"><![CDATA[Yes, to rejoice in.]]></string>
<string id="542610"><![CDATA[Oh... that's a lot. Even in a lifetime of relentless activity, I could never have saved or... or created that many people.]]></string>

<string id="542616"><![CDATA[Are you raving?]]></string>
<string id="542617"><![CDATA[No one is more similar than you and Simon. Even we, the Bound, are mere playthings, while you are Humans. With a capital H. Such as I could never have given birth to even if I had got married.]]></string>

<string id="542619"><![CDATA[Sort of... Not really, but I'd often think about it at night. No point in hiding my sins anymore. But that was all a pipe dream. Go ahead, do what you must.

<string id="542624"><![CDATA[I am a monster, Mistress. A chimera. You were right when you called such humanlike, double-natured beings demons. It is good that you'll destroy me with your magic hands. The evil I stand for will go down with me. It's unnatural to be double-natured.]]></string>
<string id="542625"><![CDATA[…Your grandfather was a bull, wasn't he? ]]></string>
<string id="542626"><![CDATA[True. You can see yourself that my bloodline must be terminated. Evil channels through me, as it does through your counterparts. Someone dark had been stirring behind their backs before you came along and took charge. Now that dark soul is no longer with them, and you ought to drive them out. Don't let them loose.]]></string>

<string id="542635"><![CDATA[Heed my final advice, dear daughter... Be smart. Don't repeat my mistakes! You will not be alone here. Maria is ascending to the fullness of her powers—right now, at the same time as you—whilst Capella, the tardy one, will take a few more years to awaken. Do you understand what this means?]]></string>
<string id="542636"><![CDATA[No, not quite... What?]]></string>
<string id="542637"><![CDATA[Maria will not awaken. And Capella... I don't think she will either.]]></string>
<string id="542638"><![CDATA[A period of your antagonism with Maria is beginning. Along what lines will it be? Which of you will be the good one, and which one wicked? Will it be up to the Kains once again to determine the meaning of good and evil? How are you to take the good path if Maria doesn't choose the evil one...?]]></string>
<string id="542639"><![CDATA[Why divide everything into good and evil right away? Could that have been your mistake? Our mistake…]]></string>
<string id="542640"><![CDATA[That was what I thought—when I chose my own dark path... I thought the conflict was not between good and evil, that neither good nor evil existed... That wasn't true! For it is in the nature of humans to translate even a dichotomy of red and green into the language of good battling evil. We are doomed to make choices...]]></string>
<string id="542641"><![CDATA[But did you really choose evil?]]></string>
<string id="542642"><![CDATA[No, mother... That's not what the ongoing battle is about. Trust me, good and evil do not and will not exist today... Even if the town is laid waste to!]]></string>
<string id="542643"><![CDATA[I now think I did... Nina could control it at the time... and I couldn't. Nor was Nina wearing the black tiara... But don't put your trust in what is more alluring, more attractive! That is usually where evil lies!]]></string>

<string id="542676"><![CDATA[Let's get straight to the point. How many years will one person last us?]]></string>
<string id="542677"><![CDATA[But you can be in both places at once, can't you? Such is your nature. You'll stay here with us forever, and at the same time, you'll go to war... alongside Block and his army. Your nature could easily allow there to be two of you.]]></string>

<string id="542690"><![CDATA[I don't think once will be enough. And you'll have to do it in public, to avoid rumours and speculations. At any rate, I'll make the extracts and see what happens. We'll try this and that.]]></string>

<string id="542692"><![CDATA[All right, Stakh. I've understood your plan. You're going to have to be the last in that chain.]]></string>
<string id="542693"><![CDATA[Your role in this is a mechanical one. Ask the masked Executors. They're already excitedly sharing details with each other.]]></string>
<string id="542694"><![CDATA[What's that supposed to mean? My "role"? What role?]]></string>
<string id="542695"><![CDATA[I'd like to avoid that. Miracles and mechanics don't mix very well, do they?]]></string>
<string id="542696"><![CDATA[I don't know. That's up to you.]]></string>
<string id="542697"><![CDATA[Yes, it's up to me... And that points my thoughts in a certain direction…]]></string>
<string id="542698"><![CDATA[...So we've gone full circle?]]></string>
<string id="542700"><![CDATA[So that was the easiest option?]]></string>
<string id="542701"><![CDATA[Yes, it was perhaps... the simplest solution. And the most emotional one, behind its veneer of calculation. Three deceptions, one after another... gradual disillusionment, bitterness, a desire to retaliate against the oppressors... predictable obstinacry and a contrarian decision.]]></string>
<string id="542702"><![CDATA[Does he at least have a chance to defeat you?]]></string>
<string id="542703"><![CDATA[Depends on what he's understood, doesn't it? Surely you two have had a conversation aready. How profoundly has he been enlightened, this sophisticated gentleman?]]></string>

<string id="542708"><![CDATA[Ah... I see. He should better bring somebody else to the Cathedral then. As I've already said: his trajectory is so designed as to make it difficult for him to abandon his arrangement. Except by a lapse of judgement—but we're not concerned with that.]]></string>
<string id="542709"><![CDATA[Indeed? And why the hell are you planning beforehand which decision will be free and which won't be? There's no escaping from this loop! So long as you're here, this will last forever.]]></string>

<string id="542717"><![CDATA[Go to hell…]]></string>
<string id="542718"><![CDATA[So it was a kind of loop?]]></string>
<string id="542719"><![CDATA[Yes. The purest version of one, it seems. Two diverging pairs of decisions. Both pre-determined, but the dilemma is a harsh one indeed. That made the freedom all the more salient. And then, you see, there were also feelings involved... Love.]]></string>

<string id="542722"><![CDATA[He doesn't seem to have understood anything at all. Perhaps he doesn't even care. He thinks himself a hero.]]></string>
<string id="542723"><![CDATA[Ah... I see. Then it would be better if he waived the choice altogether. That would at least be unexpected. Seems daft, doesn't it? But it's not that simple... The Haruspex is a man of action, and—]]></string>

<string id="542741"><![CDATA[Now then, what have you understood, sweetie?]]></string>
<string id="542742"><![CDATA[It's all been clear to me for quite a while. I know there's no one here except me and you, and that you left this place a long time ago. That which is talking to me is your pitiful residue.]]></string>
<string id="542743"><![CDATA[Whoa. Since then have we been on such familiar terms?]]></string>
<string id="542744"><![CDATA[We were talking to the Changeling. Ignore that. We're assuming you couldn't possibly have asked such a question.]]></string>

<string id="542754"><![CDATA[...Shall we tell you? Brace yourself! We're going to actually tell you!]]></string>
<string id="542755"><![CDATA[Yes, tell me.]]></string>
<string id="542756"><![CDATA[Stop! Don't. Anything but that.]]></string>
<string id="542757"><![CDATA[Go ahead and tell me you didn't plan anything at all for me. Scumbags…]]></string>
<string id="542758"><![CDATA[Well... initially, we were going to rest content with just the destruction, but then we quickly slapped together a different ending... which had this sacrificial miracle in it. On the whole, though, we didn't really plan anything, to be honest. There just wasn't enough time to think it through.]]></string>
<string id="542759"><![CDATA[...You guessed?]]></string>
<string id="542760"><![CDATA[I guessed.]]></string>

<string id="542763"><![CDATA[So is the plague an evil or a blessing?]]></string>
<string id="542764"><![CDATA[Oh, that's up to you to decide.]]></string>
<string id="542765"><![CDATA[Or was I that blessed divine messenger precisely when I was spreading the plague with my hands? Was I doing His will?]]></string>
<string id="542766"><![CDATA[Whose will? That's the principal question. I'm still losing the thread and don't know who I'm talking to.]]></string>
<string id="542767"><![CDATA[Can a miracle be performed under such conditions?]]></string>
<string id="542768"><![CDATA[And why are you still here? Have you been left behind or something?]]></string>

<string id="542770"><![CDATA[Scared? Why are you scared, little girl? What did you say your name was?]]></string>
<string id="542771"><![CDATA[I've come to play with you a little before I go…]]></string>
<string id="542772"><![CDATA[Oh... Thrush.]]></string>
<string id="542773"><![CDATA[Is it derived from "thrust", as in into the ground, or "crush", as in in the process?]]></string>
<string id="542774"><![CDATA[Hey! Don't say that… it's scary!They took the coffin this morning and drove away with it! It's not coming back! Ever! No one is going to thrust anything anywhere!]]></string>

<string id="542776"><![CDATA[Uh-huh... So that I don't catch the disease.]]></string>
<string id="542777"><![CDATA[So you're afraid of a play-disease? How could you possibly catch it?]]></string>
<string id="542778"><![CDATA[Anything can happen... One doesn't trifle with such things, you know. Sometimes it's all fun and games till it happens for real. That's what I keep telling Measly but he wouldn't listen...]]></string>
<string id="542779"><![CDATA[Ah, so we're being sensitive now... If you're afraid of a coffin, why play a game like this? Well, whatever; I don't suppose there's a point in talking to you…]]></string>

<string id="542782"><![CDATA[I don't know... Not old. And you may be a great big dummy but we're still the same height!]]></string>
<string id="542783"><![CDATA[It's because I'm hunkering. That's why we're the same height. See?]]></string>
<string id="542784"><![CDATA[Want to know who's the great big dummy here? Look in the mirror.]]></string>
<string id="542785"><![CDATA[So you're back from a funeral... By the way, you can tell me who it is you've lost.]]></string>

<string id="542789"><![CDATA[How old are you, child?]]></string>
<string id="542790"><![CDATA[Well, you know... just to see if you say anything interesting. But now I see you're just playing around in here.]]></string>
<string id="542791"><![CDATA[No, little boy... I'm not Clara.]]></string>
<string id="542792"><![CDATA[A high flying bird you've become.

The Executors are watching you, barely able to hide a smile... and I don't like their smirks one bit. Soon enough you are going to see that they were not smiling because they were happy for you.

Beware, if you may, we were both trapped. Each one of us has suffered a tailor-made deception. They say you are not like me, and this is not something I would argue with. Moreover, I've just found out something utterly ridiculous about myself. Hopefully, your fate will not be a reiteration of my own.

Be very careful, anyway. Self-assurance is your worst enemy. I've learned of at least one way to achieve victory. Perhaps it may work well enough for you.

Come see me if you will. Give me the benefit of doubt, so to speak.

<string id="542799"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>

<string id="542801"><![CDATA[What would be the point? You're not part of my plans.]]></string>
<string id="542802"><![CDATA[Just wanted to have a final talk with you... Before the Council begins. To extend a hand, if you like.]]></string>
<string id="542803"><![CDATA[Please explain. You've found room for everyone in your plans, but not me?]]></string>
<string id="542804"><![CDATA[Something like that. Both the Bachelor and the Haruspex are of this world, and you aren't. You're a foreign body, a demon pretending to be human. They're people of the same flesh and blood as myself; you're a thing that comes in the dark. They aren't demons. You are.]]></string>
<string id="542805"><![CDATA[So you've placed your bets on these two? Perhaps both at once?]]></string>

<string id="542812"><![CDATA[I've already told you. Step aside. Get out of this world. That's the best solution for you.]]></string>
<string id="542813"><![CDATA[Why do you detest me so much?]]></string>
<string id="542814"><![CDATA[You've joined forces with the Commander. I can predict the consequences of your alliance. You being a fanatic and visionary—moreover, in the guise of a prophetess possessed by the Holy Spirit—he'll certainly acquiesce to you and will end up completely under your control.]]></string>
<string id="542815"><![CDATA[Are you saying this on purpose to make me strengthen that alliance just to spite you?]]></string>
<string id="542816"><![CDATA[The Commander is the lowliest of you all. Not just a puppet but a double puppet. Or a triple one. That's why I can relate to him so well.]]></string>
<string id="542817"><![CDATA[No. And I'd generally advise you against calculations like these. I'll always be a step ahead of you there.]]></string>
<string id="542818"><![CDATA[Could be, could be... All right, goodbye. See you at the Council.]]></string>
<string id="542819"><![CDATA[Sorry to say we probably aren't going to reconcile our differences.]]></string>

<string id="542827"><![CDATA[Yes, certainly. Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="542828"><![CDATA[Not nine but seven, to be exact. Nine were invited, seven were chosen. Nine sinners, seven transformed.]]></string>

<string id="542850"><![CDATA[Yes, I was going to ask a few questions. All right, I'll try to save everyone. It seems I'm destined for this… being the saviour of assorted nobodies.]]></string>

<string id="542885"><![CDATA[I don't get it either. She just does.]]></string>
<string id="542886"><![CDATA[Are you even capable of love?]]></string>
<string id="542887"><![CDATA[Go home, kids. There's nothing for you to do here anymore. The game is over.]]></string>
<string id="542888"><![CDATA[Yes, we are. And you?]]></string>
<string id="542889"><![CDATA[Of course.]]></string>
<string id="542890"><![CDATA[No. I'm not.]]></string>
<string id="542891"><![CDATA[I don't know.]]></string>
<string id="542892"><![CDATA[So you're leaving the decision to me?]]></string>
<string id="542893"><![CDATA[Yes. I am. Why would I have brought you here otherwise?]]></string>
<string id="542894"><![CDATA[But what's the point? Do tell me. And be careful! A lot will depend on your answer.]]></string>
<string id="542895"><![CDATA[The point is that in this case, the winner will be—]]></string>
<string id="542896"><![CDATA[…Love, right?]]></string>
<string id="542897"><![CDATA[...No. Mere humanity. Any kind of it—even malicious, and yet still a living one. We win and you lose here, you see?]]></string>
<string id="542899"><![CDATA[You're wrong. Go, there's your Eva, crying by the railing. You'll be the only one who sees her.]]></string>
<string id="542900"><![CDATA[A good answer. Thank you.]]></string>
<string id="542901"><![CDATA[You know, I really couldn't care less. As far as I'm concerned, you understand less about sacrificial victims than the Bachelor does about mirror towers.]]></string>
<string id="542902"><![CDATA[You've disappointed me, Haruspex. I didn't expect such pettiness from you.]]></string>
<string id="542903"><![CDATA[All right. Let's not argue in here. Will you let me decide?]]></string>
<string id="542904"><![CDATA[I will. I like your decision.]]></string>
<string id="542905"><![CDATA[You know, I've seen all of this already! So what's the difference? Nothing's changed!]]></string>
<string id="542906"><![CDATA[If you really think so, step aside. Let me make the decision. If you don't understand anything, then mine and the Bachelor's decisions are inherently better than yours. And mine is, of course, better than the Bachelor's.]]></string>
<string id="542907"><![CDATA[Why so?]]></string>
<string id="542908"><![CDATA[There's more feeling in it.]]></string>
<string id="542909"><![CDATA[No. Not more. Just as much, or as little.]]></string>
<string id="542910"><![CDATA[It's because your confidants are children. I wish mine were like that...]]></string>
<string id="542911"><![CDATA[Yes. And so, hopefully, will I.]]></string>
<string id="542912"><![CDATA[Farewell, my general. This is truly the end. Our time is up.]]></string>
<string id="542913"><![CDATA[Don't worry, my general. I know how much you value clarity.]]></string>
<string id="542914"><![CDATA[What if I said no?]]></string>
<string id="542915"><![CDATA[I've made up my own mind. If your answer is no, I'll find a way to reconcile myself with that. Perhaps after a while I'll realize what I don't realize now.]]></string>
<string id="542916"><![CDATA[Now you've surprised me too. Imagine that! I was almost thinking—]]></string>
<string id="542917"><![CDATA[No. I know all that already.]]></string>
<string id="542918"><![CDATA[So be it then.]]></string>
<string id="542919"><![CDATA[And you're aware of how it's going to be implemented?]]></string>
<string id="542920"><![CDATA[I don't need to be. Because I trust you.]]></string>
<string id="542921"><![CDATA[So shall it be then.]]></string>
<string id="542922"><![CDATA[Make your own choice, Commander. You are free.]]></string>
<string id="542923"><![CDATA[You're intending to go back to the frontline, aren't you?]]></string>
<string id="542924"><![CDATA[I've trusted you... and I'm not going back on that trust.]]></string>
<string id="542925"><![CDATA[Nothing.]]></string>
<string id="542926"><![CDATA[Would you like to talk to the Haruspex?]]></string>
<string id="542927"><![CDATA[No. I don't. I'll do as you say, and I need no one else's advice. Do you definitely believe that this is what must be done?]]></string>
<string id="542928"><![CDATA[What are you talking about?]]></string>
<string id="542929"><![CDATA[Will you leave this place with me?]]></string>
<string id="542930"><![CDATA[Of course! Where am I to be now if not on the battlefield.]]></string>
<string id="542931"><![CDATA[No, my general. I will have to remain here forever. Otherwise, how am I to transform my Bound?]]></string>
<string id="542932"><![CDATA[Exactly. I'm glad you feel the same way as I do. You will help me take power in the country. My army will be at your disposal. Make us a tool in His spear-hand.]]></string>
<string id="542933"><![CDATA[I'm not asking you to think it over—such decisions are better left to the heart. Instead of nursing a single town for the remainder of your days, you could turn the entire country to the true faith. Our entire star-crossed, long-suffering land.]]></string>
<string id="542934"><![CDATA[No, no... I'm not up to a task like this! How could I ever be?]]></string>
<string id="542935"><![CDATA[Who is up to it if not you? Who will do away with the unjust rulers? Who will stop the war? Who will put an end to the suffering of the poor? The moment is right. It is at times like these, ridden with strife and turmoil, with no end to adversity in sight, that true power breaks free. My regiments can turn the tide. And I will not allow a lawless tyranny!]]></string>
<string id="542936"><![CDATA[O, how mistaken you are!]]></string>
<string id="542937"><![CDATA[True... You must be right...]]></string>
<string id="542938"><![CDATA[Your virtue will vouch for this!]]></string>
<string id="542939"><![CDATA[Don't tempt me, my general. This path is not for me.]]></string>
<string id="542940"><![CDATA[How can you not understand... You're living a dream. All of this is a mere haze. You came out of thin air and you'll pass into nothingness.]]></string>
<string id="542941"><![CDATA[Yes... You have a firm hand.]]></string>
<string id="542942"><![CDATA[Is that what you think?]]></string>
<string id="542943"><![CDATA[I feel I must do what must be done here. If it is necessary that we are rejoined, we will be when the time is ripe.]]></string>
<string id="542944"><![CDATA[To me, you look like a body with its soul taken out. A thing that looks and acts human—but isn't!]]></string>
<string id="542945"><![CDATA[And in the meantime, I've realized what my mission is…]]></string>
<string id="542946"><![CDATA[Yes, do tell me, please, it's very interesting. How did you wriggle out of that trap?]]></string>
<string id="542947"><![CDATA[I didn't. I'm a hero. Better to be a trapped hero than a free cripple, isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="542948"><![CDATA[The town will suffer…]]></string>
<string id="542949"><![CDATA[The town is an instrument. It was made for humans, not the other way round.]]></string>
<string id="542950"><![CDATA[But you're not human!]]></string>
<string id="542951"><![CDATA[You're forgetting about freedom. All that's happening here is happening for your freedom's sake. Do you understand?]]></string>
<string id="542952"><![CDATA[I must admit I'm a bit confused—but it was for the better. It allowed me to escape the iron grip of my preordainment. I'm content with being able to choose with my heart.]]></string>
<string id="542953"><![CDATA[The creators of this dilemma had limited your choice to two options…]]></string>
<string id="542954"><![CDATA[I'm content with as much regardless. If you give me a chance to choose, you can be sure I'll choose the most humane solution. The most human one.]]></string>
<string id="542955"><![CDATA[Oh really? The Bachelor at least figured out he was a puppet.]]></string>
<string id="542956"><![CDATA[I'm not a toy, Changeling. I am Artemy Burakh, a Haruspex who knows the lines, a Warden who has fulfilled his mission and reconciled his father's spirit with the Earth, and has made the correct choice. That's who I am. Do you understand?]]></string>
<string id="542957"><![CDATA[Are you at least aware that you're a mere toy?]]></string>
<string id="542958"><![CDATA[And I'm not a puppet. Must be because I never figured it out... What else do you plan on surprising me with?]]></string>
<string id="542959"><![CDATA[Do you really not care?]]></string>
<string id="542960"><![CDATA[So you're a believer in salvation through ignorance?]]></string>
<string id="542961"><![CDATA[No. I don't. But you do seem to have got it mixed up. You think, don't you, that what happened here was all on your account? Yes, you're confused... But then allow me to take charge. Tell the Commander. He listens to you with rapt attention. He wouldn't even bother listening to me.]]></string>
<string id="542962"><![CDATA[You can be persuasive... Perhaps you are right after all…]]></string>
<string id="542963"><![CDATA[No, Haruspex. That's not going to happen.]]></string>
<string id="542964"><![CDATA[Who, you? But you are nothing!]]></string>
<string id="542965"><![CDATA[What makes you think so? I'm as human as they come, and no amount of your insults will change that.]]></string>
<string id="542966"><![CDATA[Wait... I think I'm beginning to understand you... And now... yes, now I see that you're closer to victory than me…]]></string>
<string id="542967"><![CDATA[You're a demon!]]></string>
<string id="542968"><![CDATA[Why?]]></string>
<string id="542969"><![CDATA[Because your nature is different. You're a golem without a soul—or more exactly, with a borrowed soul!]]></string>
<string id="542970"><![CDATA[That's where you're wrong. If nothing else, I'm definitely not lacking in the immortal soul department. Rather, it's my soul that some people wouldn't stop trying to borrow, as they seek to control me. Try telling them to their faces about their demonic nature...]]></string>
<string id="542971"><![CDATA[You're wise! So you do know how to win? Aglaya was right…]]></string>
<string id="542972"><![CDATA[That last part sounded oddly covetous.]]></string>
<string id="542973"><![CDATA[Could be... I'm not the one without sin here. That would be you.]]></string>
<string id="542974"><![CDATA[That's no laughing matter. You wouldn't understand anyway... ]]></string>
<string id="542975"><![CDATA[I'm more than a plaything, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="542976"><![CDATA[Of course not... For the town's sake.]]></string>
<string id="542977"><![CDATA[There are no bachelors and no towns here, blind man! There's just you and I. And you are my past. Meaning that, technically, there's just me and I.]]></string>
<string id="542978"><![CDATA[Then the I that's me is the better one.]]></string>
<string id="542979"><![CDATA[No way, Bachelor.]]></string>
<string id="542980"><![CDATA[As if anything could be apparent to you! You're a bodily frame devoid of soul and will; you're not capable of understanding a thing at this point.]]></string>
<string id="542981"><![CDATA[Self-denial is the meaning here, silly. Deny yourself and you win. Yes, that's how it is! That's the essence of my discovery.]]></string>
<string id="542982"><![CDATA[How banal! Even bordering on trite, don't you think?]]></string>
<string id="542983"><![CDATA[Don't rush to conclusions. I'm on the verge of making my final discovery. In a nutshell, I feel I've been imbued with more meaning than is apparent to me.]]></string>
<string id="542984"><![CDATA[There are no bachelors and no towns here, blind man! There's just you and I. And you are my future that I don't even want to happen. It's dull.]]></string>
<string id="542985"><![CDATA[Too convoluted, Bachelor. You're that learned fool from vulgar comedies. Try repeating all of that in Latin; you might bring down the house. Goodbye.]]></string>
<string id="542986"><![CDATA[It was for you. You think that because your nature is evil. It's only fitting that you should reject it.]]></string>
<string id="542987"><![CDATA[You don't say!]]></string>
<string id="542988"><![CDATA[I've always sensed it in you. At first I thought you were a demon, because you weren't like them, with a power of a different kind growling inside you—now I see why it seemed that way!]]></string>
<string id="542989"><![CDATA[Isn't that also the essence of your supposed miracle? Assuming, of course, that Rubin described it to me accurately.]]></string>
<string id="542990"><![CDATA[I can make any miracle happen, Bachelor. That is my essence.]]></string>
<string id="542991"><![CDATA[No, Bachelor. It's not that. Goodbye.]]></string>
<string id="542992"><![CDATA[You're possessed with pride.]]></string>
<string id="542993"><![CDATA[Not at all. Actually I realize that you're closer to victory than me. See, I've had the humility to admit the greatness of your feat. After all, unlike me, you had no predisposition for it…]]></string>
<string id="542994"><![CDATA[Not at all. I'm merely aware of my responsibility and have no intention of disowning my power. There's a greater pride in humility—haven't you ever heard that adage? Goodbye. You're getting nothing.]]></string>

<string id="543004"><![CDATA[Wait... What are you doing? Don't!]]></string>
<string id="543005"><![CDATA[You want to try and hide from the all-seeing eye?]]></string>

<string id="543018"><![CDATA[No, and I have no desire to. Be on your way, I don't want to talk to you.]]></string>
<string id="543019"><![CDATA[They say last night Simon Kain died. Nobody knows how it happened, but the main suspect is Artemy Burakh. And he killed his father too. ]]></string>
<string id="543020"><![CDATA[The two of them—first the Haruspex, then the Bachelor—will drown the town in blood.]]></string>
<string id="543021"><![CDATA[I don't believe it. The Warden is not a person to break the joint of time, he won't foul his hands with the blood of his kin. He has no reason to kill Simon, too.]]></string>

<string id="543028"><![CDATA[Oh, I wouldn't make it to a shop. Rumour has it they're full of sweet nothing anyway. Should've hoarded all I need in advance… Eh… had I known where I would fall I wouldn't have come to that place at all.]]></string>
<string id="543029"><![CDATA[Which in your case means you don’t belong anywhere.]]></string>
<string id="543030"><![CDATA[The town will have more stockpiles and hoards than people soon.]]></string>

Look at you with your hands folded and all—what if you turn your head a bit and your face is all twigs? You don't care about people. You're full of spite. I, for one, am going to keep an eye on you so that you wouldn't follow me anywhere.]]></string>
<string id="543052"><![CDATA[There's a community there, everybody knows that. So sometimes 'tis hard to make sense of them. Hopefully they won't start eating one another… 'cause there's not a crumb there otherwise. How long will they last? Their only hope's the Superior's daughter. They value her words, like, for real. Perhaps 'tis their salvation.]]></string>
<string id="543053"><![CDATA[Say they unlock the Termitary. What if it's infected? That means hundreds of sick men crazed with pain will pour into the streets. A horrible thought!]]></string>

<string id="543088"><![CDATA[Who knows—perhaps none of the three parties catches him.]]></string>
<string id="543090"><![CDATA[I'll tear you to pieces if I get my hands on you! Just you wait!]]></string>
<string id="543092"><![CDATA[So what about you? You're a brave guy, right? Or a mad one? Fill me in on the news.]]></string>
<string id="543095"><![CDATA[It's no point going to the shops now. Yeah. We'd rather search the warehouses for food. Gotta do the job tonight. And don't you even think about telling on us, you hear me? Or else!]]></string>
<string id="543096"><![CDATA[You shouldn't walk around the town at night. Anything can happen, you know.]]></string>
<string id="543098"><![CDATA[The prices will fall when there's nobody around to eat.]]></string>

<string id="543101"><![CDATA[What's the news?]]></string>
<string id="543102"><![CDATA[I have bartered a hook and three nuts today. The kiddos will be green with envy. Gave out three rifle rounds for them. Oh, if only I had a rifle! I'd so…]]></string>
<string id="543103"><![CDATA[Not bad.]]></string>
<string id="543104"><![CDATA[And what would you do?]]></string>
<string id="543105"><![CDATA[They'd be afraid to even come close to me! I can do without a rifle too! But bare fists are not enough when it's one against four... And father says there are... mafrauders now burgling abandoned houses—but they can break into ours too. And so I'd go—bang! In your face! They'd never try it again!]]></string>
<string id="543106"><![CDATA[Aren't you a hero. But my advice would be to avoid marauders. Even patrolmen can't always deal with them.]]></string>
<string id="543107"><![CDATA[Run home, will you? What if "mafrauders" come and you're not there?]]></string>
<string id="543108"><![CDATA[What's the news on the street? Seen anything worthwhile?]]></string>
<string id="543109"><![CDATA[Rumour has it, everyone who fights or just hangs around at night is a bandit. And what are we supposed to do, huh? If anyone lays a finger on me or one of my lot, they'll pay for it—and to hell with the new rules!]]></string>
<string id="543110"><![CDATA[Don't be so angry. Strength is not about fists.]]></string>

<string id="543113"><![CDATA[But what about medicine? We've searched every nook and cranny for shmowders. I wanted to get one for Dina. Just in case…]]></string>

<string id="543118"><![CDATA[Clara, something's looking for you... or someone... Anyway, Sticky's been tracking it, but he failed. And he's very good at this. A creepy creature.]]></string>
<string id="543119"><![CDATA[Do not worry about me. And thank you. ]]></string>
<string id="543120"><![CDATA[What does it look like? ]]></string>
<string id="543121"><![CDATA[I know. But who knows who is looking for whom and who finds whom first.]]></string>
<string id="543122"><![CDATA[Like nothing I've ever seen! 'Cause I haven't seen it. 'Cause it was Sticky tracking it, not me, I'm telling you.]]></string>
<string id="543123"><![CDATA[Why are you calling it creepy then? You haven't seen it!]]></string>
<string id="543124"><![CDATA[It's for the better that you haven't seen it. You don't need to.]]></string>
<string id="543125"><![CDATA[Well, you have come close to me already, so let's barter.]]></string>
<string id="543126"><![CDATA[I suggest you follow their example. ]]></string>
<string id="543127"><![CDATA[What's news? Still up to no good?]]></string>
<string id="543128"><![CDATA[You said you can heal with your hands. Is it for real? If one of my mates falls sick, will you help? Everyone's scared of you now, they say coming close to you is bad and dangerous and... Were you in the Cathedral yesterday?]]></string>
<string id="543129"><![CDATA[What are you talking about? Don't parrot nonsense. You have come close to me, haven't you? So what?]]></string>
<string id="543130"><![CDATA[So don't you come close! How's you blood, is it running cold already?]]></string>
<string id="543131"><![CDATA[I was in the Cathedral. But that's not why they got infected. Do you believe me? ]]></string>
<string id="543132"><![CDATA[I believe it wasn't you. Capella says so too—and she knows stuff. Too bad the Cathedral was hosting the hospital. My ma was there, and now they say they won't let her out, and I'm not allowed in.]]></string>
<string id="543133"><![CDATA[I'm very sorry. I wish I could help. ]]></string>
<string id="543134"><![CDATA[Any more news? Have you seen the creature that's been looking for me lately?]]></string>
<string id="543135"><![CDATA[I don't have time to deal with your problems. ]]></string>
<string id="543136"><![CDATA[Sticky says it's made of clay and bones. He followed it, but it disappeared into the Steppe. Ask Grace. Also someone's buying all the vitamins from us—and it takes like a kilo of them to be of any use.]]></string>
<string id="543137"><![CDATA[Into the Steppe, you say... All right. I'll check it out. Thank you! ]]></string>
<string id="543138"><![CDATA[I think I have an idea of who it might be.]]></string>

<string id="543140"><![CDATA[Do you think the Bachelor would give me a vaccine if I asked him, eh? He must have some. He used to test drugs in the Mouth and had some business with Rubin later. But we couldn't get a closer look back then.]]></string>
<string id="543141"><![CDATA[Even if his vaccine saves you, it'll take your soul away. ]]></string>
<string id="543142"><![CDATA[They failed miserably. They have no idea what they're up against!]]></string>
<string id="543143"><![CDATA[You'd better ask Rubin. He could help. ]]></string>
<string id="543144"><![CDATA[Yeah right, like I can ask him… He's a wanted man, thanks to the Kains—they're like mad dogs on the loose, they have all their men search for him. It's not like I'm a better searching party!]]></string>
<string id="543145"><![CDATA[You are so in the loop it's uncanny.]]></string>
<string id="543146"><![CDATA[Their vaccines are of no use anyway. You'll live longer without them.]]></string>
<string id="543147"><![CDATA[Barter? That would help me a lot.]]></string>
<string id="543148"><![CDATA[Got junk you don't need? Let's barter.]]></string>
<string id="543149"><![CDATA[Well, you are the only fearless and smart person around. You'll just have to live with that.]]></string>

<string id="543151"><![CDATA[If I bring nothing home today, my family will either starve or die from the disease. Could you help me in any way? Please spare some coins so that I could get medicine at least, please! I'll spread the word of your kindness.]]></string>

<string id="543164"><![CDATA[My arms and legs won't work properly, I've got fiery circles before my eyes. I feel hot, as though something was burning me from inside. I met a big-city doctor recently, he told me to lie down. But who's going to feed my family then?]]></string>
<string id="543165"><![CDATA[The Earth will eat all of you if you keep listening to him.]]></string>

<string id="543168"><![CDATA[I doubt you'll make it. Trouble has already come to live in your house. ]]></string>
<string id="543169"><![CDATA[I'll share what I can. But it will hardly help you, you look too bad. Well, at least you'll have a chance to save your family.]]></string>

<string id="543171"><![CDATA[Are you sick or something? ]]></string>
<string id="543172"><![CDATA[I have a fever, but it'll pass... The prices have risen tenfold. The water barrel by the Skinners got a leak… and the soil beneath it turned red. Nothing good will come of it.]]></string>
<string id="543173"><![CDATA[How would you know what comes of what? Be off—who knows how much time you still have to stumble in my way.]]></string>
<string id="543174"><![CDATA[Go home. Who knows how everything will turn out? We have to have faith while there still is at least a shred of hope left. ]]></string>
<string id="543176"><![CDATA[How are you feeling now? ]]></string>
<string id="543177"><![CDATA[I know I'm about to die. My bloodflow is slowing down, making the veins groan; my chest is on fire… We will all follow in the Ruler's footsteps. But even as we die, we won't be able to leave this place. We shall become the Sand Plague's body, its dead cells...]]></string>
<string id="543178"><![CDATA[You're right. You are all too keen; and so your end is nigh. ]]></string>
<string id="543179"><![CDATA[Go home. Who knows how everything will turn out? We need to be patient—just a little longer.]]></string>
<string id="543180"><![CDATA[My children, oh my poor little darlings… You make my heart bleed… What will become of you? Ah girl, you'll know what caring for your children is like when you grow up.]]></string>

<string id="543191"><![CDATA[Is it hard on you?]]></string>
<string id="543192"><![CDATA[We are all mere orphans without Simon. We have neither a true Mistress, nor a Ruler in the town. After all, Katerina is not Victoria. ]]></string>
<string id="543193"><![CDATA[There are other forces that can save the town. ]]></string>
<string id="543194"><![CDATA[Ill words yield ill circumstances. You'll call trouble upon your head. ]]></string>
<string id="543195"><![CDATA[There's no point talking about it.]]></string>
<string id="543196"><![CDATA[Simon's gone for good now. The body's gone. Or maybe he has simply gone somewhere on his own—people say all kinds of things… Perhaps the Immortal Man is still alive. He would have restored order.]]></string>
<string id="543197"><![CDATA["Order", pah. It's always about order with you.]]></string>
<string id="543198"><![CDATA[I think even Simon would have been powerless to. And the most horrible is yet to come.]]></string>
<string id="543199"><![CDATA[Couldn't be worse! Have you seen the prices? We've been told to burn everything, bury it, and wait for the fresh goods. They used the pest as a scarecrow, and now they're lining their pockets. What can we do? People are starving. Some of us can't trudge through a single day without food.]]></string>
<string id="543200"><![CDATA[Everyone's staying in, too afraid to go outside. There are only couriers and patrolmen in the streets. And I hear someone crying constantly next door… It's all that big-city doctor, he brought it all on us. Why did he have to come? There's a quarantine now. And there won't be a train.]]></string>
<string id="543201"><![CDATA[It's not just starvation. Twyre is in bloom and so the earth is spending its lifeforces elsewhere—instead of sharing with you.]]></string>
<string id="543202"><![CDATA[I'm sorry. So, so sorry! If only I could save you all…]]></string>
<string id="543203"><![CDATA[There's no point complaining. Just accept the upcoming suffering. No one is to blame for it.]]></string>
<string id="543204"><![CDATA[You ain't seen nothing yet. Your current blights will pale in comparison with what is to come.]]></string>
<string id="543205"><![CDATA[It's the souls of the people that the Earth wouldn't accept. You poor soul—if you hear them, you will have no peace at all soon.]]></string>
<string id="543206"><![CDATA[Isn't he the one who is maintaining the order you care about so much? Weren't you talking about it before? He will do it with an iron fist. And he'll destroy anything that doesn't fit his idea of order.]]></string>
<string id="543207"><![CDATA[You think the local quacks are better? The Bachelor will crush everything that doesn't fit his idea of order, true, but the Haruspex will cut anything that is not his kin.]]></string>
<string id="543208"><![CDATA[Do you have a needle and a thread? Please mend my clothes, I'll pay you. ]]></string>
<string id="543209"><![CDATA[Hi there! Do you know how to play Reflections? You don't seem like an ordinary girl. I wonder what you'd look like coming out on the other side!]]></string>
<string id="543210"><![CDATA[Trade? I'm sure I have something you might like.]]></string>
<string id="543211"><![CDATA[Wanna barter? See what I've got.]]></string>
<string id="543212"><![CDATA[Do you have anything of interest? Shall we barter? Do take a look, perhaps you'll find a use for this thingie of mine?]]></string>
<string id="543213"><![CDATA[There is not a path in the world that would be unavailable to me. I shall penetrate the Polyhedron as well… in due time.]]></string>
<string id="543214"><![CDATA[Hi! I remember you—I was just this high back then, and you were probably even smaller. Is something bothering you?]]></string>
<string id="543215"><![CDATA[Just consider the thing standing before you a Reflection of mine. And I myself am already far, far away.]]></string>
<string id="543216"><![CDATA[Do you? Sorry, I can't remember at all... Say, how does a House of the Living work? I think Lara wants to found one... If I don't end up there, does that mean I'm dead?]]></string>
<string id="543219"><![CDATA[Go home! It's not safe outside.]]></string>
<string id="543220"><![CDATA[No, it's vice versa; if you do end up there, you'll only get out feet first.]]></string>
<string id="543221"><![CDATA[Why would you want to go to the House of the Living?]]></string>
<string id="543222"><![CDATA[I don't. If anything happens, we will all hide in the Polyhedron. Khan says it's the safest place in the world.  No adults allowed though.]]></string>
<string id="543223"><![CDATA[Sounds like a good idea.]]></string>
<string id="543225"><![CDATA[So how many of you are in there now?]]></string>
<string id="543226"><![CDATA[A lot. Yesterday the father of one of our guys was killed by the Station, and now the lad won't say a word. Khan says he's better off in the Tower; it lets you see those who are already gone.]]></string>
<string id="543227"><![CDATA[Kaspar thinks he knows something that others don't?]]></string>
<string id="543228"><![CDATA[That poor fellow. Are you sure it wouldn't be better for him to go home? He has some family left, I hope?]]></string>
<string id="543230"><![CDATA[Khan wouldn't just offer random advice—he means it. Plus the lad's family has enough mouths to feed as it is. Ah, I have to go get the groceries! Ugh, what am I supposed to tell Mom? The prices are rising by the hour!]]></string>
<string id="543231"><![CDATA[People just got scared, is all. The freight train won't come, but, on the other hand, the population is diminishing, so it crosses out.]]></string>
<string id="543232"><![CDATA[Trust me, if this town is to die at all—it is not to starve… not physically anyway.]]></string>
<string id="543233"><![CDATA[Did you catch the Unseen cat?]]></string>
<string id="543234"><![CDATA[Are you making fun of me? It's fine, no hard feelings. You do very well know that there is no Unseen cat. That said though, your eyes sure do remind me of it. Are you a Soul-and-a-Half? But you don't have a pet…]]></string>
<string id="543235"><![CDATA[No, I only have one soul. I'm here to help.]]></string>
<string id="543236"><![CDATA[It is beyond your abilities to comprehend me. We may very well meet again.]]></string>
<string id="543237"><![CDATA[I invited the Bachelor to have a look at the Unseen cat, but I know he won't come. He doesn't seem to understand us at all. Is it true that he's very smart?]]></string>
<string id="543238"><![CDATA[Intelligence is relative. Often the voice of reason tangles the ways of fate, whereas the heart always leads you down the right path.]]></string>
<string id="543239"><![CDATA[That big-city doctor will do a lot of damage! He can't see past his nose without a microscope. You'd be better off not talking to him at all.]]></string>
<string id="543240"><![CDATA[Are you looking for something?]]></string>
<string id="543241"><![CDATA[Everyone's looking for shmowders. The lads found some in the Silly House, in the Crude Sprawl. But they're all "dead"—and now no one seems to remember the correct recipes… All of our stashes are empty—weird, isn't it?]]></string>
<string id="543242"><![CDATA[Weird indeed. Why would anyone want those things? They do more harm than good anyway.]]></string>
<string id="543243"><![CDATA[How is it possible that no one knows how to mix a proper shmowder anymore?]]></string>
<string id="543244"><![CDATA[Crowfoot used to make good shmowders... but he's gotten rusty. I mean, we used to mix anything we could find. I never tried the results, but some of us did—and they kicked the bucket. My beau promised to get me one if I ever need it.]]></string>
<string id="543245"><![CDATA[Do you really want to take this risk? It can be poisonous…]]></string>
<string id="543246"><![CDATA[It's not medicine that cures, trust me.]]></string>
<string id="543247"><![CDATA[Will you play with us?]]></string>
<string id="543248"><![CDATA[I'm in a terrible hurry, dear. Next time perhaps.]]></string>
<string id="543249"><![CDATA[Of course. What are you playing today?]]></string>
<string id="543250"><![CDATA[How about we barter instead?]]></string>
<string id="543251"><![CDATA[Not now, darling. But soon I will.]]></string>
<string id="543252"><![CDATA[Honey, I want you to know... We won't be able to play for quite some time.]]></string>
<string id="543253"><![CDATA[Have you forgotten? It's autumn! And autumn is Underground Bonfire time. Ha ha… And Uncle Bachelor tried to tell a lie. He said he used to play it too.]]></string>
<string id="543254"><![CDATA[He never lies, sunshine. Maybe it was a joke. That is exactly what's so horrifying about him: he doesn't recognize anything but the truth. And everything that sounds even remotely false, he exterminates. But hey, why am I saying this? You're too young to understand.]]></string>
<string id="543255"><![CDATA[Aren't you afraid to play such a game?]]></string>
<string id="543256"><![CDATA[We'll play every game in the world very soon, you and I.]]></string>
<string id="543257"><![CDATA[Don't talk to him. And don't listen to anything he says about me. You hear me? It's all lies.]]></string>
<string id="543258"><![CDATA[So he won't be able to get into the Tower, right? What if he thinks that it's also a lie? I mean, he won't be able to see everything no matter how hard he tries, he's very much a grown-up already.]]></string>
<string id="543259"><![CDATA[Hey, I underestimated you! No worries. I won't let anyone change anything around here. We'll play in the Polyhedron yet, I promise.]]></string>
<string id="543260"><![CDATA[No, I'm brave! I fear nothing!]]></string>
<string id="543261"><![CDATA[Yes, my love, you are the bravest. Now go and play. I have a lot on my plate right now.]]></string>
<string id="543262"><![CDATA[What's that on your little palms? Have you been playing in the mud? Found anything interesting? Something that may be of use to me, perhaps?]]></string>
<string id="543263"><![CDATA[Soon is a long time from now...]]></string>
<string id="543264"><![CDATA[Who knows? Turn that frown upside down, sunshine.]]></string>
<string id="543265"><![CDATA[Promise me you won't be wandering around here for a couple of days, okay? Or better yet, go to the Tower. If you don't listen to me, something bad might happen.]]></string>
<string id="543266"><![CDATA[That's it, I don't have time for this. Off you go, buddy.]]></string>
<string id="543267"><![CDATA[You can't play because of that monster chasing you, right? Is it true that it's a maneater who is looking to eat you?]]></string>
<string id="543268"><![CDATA[Have you seen it as well?]]></string>
<string id="543269"><![CDATA[Repeat after me: there are no maneaters! It's just spooky tales.]]></string>
<string id="543270"><![CDATA[What did I just say? Off you go!]]></string>
<string id="543271"><![CDATA[No, Sticky told me. What if it eats you? Will you then be stuck inside of it? Then we won't play for sure...]]></string>
<string id="543272"><![CDATA[I'll eat him! And I'll have a bite of you too if you keep getting in my way!]]></string>
<string id="543273"><![CDATA[Sticky! Well, if I find this boy…! And you—don't listen to idle nonsense... Do you really think there is a thing in the world that can eat me?]]></string>
<string id="543274"><![CDATA[Don't come near me, sunshine. I'm not feeling too good. Go home.]]></string>
<string id="543275"><![CDATA[No.]]></string>
<string id="543276"><![CDATA[Come on, trade with your friend Clara... Look what I've got!]]></string>
<string id="543277"><![CDATA[What's that in your eyes? Here, look at me...]]></string>
<string id="543278"><![CDATA[You said you'd play with me yet. And they say you'll be caught tomorrow. Did you tell me a lie then?]]></string>
<string id="543279"><![CDATA[What are talking about? If I hear that again, I'll grab you, cook you and give your legs to the odonghs!]]></string>

<string id="543282"><![CDATA[Yeah, well... You don't really look like you want to play today.]]></string>
<string id="543283"><![CDATA[They said the Inquisitor would arrive and everything would be in the right order again. But instead came this lady. A bad lady! Dad went out yesterday and never came back. Mom is crying, she says we are all going to die soon. What's it like, Clara? And when will Dad come back?]]></string>
<string id="543284"><![CDATA[I'm sorry, darling, you won't see him for some time now.]]></string>
<string id="543285"><![CDATA[You won't ever see him again. He's dead. And your mother is right, you will all be there one day.]]></string>
<string id="543286"><![CDATA[I'll do my best to fix something at least, sweetie. The bad lady will pay for this. Now go back to your mom. I'll take care of you.]]></string>
<string id="543287"><![CDATA[I know you. You're Clara. They also call you the Changeling.]]></string>
<string id="543288"><![CDATA[Well, since we already know each other, how about we trade?]]></string>
<string id="543289"><![CDATA[Time will tell, pumpkin.]]></string>
<string id="543290"><![CDATA[Aren't they waiting for you at home?]]></string>
<string id="543291"><![CDATA[I used to be allowed to play until late. We would all go to visit Grandpa. And now he's gone. They said it's for real. Gone completely! And there's nothing left, not even a smallest piece of him.]]></string>
<string id="543292"><![CDATA[I have no idea why Simon was wasting his time on you. Didn't he have anything better to do?]]></string>
<string id="543293"><![CDATA[It's all right. Soon you'll be old enough to play in the Tower. You'll have your own games then.]]></string>
<string id="543294"><![CDATA[Tell me about the "Taglur".]]></string>
<string id="543295"><![CDATA[Hi there! Are you all right?]]></string>
<string id="543296"><![CDATA[It's a game about a circle! You join hands, and then again and again and again. Until the end.]]></string>
<string id="543297"><![CDATA[End? What end?]]></string>
<string id="543298"><![CDATA[Never thought it was a children's game.]]></string>
<string id="543299"><![CDATA[Until the circle closes. That's the end of the game.]]></string>
<string id="543300"><![CDATA[Why did you ask then? Or do you mean the other game? I can't talk about that.]]></string>
<string id="543301"><![CDATA[All right, bye, pumpkin. Good luck with your circle.]]></string>
<string id="543302"><![CDATA[All right, so long, pumpkin. Good luck with your circle.]]></string>
<string id="543303"><![CDATA[Bad child! You're useless…]]></string>
<string id="543304"><![CDATA[Don't bother me with your silliness.]]></string>
<string id="543305"><![CDATA[General Ashes is coming tomorrow to grind us all to dust. That's what Daddy says.]]></string>
<string id="543306"><![CDATA[As long as I'm here, everything will stay as it has always been, sunshine. Don't bother your pretty head with it.]]></string>
<string id="543307"><![CDATA[Nonsense. Tell me something good for a change.]]></string>
<string id="543310"><![CDATA[Well, it's good that we have the Bachelor. He's so scary he'll probably scare the general away!]]></string>
<string id="543311"><![CDATA[Only to abuse you himself. Don't even think about trusting that mendacious demon.]]></string>
<string id="543312"><![CDATA[You're right, pumpkin. Even the scariest man can serve a good cause...]]></string>
<string id="543313"><![CDATA[Are you judging me? Or do you sympathize?]]></string>
<string id="543314"><![CDATA[Neither. Why would you need my sympathy? Or do you have something to be judged for?]]></string>
<string id="543315"><![CDATA[I simply don't have anything to say to you.]]></string>
<string id="543316"><![CDATA[Aren't you cold? The weather is deceptive in fall.]]></string>
<string id="543317"><![CDATA[If nothing makes you warm, then that means there's no warmth inside you.]]></string>
<string id="543318"><![CDATA[It's all the same to me, be it sympathy or judgement. I can't even feel the cold.]]></string>
<string id="543319"><![CDATA[I feel nothing. I'm empty inside, so what does it matter if it's hot or cold outside?]]></string>
<string id="543320"><![CDATA[If nothing makes you warm, then that means there's no warmth inside you.]]></string>
<string id="543321"><![CDATA[Whatever.]]></string>
<string id="543323"><![CDATA[I know the dance. When I dance, I exist. I offer my juices to the earth, luring twyre out of it. But after that, when twyre blooms, I don't get drunk with the odour.]]></string>
<string id="543324"><![CDATA[You do make me feel empty.]]></string>
<string id="543325"><![CDATA[So it's you who we owe the twyre blooming to? I don't know if you are to be thanked.]]></string>
<string id="543326"><![CDATA[Find your own way. Perhaps you'll find yourself before it all ends.]]></string>
<string id="543327"><![CDATA[Whatever.]]></string>
<string id="543328"><![CDATA[Can I be of assistance?]]></string>
<string id="543329"><![CDATA[What could there be inside such a monstrosity? I find it unbelievable that it's still standing at all. I'd never let my children enter the damn thing. Ever.]]></string>
<string id="543330"><![CDATA[You mean the Polyhedron? Why wouldn't you take the children's word for that? Are you so sure you're smarter than they are?]]></string>
<string id="543331"><![CDATA[I don't think they're going to ask for your permission. You can't prohibit dreams.]]></string>
<string id="543332"><![CDATA[That's where children's dreams live. Perhaps yours is among them as well. Did you dream when you were a child?]]></string>
<string id="543333"><![CDATA[No wonder they call you deranged. What's next? Are you going to suggest we all fall on our knees and worship it or something?]]></string>
<string id="543334"><![CDATA[This is pointless. I'm not going to waste time bashing my head against a brick wall.]]></string>
<string id="543335"><![CDATA[You're right about one thing—soon you will all be doing what I suggest you do.]]></string>
<string id="543336"><![CDATA[No, thank you.]]></string>
<string id="543337"><![CDATA[Good morals and luck are a great help in managing a small community without resorting to violence. Personal standing can work wonders.]]></string>
<string id="543338"><![CDATA[Excuse me. I'm in a hurry. ]]></string>
<string id="543339"><![CDATA[You should be listening more carefully. I like our town. We're all one big family. But sometimes I get the feeling that we're all controlled by an unseen power, our actions but fiction.]]></string>
<string id="543340"><![CDATA[I don't think I can relate to that.]]></string>
<string id="543341"><![CDATA[You're not far from the truth. ]]></string>
<string id="543342"><![CDATA[I'm surprised by how calm you are. Borderline smug.]]></string>
<string id="543343"><![CDATA[The vaccine is a protective agent. It's a weakened specimen of the disease that our body can fight off. After you've suffered through the process, the body becomes resistant to it.]]></string>
<string id="543344"><![CDATA[And what if it falls? The Tower with its fragile stem, all those unnatural structures? I'd rather the working districts were fenced off.]]></string>
<string id="543345"><![CDATA[But why do people hoard vaccine ampulas then? Something's not right here. ]]></string>
<string id="543346"><![CDATA[We've only got experimental vaccine now. The body fights it for a while, but then it stops.]]></string>
<string id="543347"><![CDATA[I've heard about it before, I think. So you believe in this panacea?]]></string>
<string id="543348"><![CDATA[You see, my father used to deliver mail. It's a huge risk. His health is badly damaged by the abundance of various chemicals. He's coughing blood and has a constant headache… He's been bed-ridden for two days in a row. I'm so worried about him!]]></string>
<string id="543349"><![CDATA[Hm. I see. So it provides permanent protection?]]></string>
<string id="543351"><![CDATA[Yeah, sure, I really hope it helps you.]]></string>
<string id="543352"><![CDATA[So a working vaccine is coming soon?]]></string>
<string id="543353"><![CDATA[You're amazingly knowledgeable! Get lost, doll. You have no idea what you're talking about.]]></string>
<string id="543354"><![CDATA[Salvation is not about vaccines.]]></string>
<string id="543355"><![CDATA[Thanks. You're an invaluable source of information.]]></string>
<string id="543357"><![CDATA[If you ever see the Bachelor, please kindly tell him it's rubbish. His facts and figures will save no one.]]></string>
<string id="543358"><![CDATA[Forgive me, I did not know. I am truly sorry to hear that, but I still doubt the Bachelor's vaccine will help. It lacks a crucial component.]]></string>
<string id="543359"><![CDATA[I am sorry... ]]></string>
<string id="543360"><![CDATA[Many more will pass away before the solution is found.]]></string>
<string id="543361"><![CDATA[I think it is highly unlikely. But you're entitled to your opinion, of course.]]></string>
<string id="543362"><![CDATA[Don't you like the Polyhedron? ]]></string>
<string id="543364"><![CDATA[No, of course I do! It's wonderful. But the more children gather there, the more anxious I feel. It's so shaky... And my girl is spending all her time there.]]></string>
<string id="543365"><![CDATA[Do not worry, it is more stable than most buildings in this town. ]]></string>
<string id="543366"><![CDATA[Rubbish! Relocate to a different place then.]]></string>
<string id="543367"><![CDATA[*** Maria will not get this necklace.]]></string>
<string id="543368"><![CDATA[*** I don't like her behaviour in the slightest. It's as if she is hiding something. Is she disillusioned? Did someone scare her? What is on my dear mother's mind? I am going to have to talk to her later.]]></string>
<string id="543369"><![CDATA[*** There. Not a sign of Andrey. Not a trace of the body either. I wonder what I should do now?]]></string>
