6192354999753851 Panacea
6192354999754053 Money
6192354999754054 On the third day of the epidemic local prices went through the roof; now, on the eighth day, very few people agree to actually trade for money, preferring barter instead. The latter is more cumbersome, but can yield lucrative rewards.
6192354999754055 Oddly enough, money is used to buy items in shops. Offering it during common street barter, however, would be seen as offensive.\n
6192354999754056 Canned Food
6192354999754057 The can is completely airproof, guaranteeing that its contents are uninfected. The food itself is nutritious.
6192354999754058 Nutritious, neatly-packed and well-preserved food that somehow doesn't require a can opener. There's no manufacturer brand on the can and it's far from obvious what type of food is inside.
6192354999754059 Bread
6192354999754060 Bread is the staff of life. No food is more filling.
6192354999754061 Anything that's baked of dough can be called bread. The local variety is greyish in color and crumbly to the touch, making you doubt if it was actually made from grain. Surprisingly delicious though.
6192354999754062 Milk
6192354999754063 Oddly warm and creamy, as though milked minutes ago, this common nourishing drink can often be found as an offering at cemeteries.
6192354999754064 Often used an an offering to the dead, milk serves as a reminder that all that is born must come to an end. It's so popular in the town that cream separators can be found even in the households that seemingly have nothing to do with the local Bull Project.
6192354999754065 Walnut
6192354999754066 While nuts can be munched down, they do little to sate hunger. Why then do the local kids' eyes light up when they see one?
6192354999754067 Used in the most popular game among local children, nuts are forbidden in the Polyhedron, where most of the kids fled from the plague. The "voices of nuts" were said to make the facets of the Polyhedron resonate in a bad way.
6192354999754068 Peanuts
6192354999754069 While nuts can be munched down, they do little to sate hunger. Why then do the local kids' eyes light up when they see one?
6192354999754070 Used in the most popular game among local children, nuts are forbidden in the Polyhedron, where most of the kids fled from the plague. The "voices of nuts" were said to make the facets of the Polyhedron resonate in a bad way.
6192354999754071 Chestnuts
6192354999754072 While chestnuts are nuts, they're unedible without cooking. The local children still take a keen interest in them. 
6192354999754073 Despite the lack of chestnut trees around, chestnuts are omnipresent in the town. Where do they come from?
6192354999754074 Raisins
6192354999754075 Formerly juicy berries, currently a luxurious treat that leaves one's mouth sugary when eaten.
6192354999754076 A luxurious imported treat. The locals refuse to eat more than a couple at a time; perhaps this has to do with the fact that raisins do not spoil and thus become the only treat available during food shortages.
6192354999754077 Cracker
6192354999754078 Soldier food. There's no reason to prefer it to freshly baked bread.
6192354999754079 Leaving bread to go stale or dry is heavily frowned upon. Crackers arrived to the town with soldiers' rations and remain unpopular despite being decently filling.
6192354999754080 Water Bottle
6192354999754081 Seemingly sates hunger a bit. Despite the town standing on the river Gorkhon, fresh drinking water is a rare commodity here.
6192354999754082 Fresh water is brought to the town daily from a spring in the steppe and distributed among the households by water-bearers. The Gorkhon water was proven to be clean, but the locals refuse to drink it.
6192354999754083 Immune Boosters
6192354999754084 Assorted pills of unknown origin. Boost immunity. Side effects include nausea and the inability to smell almonds.
6192354999754085 Scientifically speaking, it is dubious whether immunity can be boosted at all. However, these pills work infallibly. According to the box, they were manufactured more than fifty years ago.
6192354999754086 Antibiotic
6192354999754087 The best way not to get infected is to be dead. Antibiotics, that lower infection at the price of general health. are the first step in that direction.
6192354999754088 "Bios" means life, which encompasses all that is living, including both the harmful bacteria and humans. Antibiotics attack both. The difference is that while they can kill a person dead, a couple of bacteria always escapes their assault, so it's impossible to cure yourself fully with antibiotics only.
6192354999754089 Morphine
6192354999754090 A person is only alive for as long as they feel pain. Morphine makes you numb to it, seemingly increasing health.
6192354999754091 Unsuccessfully banned within the limits of the town by governor Saburov, who was trying to alleviate his wife's addiction, morphine relieves a person of pain, worries, and wordly desires, leaving them in a drowsy and numb state.
6192354999754092 Executor Mask
6192354999754093 Protective headwear. Replaces all smells with that of the healing herbs placed in the beak. 
6192354999754094 The mask of Muu Shubuun, "the wicked bird"; part of the Reaper costume from the local theatre. Impossible to see through, it's actually mounted above an actor's head, making them peek through a hole in the cloak.
6192354999754095 Executor Cloak
6192354999754096 Protective garment. The pendants serve no obvious purpose, yet it loses its protective qualities if stripped of them.
6192354999754097 Orderlies—the volunteer medical assistants—use the costumes borrowed from the local theatre as protective cloaks. This is the traditional costume of the Reaper, an allegory of Death.
6192354999754098 Cothurni
6192354999754099 Protective footwear. Rising above your troubles (and the plague-soaked ground) is as simple as wearing these theatrical shoes.
6192354999754100 Cothurni—unusual footwear that elevates the wearer hight above the ground—are popular with the local theatre. It is likely that the orderlies owe their awe-inspiring height to them.
6192354999754101 Leather Gloves
6192354999754102 Protective handwear. The local leatherworks are a less-known branch of Fat Vlad's Bull Project.
6192354999754103 Leather gloves are still associated with the desire not to leave fingerprints, which is, to say the least, shady. A small price to pay when dealing with something extremely unpleasant to the touch.
6192354999754104 Face Mask
6192354999754105 A basic protective item that covers the face.
6192354999754106 Common among medical personnel, this protective mask accumulates infection fast, quickly becoming a hazard in and of itself, and muffles speech. Still, better than nothing.
6192354999754107 A run-of-the-mill medicine vial filled with clotty reddish liquid that vaguely smells of spices. It seems distantly familiar.
6192354999754108 Shortly before his tragic demise, Artemy Burakh, a local pellar, claimed to have produced a miraculous cure capable of erasing the sand plague completely from one's body. Until now, his claims remained unproven. This may be the only sample in existence.
6192354999754109 Bandage
6192354999754110 Common bandages stop bleeding or can be fashioned into a makeshift noose if you've contracted the sand plague.
6192354999754111 It is common folk knowledge that any affliction can be overcome with the application of bandage and that any decently soft and clean cloth can serve as one. Makes one wonder how the people with such advanced medical knowledge even get sick at all.
6192354999754112 Tourniquet
6192354999754113 Used to repair health. Rubber tourniquets are regarded as poor-quality by the towsfolk, who prefer the locally-made leather ones.
6192354999754114 The rumor that General Block, the chief commanding officer of the soldiers deployed to the town, hanged himself on a noose made of tourniquets rather than succumb to the disease, is absurd and unfounded. This rubber band can't support the weight of a grown man.
6192354999754115 Key
6192354999754116 It's cold.
6192354999754117 The light reflects from it at odd angles, making one unable to discern the size of this key.
6192354999754118 Lockpick
6192354999754119 Twisted an uneven, the local lockpicks require a fast, jabbing motion to unlock a door, else they'll become uncoiled.
6192354999754120 It is said that Clara the Changeling, a thief girl who claims to be blessed, can open any door just as easily as she heals the sick, by laying on hands. Why are her pockets always filled with lockpicks then?
6192354999754121 Beetle
6192354999754122 A surprising, if useless, find in autumn.
6192354999754123 Some fifteen years ago, the Soul-and-a-Halves, the gang of children who are defined by sharing special bonds with their pets, actually considered to allow flower chafers as their "Halves" due to the beeltes "looking as though they knew something". The idea was quickly abandoned as ridiculous.
6192354999754124 Package
6192354999754125 The steppe people bury the remains of their dead in small packages. This is hardly one of them, but you'd rather not check.
6192354999754126 Long before the current socioeconomic catastrophe, the local townsfolk developed a tradition of barter that the whole community revelled in. Including many types, such as "tit for tat" and "retrab", it is sometimes secret, with people swapping wrapped items blindly.
6192354999754127 Match
6192354999754128 Long or short? Draw the short one!
6192354999754129 One must remember that which is most dear to them before the match burns out, or else the whole thing won't work.
6192354999754130 Spindle
6192354999754131 It has almost run out of thread.
6192354999754132 One can hardly jab a finger with this thing on accident. However, a hand can probably be puctured through by it, if enough pressure is applied.
6192354999754133 Candle Stub
6192354999754134 The stub of a nupital candle. It smells of earth.
6192354999754135 Eva Yan, the mistress of the Stillwater, often burned candles in the study during the night, which gave her observatory-like mansion a cozier appearance. After Eva's tragic suicide, candles can no longer be lit in the Stillwater and go out immediately.
6192354999754136 Used Bandage
6192354999754137 The traces of the epidemic are omnipresent.
6192354999754138 According to the sanitary procedures, any object that bears the traces of a deceased person's blood must be burned. According to the local belief, it's pointless since the blood would simply appear elsewhere.
6192354999754139 Broken Ampoule
6192354999754140 People would use any and all means possible to cure themselves of the disease.
6192354999754141 An ampoule that used to contain either life-saving or life-ending drug, served its purpose (whatever it was), and has now become completely useless.
6192354999754142 Powder
6192354999754143 The box seems to be filled with powder made of assorted ground pills. It's hard to picture a person who would produce such a mixture.
6192354999754144 Powders, or "shmowders", as the kids call them, can sometimes cure any disease completely. Or at least they used to; Khan, the children's leader who now rules the Polyhedron, claims that all the real "shmowders" were used up long before the epidemic.
6192354999754145 Bull Bell
6192354999754146 Did it bring luck to the one who wore it?
6192354999754147 The inner surface of this bell is flecked with the sigils of the secret and sacred steppe alphabet. It is the knowledge of this alphabet that allowed Artemy Burakh, a local pellar, to restore his rightful place in the steppe community—shortly before his tragic death.
6192354999754148 Pocket Watch
6192354999754149 Recently stopped. This means that the owner has most likely died.
6192354999754150 TIme doesn't seem to be working properly in the town; there's no other explanation to the fact that Georgiy Kain, the Judge, is two times younger than his twin brother. The Kains' fascination with all things clockwork must have something to do with this.
6192354999754251 Broken Scissors
6192354999754252 The Moerae must have been in a hurry—too many threads to cut these days.
6192354999754253 It is said that Clara the Changeling, a thief girl who claims to be a saint, can repair any sharp object just as easily as she cures the sand pest—by simply laying her hands on it. Perhaps this is the reason why people refuse to throw away useless junk like broken scissors.
6192354999754254 Fishing Hooks
6192354999754255 Sharp objects are regarded as dangerous and thus frowned upon by the locals.
6192354999754256 While the Gorkhon river has plenty of fish, fishing is for some reason unpopular among the locals. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that hooks are sharp objects, which are heavily frowned upon around here.
6192354999754257 Marbles
6192354999754258 Children give them names, as though they were alive, and believe them to hold memories.
6192354999754259 No one knows how exactly marbles appear in the town. No one delivers or makes them. They simply pop up here and there; on the floor, under the pillow, or right on the ground.
6192354999754260 Heart
6192354999754261 A warm heart that went out to people. Literally.
6192354999754262 In the steppe lore, the center of mind and knowledge is the liver, while the center of feeling and emotion is the lower guts. They view the heart as a less crucial and rather mechanical organ that simply pumps life around, oddly arriving at a consensus with science-based medicine.
6192354999754263 Liver
6192354999754264 Cutting open any bodies, including human, is taboo in our town. According to the "Baur Meges" steppe myth, the wholeness, harmony, and finiteness of the body are sacred. Only a person who possesses knowledge has the caste right to break this wholeness. Such people are allowed to work as doctors, butchers, or tattoo makers.
6192354999754265 A human liver.
6192354999754266 Kidney
6192354999754267 Kidney
6192354999754268 A human kidney.
6192354999754269 A human kidney.
6192354999754270 According to the steppe beliefs, the body is a perfect representation of the Universe. However, the steppe people are not so naive as to correlate organs and bones to cosmic or geographical features. What they refer to are, first and foremost, connections and circulations.
6192354999754271 According to the steppe beliefs, the body is a perfect representation of the Universe. However, the steppe people are not so naive as to correlate organs and bones to cosmic or geographical features. What they refer to are, first and foremost, connections and circulations.
6192354999754272 Brain
6192354999754273 A section of brain tissue.
6192354999754274 Among medical conditions, the gravest and most dangerous are those that destroy consciousness, thought, and perception. The key to defeating any unknown disease is in the head.
6192354999754275 Revolver
6192354999754276 A six-chambered military-grade revolver.
6192354999754277 The civil war has been going on for more than two years now. The hostility has mostly passed out hellhole by, but refugees and deserters keep bringing military-grade equipment to the furthest parts of the country.
6192354999754278 Bullet
6192354999754279 Revolver ammo.
6192354999754280 Black powder. A lead flat-nosed bullet. It's heavy, weighing more than 17 grams. Contrary to the popular belief, doesn't always find its billet.
6192354999754281 Empty Flask
6192354999754282 An empty flask made of thick glass.
6192354999754283 Flasks are rarely used to store water—they are better suited for thicker liquids, like mercury, oil, or blood. 
6192354999754284 Blood-filled Flask
6192354999754285 A blood-filled flask.
6192354999754286 At a low temperature liquid blood can be preserved for up to three weeks, with enough red cells surviving. At a different temperature blood needs to be transfused within an hour. Blood used for tests remains usable for a day. 
6192354999754287 Chalk
6192354999754288 A piece of chalk. Rough and unpleasant to the touch.
6192354999754289 The locals inexplicably detest chalk. Despite its eye-catching whiteness, it is considered unclean and is popularly associated with bad omens and doom. Chalk-marked train cars are washed with river water before they are unloaded.
6192354999754290 Empty Bottle
6192354999754291 A clean bottle. Can be filled with water.
6192354999754292 No one drinks water from the Gorkhon river in our town, which is quite sensible. No one digs wells either, which is less so. Clear drinkable water is not a luxury, but is valued. It is brought from the steppe, and people can often tell which spring it is from by the taste.
6192354999760851 
6192354999814051 
6192354999814651 
6192354999814652 
6192354999858651 Meradorm
6192354999858652 Meradorm has a strong sedative effect and induces sleep even during excruciating pain. 
6192354999858653 Meradorm has a strong sedative effect and induces sleep even during excruciating pain. 
6192354999858654 Twyrine
6192354999858655 A strong infusion of the oxitocia tvirinum herb. Boosts immunity. Acts as an analgesic, restores strength during sleep. According to elder locals, critical doses of twyrine can alter the effects of infection. Some of the effects of twyrine are still unknown.
6192354999858656 A strong infusion of the oxitocia tvirinum herb. Boosts immunity. Acts as an analgesic, restores strength during sleep. According to elder locals, critical doses of twyrine can alter the effects of infection. Some of the effects of twyrine are still unknown.
6192354999858657 White Vaccine
6192354999858658 The final variant of the "organic vaccine". A unique prophylactic drug based on a live culture of the Sand Plague. 
6192354999858659 The final variant of the "organic vaccine". A unique prophylactic drug based on a live culture of the Sand Plague. 
6192354999869451 We shall speak later. We have much to talk about. Not here.
6192354999869452 Greetings, ekhene, how fares your kine? Who might you be?
6192354999869453 Did you come to pay respects to my father?
6192354999869454 Mind me not. Your Khatanghe, your people, are over there. Burying your father.
6192354999869455 What about you?
6192354999869456 Very well.
6192354999869457 I have paid my respects already. I came here to watch you. To see what you do. I wait for your word, emshen. Then I shall give you mine.
6192354999869458 What am I <i>supposed</i> to do?
6192354999869459 Why can't they bury him?
6192354999869460 They will tell you. Then you will reply. I watch.
6192354999869461 Okay, watch.
6192354999869462 …
6192354999869463 You will soon know.
6192354999869464 Another riddle…
6192354999869465 Fine.
6192354999869466 What do you make of this, emshen?
6192354999869467 They're talking about an inescapable obligation, a bond… Do you know anything about it?
6192354999869468 Seems like Father owed a lot. But… to whom?
6192354999869469 No.
6192354999869470 Then who does?
6192354999869471 How can I take such an obligation upon myself? What if I fail to meet it?
6192354999869472 You choose. So, what is your choice? Who do you release him to? Sky or Earth?
6192354999869473 What does this choice even mean?
6192354999869474 I am afraid of taking on his burden. I give him to the Sky.
6192354999869475 To the Earth, of course. My father's burden is my burden… Whatever it may be.
6192354999869476 To burn him is to release him to Sky. An old, lowly rite. A rite for the impure, unkind, disloyal… in times past. Now, they often burn paupers. Not a dishonorable rite.\nTo give him to Earth is better. The wise say: "Earth returns our dead to us as kind boons." What choose you?
6192354999869477 It's hardly a choice. I honor my father.
6192354999869478 How can I take such an obligation upon myself? What if I fail to meet it?
6192354999869479 Then go, and tell them so.
6192354999869480 I will.
6192354999869481 Wait for me here.
6192354999869482 The wise say: "Who can part the fog of time?" "What if" is a weakness.
6192354999869483 Very well. I've made up my mind.
6192354999869484 Then I am weak. I don't want this burden.
6192354999869485 You are a brave man, emshen. A true son to your father. I rejoice as I watch you. The Khatanghe—the Kin—shed tears of pride and delight as they watch you.
6192354999869486 I'm afraid.
6192354999869487 Thank you, khetey.
6192354999869488 What is fate, emshen? The wise say: "A fate is like a good wife; no one can make you take one, but it is a boon to have one, as long as your love is sincere."\nBut you are a free man. You make your own choices. Your father appreciated freedom.
6192354999869489 Freedom has a steep price.
6192354999869490 I don't want to follow along on his trail. I'll find my own.
6192354999869491 "Khetey" means "sister-elder." Is that what you mean to call me? Bayarlaa, thank you. You still remember something of your people's ways?
6192354999869492 Yes.
6192354999869493 I remember… very little.
6192354999869494 We shall bear your burden together, emshen. Your father helped me; I helped him. I shall help you, too. In you, I see him.
6192354999869495 Don't. I'll bear my burdens alone.
6192354999869496 I always act first and think later, ekhene. Got the scars to prove it.
6192354999869497 Your father was a wise man. But he wasted not his time on doubting. He acted instead of brooding. That's why his works were great, and many…\nHe who lives cautiously, pacing circles in his own head, spares himself, but wastes those he loves… and those who love him.
6192354999869498 Very well. Consider me comforted.
6192354999869499 I did the right thing. That is what my heart tells me.
6192354999869500 Follow me, emshen. You are now to come into your legacy.
6192354999869501 Okay.
6192354999869502 To you, she might have been kind. Warming your bed, stoking your hearth, bearing your children. But a stranger, she might hate and torment. Whoever claims her, will pay terribly. Heed this warning.
6192354999869503 Are you talking about yourself? Do you plan to claim my, uh, fate?
6192354999869505 Maybe, maybe.
6192354999869506 Guess I'll have to keep an eye on you, too.
6192354999869507 But we hardly know each other, Sahba.
6192354999869508 I leave you to your grief, now. Come to my home if you need me. I will wait for you, night and day. For as long as I remain, tangher, I will stand behind your shoulder.
6192354999869509 Let's go.
6192354999869510 I have devils enough on my shoulder. But… fine.
6192354999869511 Don't, Sahba. I want nothing to do with the Kin. I don't need you either.
6192354999869512 I am sorry about Isidor. But we have not the time to grieve. Here's what matters: You are now to take your father's legacy. <i>Take it,</i> mind. Not <i>come into it.</i>
6192354999869513 Pardon me, what?
6192354999869514 Maybe I don't even want to take it.
6192354999869515 What do you mean, we "have not the time"? I've got all the time in the world.
6192354999869516 You have ten days. Trust me—I foresee ten. Be khara, great troubles—a khayud—are upon us. Death already nests in four houses. Soon, it will crawl out upon the town—decimate it, then halve it. \nThe wise say: "The sky is falling; where will you hide when it pins you down?"
6192354999869517 What kind of khayud?
6192354999869518 Who are you, anyway?
6192354999869519 Here—I'm giving you his udhar, his "warm vessel." He gave it to me on the eve of his last holiday. Must have presaged the evil that would befall him.
6192354999869520 You're right, he must have. That's why he summoned me to the town…
6192354999869521 Why you?
6192354999869522 What do you mean by "warm vessel"?
6192354999869523 I know not. But be it war, rebellion, plague, or simple misfortune, who cares? You have greater things to worry about now.
6192354999869524 Like what?
6192354999869525 Is this another premonition? Or do you know for sure?
6192354999869526 You are an odd one, emshen. You were brought up here, yet came of age far away. Neither fish, nor fowl… Well, let us hope that your blood calls to you.\nAn udhar is a vessel where a man keeps all that is important to him. The things that… how do you say "gyur"? Things that preserve his essence. You will, someday, make one of your own.
6192354999869527 I'm not fond of material possessions.
6192354999869528 Ah… Yes, I seem to recall that idea.
6192354999869529 I am Sahba Usp'tae. I sense the will of Earth. Your father made me. Named me. Trusted me.
6192354999869530 Very well. So…?
6192354999869531 I suppose I will trust you, too.
6192354999869532 I'm giving you his udkhar. It's yours, now. As are the things inside. Now, the money… It's a light purse, isn't it? Your father didn't care much for money.
6192354999869533 Okay. You said I would "take" my legacy, but not "come into it." What did you mean by that?
6192354999869534 Listen, khetey, I don't want it. I refused his obligations, so it would be unfitting for me to accept his belongings.
6192354999869535 Is this pride I hear from you? Still your blood, emshen. Whatever he owed, it is not the same as what he owned. There's no need for a tantrum, and you know not what comes next… Perhaps you will change your mind.
6192354999869536 Why would I?
6192354999869537 To take someone's obligations, word is not enough. To come into a legacy, taking the <i>things</i> is not enough. Your father's bequeathal is more than merely material.
6192354999869538 Yes, I gathered as much. But what do I need to do?
6192354999869539 What else, then?
6192354999869540 His fate. His place… in the Kin. In our hearts. And in our follies.
6192354999869541 That is exactly what I <i>don't</i> want to take on.
6192354999869542 I can't replace him.
6192354999869543 I see.
6192354999869544 There is now emptiness where he once was. Who is to fill it? Who will heal the sick? Tell truth from lies? Who will… "kharaa," who will plumb the depths?\nOnly a menkhu can cut a body. Only a menkhu can pierce the unknown. Who will draw the Lines?
6192354999869545 I don't care about any of that. I only want to find my father's killer.
6192354999869546 All this menkhu talk is just a relic of a bygone age. Father was fond of it, yes. But the Kin are extinct.
6192354999869547 The "wise" say it, yes? I knew it would come down to more old wives' tales.
6192354999869548 You are wrong. Look at the items I'm giving you.\nOpen the udkhar and touch those items.
6192354999869549 …
6192354999869577 Do any of these items seem familiar?
6192354999869578 What are they…? Swevery, various kinds of twyre… Herbs. Why would he leave me herbs?
6192354999869579 He used to make herbal medicine. Tinctures to cure any malady…\nHe was a menkhu. A knower of connections. He saw which things sing in unison when joined. That's what the Lines are—even if you say you need not this knowledge… emshen.
6192354999869580 And what about this list of names?
6192354999869582 You speak differently. More like a normal townsperson. I thought you were one of the Kin?
6192354999869583 Closer, let my tired eyes see it… The names of local children… Khan is what they call the Kain boy. Capella is the daughter of the Master, may he choke on his name. But I know not why Isidor listed them.
6192354999869584 Perhaps my father looked after them?
6192354999869585 I know some of these children already.
6192354999869586 Hm… He did pay much attention to these children. Spent most of his final days with them. They followed him, like calves that trailed after a cow, or oxen pulled by a yoke.
6192354999869587 His last days, you say… Wait. That's a lead I can follow!
6192354999869588 Okay. How about this sigil here?
6192354999869589 Which ones?
6192354999869590 Notkin leads a gang that keeps invisible pets. Mature for his age.
6192354999869591 Murky's an orphan. She lives by the railroad.
6192354999869592 Grace takes care of the cemetery.
6192354999869593 Olgimskaya is indeed Fat Vlad's daughter. She doesn't take after her father, though.
6192354999869594 Sticky's an urchin. I think he's my very own squatter, now.
6192354999869597 You think one of them has something to do with his death? Doubtful… They're still just children. Then again, children hold so much power in this town that it wouldn't surprise me…\nBut they loved him, they did. No, I believe it not.
6192354999869598 I can also see something else on that list... an eighth item. Some sort of sigil. Does it also refer to a child?
6192354999869600 This is a brand for marking bulls. But brands of the Kin often have specific meanings. \nBe khara, this one is "udurgh." Tough to parse… It means something like "a big body," or "a special body." "A body that contains a lot." But I'm not sure. It may be just a sigil.
6192354999869601 Who could interpret this for me?
6192354999869602 Bayarlaa, Sahba. I have now come into my legacy.
6192354999869603 I am your father not, kholboön. I can instruct you not. You are to learn on your own. Speak to people. Most of all, speak to those who knew your father well.\nThat is how you may come into your legacy.
6192354999869604 What do you mean?
6192354999869605 Are you, once again, hinting that I am to follow in my father's footsteps? I will not. I make my own fate.
6192354999869606 In this place, you must come into your legacy through action, not mere words. By showing you understand the contents of the vessel. Follow your father's trails. Learn who he was. Find yourself a fate.\nA fate like a good wife, emshen. Your wife.
6192354999869607 Sounds good, but…
6192354999869608 I choose to walk my own trails, khetey.
6192354999869609 …You are to come into your inheritance, emshen. I change for you; take root on your path. Khaya dee, thank you for this.
6192354999869610 Thank <i>you.</i> Anyway, who are the people listed on the piece of paper?
6192354999869611 Follow his trails, emshen. Then you will know what kind of man he was. And what kind of man you are to become.
6192354999869612 Do you know what kind of man he was?
6192354999869613 Let me start with you. What can you tell me about him?
6192354999869614 Your father was a menkhu. He was respected for it.
6192354999869615 A "menkhu"?
6192354999869616 He was respected because he was a doctor.
6192354999869617 He knew the Lines.
6192354999869618 What Lines?
6192354999869619 Lines, that's just a philosophy. Like the Tao, or phenomenology…
6192354999869620 What's a "tao"?
6192354999869621 Never mind. What are the Lines, in your interpretation?
6192354999869622 Lines represent the paths between things. The links that connect them. The laws that govern our lives.\nBetween evil Sky and kind Earth is a Line. The veins of our lifeblood are Lines. A Line carries the inevitable retribution for evil deeds. Family ties, the way children reflect their parents… Those are Lines, too.
6192354999869623 Father used to say that Lines referred to anatomy.
6192354999869624 Everything is connected to everything else in some way, Sahba. Hence me pointing out this is a useless philosophy.
6192354999869625 Everything is connected? No son of Isidor would utter such drivel. It reaches my ears not! 
6192354999869626 Father was a doctor, not a philosopher. He knew how to heal.
6192354999869627 That, as well. He knew how a body is composed because he knew the Lines. He knew how a kidney links to an herb, so he could brew a curative tea from it. He knew how one herb linked to another. He knew how to draw a knife to cut a body, but bring no harm.
6192354999869628 Yes. He did indeed know all of that.
6192354999869629 I see.
6192354999869630 More than that…
6192354999869631 What else, then?
6192354999869632 Fine. And also because he was a just and dutiful man.
6192354999869633 Hence me saying that you will only come into your legacy if you follow his trail. Do what he used to. All you Burakhs are alike… Men of action.\nI have told you all I know, emshen. Be on your way, now.
6192354999869634 Farewell, Sahba. And thank you… Bayarlaa. May your kine fatten.
6192354999869635 My head's spinning from all this… That's enough for a day.
6192354999869636 Now hear me well, emshen, for my next words are crucial. This first couple of days will be hardest for you. \nYou will find yourself surrounded by Lines innumerable. Some you must tear apart; others, follow; others still, cut yourself. Only thus will you reach the end.
6192354999869637 And I feel that end is nigh…
6192354999869638 I have taken your words to heart, khetey. Douse your eyes.
6192354999869639 Well, one thing is clear: You are a very, very lucky man. Which means you need to take care of yourself! You are so careless, Vorakh. It's Artemy Vorakh, right?
6192354999869640 Burakh. Artemy Burakh.
6192354999869641 And you are…?
6192354999869642 Daniil Dankovsky, Bachelor of Medicine, at your service. But before we speak any further, I'd like to clarify a rather crucial thing: Just how highly do you hold your sense of duty?
6192354999869643 Too highly, clearly, since it brought me back to this wretched town…
6192354999869644 Why do you ask?
6192354999869645 All Burakhs are guided by duty. It runs in the family.
6192354999869646 Daniil Dankovsky, Bachelor of Medicine. At your service.
6192354999869647 But where's Rubin? This place used to belong to a friend of mine.
6192354999869648 My dear fellow, Rubin is no friend of yours! Quite the opposite, actually. Any observer could deduce that your hypothetical meeting would have… little to no chance of ending well.
6192354999869649 What? Why?
6192354999869650 But he's not just a friend. He's my best friend.
6192354999869651 And what the hell are you doing here, buddy?
6192354999869652 Well, from this point on, you—ahem—<i>owe me.</i> I just saved you from a rather grisly fate!
6192354999869653 I don't remember seeing a rescue team.
6192354999869654 Perhaps I'll repay you in kind someday.
6192354999869655 Your Rubin has utterly murderous intents. Isidor meant quite a lot to him! Your father was his mentor. Rubin even considers himself old Burakh's true son… Unlike you. \nAnyway, he thinks you're to blame for your father's death.
6192354999869656 What a load of…!
6192354999869657 Wait… My father is dead?
6192354999869658 I managed to convince him that you didn't actually kill Isidor. Well, not empirically! \nBut I'm under the impression that, in Rubin's mind, you still caused your father's death. You did, after all, take your sweet time getting here… while Isidor was counting on your help. Is that true?
6192354999869659 …It is. I've thought about that myself.
6192354999869660 No, it's not. And I sense some foul play in your valiant attempt to save me from my best friend.
6192354999869661 Trying to guilt-trip me, huh? That's clever. What a learned man you are.
6192354999869662 Look, you have my condolences, Vorakh. But since we've established that you owe me, let me explain how you'll repay your debt. Things are about to get a little tense, and I need only one thing: Just do <i>exactly as I tell you.</i> \nYou're a doctor, right?
6192354999869663 Burakh. How are things going to get tense?
6192354999869664 I'm a surgeon. A good one, too.
6192354999869665 We haven't "established" that I owe you anything, buddy.
6192354999869666 Today's tragedy won't be the last. I was blessed with a naturally high intelligence, and my observations indicate that a very deadly visitor has come to this god-forsaken town. \nThat's all I can say for now.
6192354999869667 …I don't like you, Bachelor Whatever.
6192354999869668 Allow me to sum up. Rubin told me he's the only decent doctor in town, but you're a competent surgeon! I need you alive, healthy, and quiet. Close at hand. \nSpare me any wild improvisations—I'll be the one handling the situation. Medicum morbo adhibere.
6192354999869669 How about you just shut up? I'll deal with Rubin myself. No middlemen required. Where is he?
6192354999869670 I always sucked at this stupid language. I'll assume that was an apology.
6192354999869671 I need to see if you're any good first. For now, cheers.
6192354999869672 Qui habet aures, audiat… As the saying goes.
6192354999869673 …I don't like you, Bachelor Whatever.
6192354999869674 Amaa tat, khonzohon, as goes the local one.
6192354999869675 Oh, he was killed tonight. Didn't you know?
6192354999869676 No…
6192354999869677 Liar! Everything you've said is a lie!
6192354999869678 Oh, I doubt it. I'm much more cautious than you. And attentive. And heedful. For example, I've managed to establish a friendly relationship with Rubin, your so-called friend.
6192354999869679 But Rubin <i>is</i> my friend.
6192354999869680 And was that hard?
6192354999869681 Gone to carry out my orders! From now on, your Rubin does what I tell him to do. He entered my service of his own accord. \nI suggest that you do the same. It will help everyone.
6192354999869682 I just hate big-city dandies who think they know best.
6192354999869683 Stubbornness is my guiding star, second only to my sense of duty. I suggest you put your high intelligence to good use and get out of my way, Bachelor.
6192354999869684 Apologies. Oh, and may I ask… Is it true that your actions have already resulted in four deaths?
6192354999869685 I'm not in the habit of spilling my guts to strangers. Especially when they can't even remember my name.
6192354999869686 Three.
6192354999869688 Are you a detective?
6192354999869689 That's what I thought.
6192354999869690 And who the hell are you, buddy?
6192354999869691 Back so soon, Burakh? I hope there's a good reason.
6192354999869692 The kids outside told me that three of their friends are at death's door… and you refused to help.
6192354999869693 My dear fellow, that sounds like your area of expertise. You're welcome to offer them your services! I have better things to do than waste my time on a bunch of mangy mutts.
6192354999869694 "Better things to do"? You took the oath—now do your duty!
6192354999869695 "Mutts," huh? Well, now I know where you stand. I'd break your jaw, buddy, if my hand didn't hurt so much…
6192354999869696 You have a kind heart, Burakh.
6192354999869697 No, but I do have <i>a</i> heart, at least.
6192354999869698 Leave this town, Bachelor. We were better off without you.
6192354999869699 My duty is quite different. And if you keep wasting my time, I might fail to perform it.
6192354999869700 I'm not wasting your time!
6192354999869701 We have a very different idea of what duty is.
6192354999869702 Why are you here?
6192354999869703 Wrong question. Why are <i>you</i> here?
6192354999869704 I live here.
6192354999869705 Do you really want to know?
6192354999869706 Unfortunately, this house is sealed off. I'm sorry, Burakh… It <i>is</i> Burakh, isn't it?
6192354999869707 Let me guess. You were the one who sealed it off?
6192354999869708 Quite.
6192354999869709 Well, I come bearing a sanitary order. So I'm here to examine and quarantine the place.
6192354999869710 You won't like it in there.
6192354999869711 Hospitality is an important tradition in my family. But to you, I'll deny it.
6192354999869712 I'd prefer to, yes.
6192354999869713 I was examining the scene of my father's death.
6192354999869714 This is my house.
6192354999869715 Just wanted to make sure nobody was… nosing around the place.
6192354999869716 Why?
6192354999869717 I don't like you, Bachelor Whatever.
6192354999869718 This just isn't the right moment for it.
6192354999869719 Daniil Dankovsky, at your service.
6192354999869720 Just get lost.
6192354999869721 Wrong. This is the critical moment. I would actually go so far as to say that this house needs to be locked down immediately. Every minute counts.
6192354999869722 Bullshit.
6192354999869723 Really? Why?
6192354999869724 It's a bit untidy.
6192354999869725 The air inside is… unhealthy, somehow. It might irritate your tender skin.
6192354999869726 Something's wrong in there.
6192354999869727 Because this is my house, and I'm not letting you in.
6192354999869728 Is that so? Still, with your kind permission, I insist on examining the place. \nEven your unkind permission would do. But if you struggle to provide even that, I'll do fine without your consent at all. I hope I don't need to threaten you at gunpoint?
6192354999869729 To hell with you. Do whatever you want.
6192354999869730 I warned you.
6192354999869731 Go ahead, then. Examine the place. And if you can explain what's going on here, be so kind as to tell me, too.
6192354999869732 Yes, I bear the unfortunate burden of this responsibility. But lighten up! This is all for the best.
6192354999869733 Where is my father's body?
6192354999869734 "For the best"? <i>For the—</i>well, up yours! This is <i>my</i> house, you insufferable fop, and—
6192354999869735 I don't have that information.
6192354999869736 …So where do I go now?
6192354999869737 —and yet, for the reasons that I cannot currently disclose to you, the house is still under a temporary quarantine.
6192354999869738 …So where do I go now?
6192354999869739 Well, take a look at these. I found some papers inside, and a key. I suppose they belong to you now. Hopefully the papers can explain what the key unlocks.
6192354999869740 That's something, I guess.
6192354999869741 I could definitely use a roof over my head…
6192354999869801 Well, look who's entered my humble home! Could that be my pal Artemy the Artist? The Artemy who cuts arteries, maybe?\nNo… I don't recognize this man. Too soft. They must have kept him swaddled an' coddled, whatever palace he ran off for.
6192354999869802 "Palace"? I left for school.
6192354999869803 Knew you'd end up like this.
6192354999869804 Good to see you, too.
6192354999869805 Climbin' the ladder, then?
6192354999869806 If only.
6192354999869807 Not the same one you're on.
6192354999869808 End? The end comes when your limbs don't bend, ha, an' I'm still nimble, friend. Y'know who folks want to end? You.
6192354999869809 How come?
6192354999869810 A li'l bird told me you're a hard-boiled criminal now. I'll admit, old friend, I got misty-eyed with pride. Lucky for you, I can store you anywhere in the Warehouses, an' no quail nor nightingale would sing a tune.
6192354999869811 You're a storekeeper?
6192354999869812 I'm not some product.
6192354999869813 It was self-defense.
6192354999869814 Not a keeper of stores, but stories. This town, this great machine, the gears don't turn on their own, no, not till they're slick with secrets.
6192354999869815 Verbose nonsense. I know what you do.
6192354999869816 Fine. Your business, not mine.
6192354999869817 You're no fun. Aren't you happy to see an old friend?
6192354999869818 You've become… important.
6192354999869819 Oddly enough, I am.
6192354999869820 Just say what you mean, Artemy, an' call me a thief. Y'know, we'll all reap what we sow. Do you honestly resent me? …In truth, I work for Fat Vlad. Keepin' tabs on the Warehouses.
6192354999869821 Gathered that much. You're a storekeeper, then?
6192354999869822 Forget it. Tell me this, friend. What's your plan?
6192354999869823 My plan? …Why do you ask like that?
6192354999869824 Do you know about my father's murder?
6192354999869825 Odd indeed. Why so cheery?
6192354999869826 You're going to help me. You know about my father's death, don't you?
6192354999869827 This place brings back memories.
6192354999869828 I do. May he rest in peace. He was a decent man, an' the best sawbones around.
6192354999869829 You honor him.
6192354999869830 Do you know who murdered him?
6192354999869831 …Cub, your old man got killed. This night. You haven't heard?
6192354999869832 What? You're lying!
6192354999869833 I have.
6192354999869834 What's the plan, then? Revenge? Or somethin' with a li'l more finesse?
6192354999869835 Revenge.
6192354999869836 I'll find out who's behind this. Then, we'll see.
6192354999869837 Nope. Sniffin' the ground ourselves. You didn't think it was one of mine? Listen, we don't cut folks. We honor tradition.\nAlthough… there was one fella, Barley, he left our little community a month back, an' got himself a new one. Now, they do cut folks, but they wouldn't touch your old man. They aren't fools.
6192354999869838 I'll admit, I did suspect one of yours.
6192354999869839 Seems there must be at least one fool in town.
6192354999869840 Hell, Artemy! Half the town wants your head over this, those fools. Ah, easy to fix. Give me a li'l time.
6192354999869841 …I don't believe you.
6192354999869842 Go ahead, if you want.
6192354999869843 No. I'll fix this mess myself.
6192354999869844 Just stay away from Saburov. I mean it, Cub—the man's a hawk, all might makes right, no sense. He'll throw you in jail first an' only think months later…\nI know your thick skull, too! You'd charge in there, shoulders squared, thinking, oh, the truth will win out! Bullshit. <i>Stay away.</i> Y'hear me?
6192354999869845 Are you finished? Calm down!
6192354999869846 Mind your own skull, all right?
6192354999869847 You run into the old crowd? Stakh Rubin, Lara?
6192354999869848 Haven't seen them around.
6192354999869849 I've been to Rubin's. He's not home.
6192354999869850 I've seen Lara. She's… different.
6192354999869851 Gotta say, it's a tough time for our friendship—I mean, if you can even call this friendship.\nGravel-hearted Lara won't look at me now, an' Stakh's even worse. He completely ignored my plea for help!
6192354999869852 You need help?
6192354999869853 Some people certainly have short memories.
6192354999869854 You gone outside recently? It's chaos! Innocent souls torn limb from limb! Everyone's lost their minds hunting the culprit—a steppe golem, some think, but others? They're after <i>your</i> hide, friend.\nAll this going on, naturally, my men ran into a mob. Barely got out alive. They need a sawbones, bad. Your old man's gone, an' his star student Stakh won't take the job, so…
6192354999869855 People mistook your men for me? Each and every one of them?
6192354999869856 Something tells me your men weren't out there feeding the poor.
6192354999869857 Let me patch them up. I <i>am</i> a surgeon, after all. Are your men still here?
6192354999869858 Not here. Shiner dropped by, said they're waitin' for death in a hideout.\nPoor Piecework, he's knockin' on heaven's door. Got somethin' stuck in the belly. Can you believe folks? They're all shapeshifters, I swear, sheddin' skin an' eatin' each other. May not look it, but every person in this town has a vile beast inside.
6192354999869859 I need tools. Don't have any on me.
6192354999869860 Hell if I know! Can't make heads or tails of 'em now. If you squint, Piecework does kinda resemble you—a sturdy man. Perhaps he did take a few hits to the noggin in your stead. How do you feel about that?
6192354999869861 About guilt trips? I don't like them.
6192354999869862 I could look at Piecework. Where is he?
6192354999869863 Tools! Got you all set, friend. Blessed be the Warehouses, the wellspring of goods—including illegal ones. There! Take a peek inside that crate, an' choose anything your heart desires. \nAlthough… maybe you should stick around. Dangerous out.
6192354999869864 Knock it off. Not like I can stay here forever. I'll drop by the patient when I'm in the area.
6192354999869865 Fair enough.
6192354999869866 Wonderful. You find anything in his belly he doesn't need, don't toss it! Bring it to me. Might be useful.
6192354999869867 What, like a memento? …You're still a weird one. Bred in the bone, I suppose.
6192354999869868 Depends what I find. Might very well keep it myself.
6192354999869869 "Let us rest on the mountain, oh, let us rest by the river…" That's the song your people sing when times are hard, isn't it?\n…How's Piecework? I assume he kicked the bucket.
6192354999869870 …He meant nothing to you, then? Great.
6192354999869871 No, I patched Piecework back together.
6192354999869872 Cub, my friend! You didn't mess around in school, huh? An' to hell with Stakh, let him sulk. He only makes it worse for himself.
6192354999869873 So what's the plan now?
6192354999869874 Huh? Did he not say please an' thank you, or somethin'?
6192354999869875 Your man Piecework is trash. He got cut for burning a woman.
6192354999869876 …Oh. Folks have lost their minds, I'm tellin' you, an' Piecework's never been friends with his own head. What'd you do to him?
6192354999869877 I patched him up. You know why? I want to see what <i>you'll</i> do with him.
6192354999869878 He's dead, friend. You told me cut out anything he didn't need, so I cut it all out.
6192354999869879 …So you're a funny man, huh? A funny man. Gotta keep my eyes peeled around you. Great. Wonderful.
6192354999869880 So what's the plan now?
6192354999869881 You caught my drift, Grigory. You'll want to watch your back. See you around.
6192354999869882 The plan is to live. Live an' breathe, an' thieve, an' leave…\nWhat'd you find inside Piecework? Just curious.
6192354999869883 This. Your men are fond of shivs, huh? Even an incendiary bullet would be less cruel.
6192354999869884 Well, that's people for you. I'd been wondering what our kind townsfolk fashion those li'l barbs from. I see, I see… This explains who broke into Warehouse Eight, last week. The thread unravels… I'll make a note of this.\nIf you find more shivs, bring them to me. Don't give them to the kids, even if they offer bullets.
6192354999869885 Bullets?
6192354999869886 Kids?
6192354999869887 I know. I've been offered a good deal.
6192354999869888 Those kids have some nerve. Armed to the teeth, playin' at war. They carved off a nice slice of turf while you were gone.\nWon't be long till li'l Kain starts pushin' us around. Look, point is, they'll offer you loot they stole from me in exchange for pointy things. Premium items. Don't be a shit. Just come see me.
6192354999869889 Premium?
6192354999869890 I don't need premium. It's all contraband.
6192354999869891 I got myself a nice li'l business. You need weapons, or anythin' illegal, come see me. I'll let you peek below the counter. Nothing for free, of course.\nNo discounts, either. My men wouldn't respect that. Be glad I trust you enough to make any deals. So, what'll it be?
6192354999869892 I'll keep that in mind.
6192354999869893 You're too kind.
6192354999869894 Show me.
6192354999869895 An' here comes Artemy, Artemy of the Academy! What do you need?
6192354999869896 Any insight on what's going on around town?
6192354999869897 If you think I'm so out of place, I can leave.
6192354999869898 Oh, sure, I've got insight. Got everything in sight. Death has his hands full… Our grand leader Simon drew his last breath. \nWhat else do you want to know about? The bosses an' their schemes, or the rumor mill?
6192354999869899 The… bosses, sure. Tell me the balance of power.
6192354999869900 The rumor mill.
6192354999869901 Still the same. Saburov the hawk is in charge, but he's all squawk, ha. \nThe Kains, as usual, rack their brains on how to move the town downriver. Quacks, all. The Tower already floats! Mark my words, they'll hang the next district in the clouds. \nAs for the Master… well, he's the Master.
6192354999869902 You mean Fat Vlad?
6192354999869903 Sure do. He's sittin' pretty, the ugly bastard. Put me at the heart of the Warehouses. No complaints here. Quaint li'l abode, an' under my feet, a whole railroad. You don't bother Vlad an' he won't bother you, neither.
6192354999869904 He's a scumbag.
6192354999869905 He's a moneybag first an' foremost, friend. He runs this whole machine. Feeds the Town. Allows us to earn our keep. \nNot just me, but everyone here. How many folks work at the cannery? At the Station? The Warehouses alone house four hundred. An' everyone gets paid solid coin.
6192354999869906 Yeah, "coin." Just one. Barely enough to survive.
6192354999869907 And that's how he justifies all this exploitation…
6192354999869908 I guess.
6192354999869909 Guesswork will get you nowhere, friend. Leave Fats alone. He's on a roll, an' anyone not on his payroll will get stomped flat, ha.
6192354999869910 True.
6192354999869911 He wants <i>something</i> from me, but I have no idea what.
6192354999869912 You steppe people, all you know is herdin' cows an' pushin' plows. \nWe have to look to tomorrow, Cub. You think the Kains are interested in architecture for, what, its own sake? Even so, who will pay for it? Gotta think with your stomach some of the time. The Master is a shrewd man. Although, he did ban entrance to the Termitary… Of that, I wasn't a fan.
6192354999869913 What's going on with that?
6192354999869914 Folks there had problems with Fat Vlad, an' it almost turned violent. Makes sense, too! Five thousand animals are bound to turn into beasts. Your kind is like a pack of dogs, one howls an' the rest follow. But still…
6192354999869915 If I find out more, I'll be sure to tell you.
6192354999869916 "Pack of dogs"? Check a mirror. Your tongue's so loose it licks the ground.
6192354999869917 "Still is a step away from stiff." Isn't that one of your tiresome sayings?
6192354999869918 Let's see… Simon's dead, but you already knew that. The ground refused to accept your dad, you know that too. \nAn awful bachelor arrived from the Capital. Some odd girl arrived the same day as you, too. A curious one. Half sure she's some saint. Tore my soul out, hanged it out to dry…
6192354999869919 How did Simon die?
6192354999869920 What do you mean the ground "refused to accept" my dad?
6192354999869921 Who is this bachelor?
6192354999869922 Tell me more about the odd girl.
6192354999869923 …Wait. What about my father?
6192354999869924 No one knows. Felt feverish, I guess? \nYou notice he'd been joined at the hip with your dad? Glove an' hand. Always together, conspiring. Probably engineerin' a future for us stupid creatures.
6192354999869925 The Kains are still in charge, then?
6192354999869926 You even attend the funeral, Cub? Some familial bonds you have there. \nWhatever. Guess they managed without you. Burned him, since the ground wouldn't take the flesh. Your people weren't so pleased about that.
6192354999869927 Let's change the subject. What about the rest of town?
6192354999869928 Grabbed himself a nice slice of pie immediately. A learned man. A celebrity. Everyone's fighting tooth an' nail for the right to be scolded by him. The Kains even invited him to be their next door neighbor.
6192354999869929 The Kains are still in charge, then?
6192354999869930 Just something about her. You know me, I've got a keen intuition. Wouldn't have made it this far otherwise. I feel she's… not entirely human, even. The Saburovs took her in.
6192354999869931 Apart from the Saburovs, who else holds power now?
6192354999869932 Shouldn't you be at the cemetery? They've been tryin' to bury him since dawn. Tryin' an' failin'.
6192354999869933 Damn it! Why am I wasting my time with you, then?
6192354999869934 Checkin' out the wares?
6192354999869936 Nah. Just your smug mug.
6192354999869937 That familiar old face… You know, I remember what your esteemed father looked like… when he was young. I am, after all, only fifteen years younger. \nHe was a very decent person… He had a real spine.
6192354999869938 Boös Vlad. I'm honored.
6192354999869939 What do you want from me?
6192354999869940 What do you mean, "he was"? He's in still in town, right?
6192354999869941 Welcome home, my dear boy… welcome home. The reception was rather… lukewarm, though? Wasn't it?
6192354999869942 It was.
6192354999869943 It's fine. I expected this.
6192354999869944 Come, now… I don't want anything. You are the one with wants, and I suppose I'll learn them soon.
6192354999869945 Then why did you summon me?
6192354999869946 I'm just dropping by for old times' sake. I don't have anything better to do.
6192354999869947 I'm getting reports you're a villain, my boy… a murderous villain. My people are upset that they couldn't do you in. They're an ugly mob, aren't they? So small-minded. Animals… beasts… swine. At least you slipped away. \nPerhaps I should… stand up for you?
6192354999869948 That would be useful. Can you really?
6192354999869949 I don't need help. I've already dealt with the whole mess—well, partially.
6192354999869950 They are a mob, sure. But they're not swine.
6192354999869951 Now that's more like it! An independent lad… just like your father. He despised patronage too. Always by himself… wouldn't even take my advice. Wouldn't bow to anyone… \nShame. A supple backbone can be useful… It can improve the situation for everyone.
6192354999869952 What are you talking about?
6192354999869953 Do you know who killed him?
6192354999869954 You don't think they're beasts? Heh heh!
6192354999869955 You've treated this town's commonfolk like cattle for years. Do you expect me to just take your side?
6192354999869956 They aren't.
6192354999869957 There's a beast hidden in each of us. You too, boös.
6192354999869958 My power is immense, boy. Have you forgotten? Everything you see here is mine! The whole Bull Enterprise… the Abattoir, the Factory, the Warehouses, the Station… This town's veins are my reins. Its meat and bones, my throne! \nI am the Master… and I expect to be obeyed.
6192354999869959 You don't own me, boös.
6192354999869960 And everyone really obeys you?
6192354999869961 I haven't forgotten, boös, believe me. And I'm not the only one who remembers.
6192354999869962 Not you, that much I know. But we'll find out… soon enough. Soon enough.
6192354999869963 So why did you summon me?
6192354999869964 Are you running an investigation, then?
6192354999869965 He was… murdered. Tonight. My condolences… You didn't know?
6192354999869966 Murdered?! Who killed him?
6192354999869967 At least… take my advice. I'm always eager to help Isidor's son. \nStay here a while… Don't go out. My house is big, plenty of space. If you need anything, just call the servants.
6192354999869968 Why should I do that?
6192354999869969 Thanks. I'll consider it.
6192354999869970 No. I won't be caged.
6192354999869971 Like they have a choice! I pulled a few strings already. A word or two about you, my boy… and your esteemed father. The web is moving as we speak. \nThe servants pass the word to the higher-ups… and the higher-ups talk to the lower-downs… the lower-downs, they calm the mob. And the mob… the mob will eventually get its hands on your father's killer.
6192354999869972 Well. Thanks for believing me.
6192354999869973 Finding the killer is my responsibility now.
6192354999869974 For your future's sake, my boy. What's the rush? Take a rest… You've suffered so much. And the rest of the Town… will have a rest from you.
6192354999869975 Thank you, boös. I'll sleep when I'm dead.
6192354999869976 I'll take care of my future myself.
6192354999869977 Stop running around, my boy… No need for you to leave. I won't chain you up, but believe me… Out there, you'll just make a mess.
6192354999869978 Where's my father? I need… I need to see his body.
6192354999869979 Chain? You think you could lock me up?
6192354999869980 I could, my boy… I could easily.
6192354999869981 I'm on urgent business. I need to pay last respects to my father.
6192354999869982 What am I supposed to do, then? Sit on my hands?
6192354999869983 Well… he might have been put in the ground already. Your people never linger with the rites of death. They bury the deceased immediately… like a seed, yes? And if you take too long, a seed won't sprout.
6192354999869984 Where do they bury my people these days? In the new cemetery?
6192354999869985 That's true.
6192354999869986 Exactly, my boy… It will keep you alive.
6192354999869987 And meanwhile, my father is dead! Where is his body?
6192354999869988 There's no such thing as "your people" anymore. Yours, ours… We're all just people. What's passed is past, so we're all buried together. Your rites are still different, though… Your kind must be buried in the morning, yes?
6192354999869989 I need to go. Goodbye, boös.
6192354999869990 Yes.
6192354999869991 Father didn't think the past was in the past. And neither do I.
6192354999869992 Listen… are you planning to avenge your father?
6192354999869993 I need to find the murderer first.
6192354999869994 Why do you ask?
6192354999869995 Kain is eager to condemn someone. Saburov, to execute. I, however… I'll make sure we find the right person. Yes… the right one.
6192354999869996 The right one is the one who killed him. It's not that hard.
6192354999869997 This is my business, boös. Not yours.
6192354999869998 That's not your job.
6192354999869999 What the hell do you mean?
6192354999870000 You're a restless soul, Master Burakh. Or have you come around to my plan?
6192354999870001 I need to get into the Termitary.
6192354999870002 I'm not a calf to be corralled.
6192354999870003 What for… if I may ask?
6192354999870004 Personal reasons.
6192354999870005 There's a girl in there I want to meet.
6192354999870006 There's no need for you to visit the Termitary, my boy… no need at all. It's my domain… I know what I'm talking about.
6192354999870007 What's going on in there?
6192354999870008 Well, whatever.
6192354999870009 Do you, by any chance… mean Overseer Tycheek's daughter?
6192354999870010 Yes.
6192354999870011 No. I'm talking about a completely different girl.
6192354999870012 Small wonder. Tycheek's daughter is adored there… worshipped, even. Catered to, and taken care of… without you. She'll be fine. Worry not.
6192354999870013 And yet, I would like to have permission to enter.
6192354999870014 Thanks, boös. That's reassuring.
6192354999870015 Should I worry, though? What's going on in there?
6192354999870016 The rabble rebels, my boy… the rabble rebels. Working people are… easily roused. Quick to abandon their humanity, and turn into rabid beasts… for that's what they are. \nIt's fine, though… They'll come around. But as long as they're rowdy, I keep them locked tight. It will boil over… This is not the first time.
6192354999870017 They wouldn't rebel if they didn't have a reason to.
6192354999870018 Perhaps it's time you started paying them?
6192354999870019 Don't tell me how to run my business, my boy. I… like you. For now. Don't show me your teeth, and I won't have to show you mine.
6192354999870020 Yours are sharp, I know that.
6192354999870021 I don't work for you, boös.
6192354999870022 Got any idea where she keeps bread? The shelves are empty.
6192354999870023 Who are you?
6192354999870024 Hi, thief.
6192354999870025 A close friend or a bitter enemy. Your choice, really. So—friends?
6192354999870026 What do you want?
6192354999870027 No. There's a sinister look in your eyes.
6192354999870028 Do you believe in divination, Burakh?
6192354999870029 No, I don't.
6192354999870030 Of course. Can you see my future?
6192354999870031 Well, that makes things harder. Because you're going to do something awful, and I could have saved you the disgrace.\nBut I guess you'd rather stay gloomy, self-centered, and bull-headed… Am I right?
6192354999870032 …I'm going to disgrace myself?
6192354999870033 Picture perfect.
6192354999870034 You'll spill a ton of blood, Burakh. Tremendous amounts. A river of blood. Family blood. Beloved blood. You will drown this town in blood, and soon. Unless you trust me.
6192354999870035 So, a bite of toast and you'll wave your hands and fix everything? Or do you take coin?
6192354999870036 I don't understand.
6192354999870037 Listen to me. You need to leave town. Now. If you must stay—lay low, do nothing. The less you do, the less grief you'll bring to those around you. \nAbandon your schemes. I'll handle it on my own. It'll be glorious. You'll see.
6192354999870038 …What are you going to do?
6192354999870039 You're good at chin music, I'll give you that. But your actual words are bullshit.
6192354999870040 Whatever it takes. It's all going to hell, and soon… We're halfway there now. \nJust stay still. Trust me, will you? I'm your sister. Your double. And I know what must be done. I know a great deal, Burakh. The future is open to me.
6192354999870041 Prove it.
6192354999870042 Your life lessons will prove me right. But heed my words: Whenever you want to do something, don't. You'll just make it worse. You'll be the demise of your hometown. You'll drown it with blood.
6192354999870043 Not buying it. And I think you should get going. The mistress of the house is getting anxious.
6192354999870044 Listen up, because I'll only say this once. If I ever catch you here again, I might get angry. And if you cross me, it'll be your blood that begins this. How's that for prophecy?
6192354999870045 I'll think about it.
6192354999870046 Says a ripper.
6192354999870047 Sort of. I'm a surgeon.
6192354999870048 How am I a ripper?
6192354999870049 I have many faces. Perhaps this one is sinister, yes. But that's 'cause you're the villain. I'm only a mirror.
6192354999870050 I'm no hero, but I'm not a villain. Much less <i>the</i> villain.
6192354999870051 Well, what can I see in you, mirror, mirror on the wall?
6192354999870052 I can.
6192354999870053 Go ahead, then!
6192354999870054 It's simple, idiot. Whatever you wanted to do, don't. Drop your plans. You aren't bringing your father back. Saving lives is my business.
6192354999870055 No, it's mine. I'm a doctor.
6192354999870056 Fine. Let's go. I'll introduce you to this house's owner. She's convinced there's a rat running around.
6192354999870057 As am I. A better one than you.
6192354999870058 Are you going to leave or do I need to throw you out?
6192354999870059 Want to bet?
6192354999870060 Have you thought about what I told you?
6192354999870061 I had the strangest dream. Was it your doing?
6192354999870062 I'm not that fast a thinker.
6192354999870063 I did. My answer's no.
6192354999870064 No. Yours.
6192354999870065 Don't you want to know what I dreamed of?
6192354999870066 Ugh… What's wrong with me? It's just a bad dream.
6192354999870067 Of horror, I'm sure. All dreams are prophetic. And since <i>you</i> dreamed it, you must have seen yourself spill blood. As for the details, spare me. My nerves are delicate.
6192354999870068 I'm not some monster, myself… Are you sure it was prophetic?
6192354999870069 So you know how to hypnotize people, then?
6192354999870070 It was prophetic. No doubt about that.
6192354999870071 I'm a steppe man, and we believe in fate. You can't run from fate.
6192354999870072 Nothing's doubtless.
6192354999870073 So you say you have a gift, huh? Well, I do too. I can sense when I'm being lied to. Like right now.
6192354999870074 …Hypno-what? What does that mean? But I can do many things. It's not about what I can do, though: It's about what I'm telling you. Heed my warning, Burakh. Leave this place.\nYour dreams will grow lighter when you do. Or maybe go enlist. War could always use a person like you.
6192354999870075 My war is here.
6192354999870076 Maybe I will.
6192354999870077 You know why the earth won't take him?
6192354999870078 I'm all ears.
6192354999870079 Who?
6192354999870080 Begone, wraith. You're just an illusion.
6192354999870081 Your father. Earth expels him like a foreign body. See that girl, Grace? The caretaker? She's getting desperate. I think she'd take his place in the grave if she could.
6192354999870082 Do you even understand what you're rambling about, you awful creature?
6192354999870083 What? This girl's the caretaker?
6192354999870084 Some people are weavers. They make connections. Others are cutters. They rip things apart. \nYour father, he was a cutter. You Burakhs are permitted to, aren't you? You're important among the locals. Privileged. As a faithful surgeon, he would cut apart a living, breathing town. Or even tear it to shreds with his hands alone. A violent man.
6192354999870085 How do you even know? You've only been here a few days.
6192354999870086 I think you'd better shut your mouth now, or I'll be the one tearing you to shreds.
6192354999870087 But I do. Because I know people and I know how to listen to them. I know how to connect. But your father was a cutter. He demolished the whole mycelium.
6192354999870088 Mycelium? What does that have to do with anything?
6192354999870089 Leave my father out of this.
6192354999870090 A human mycelium. The mycelium of the Town. He believed it was all intergrown wrong. \nThat's just like you surgeons… If a fracture fuses wrong, you just break it again, and sever the tissue too! Who does that? I'd do it all differently.
6192354999870091 Go ahead then. It's not like I'm stopping you.
6192354999870092 So you're no surgeon, then?
6192354999870093 I'm not. I don't work with bones and meat. My expertise has to do with more delicate things. Souls. Feelings. You wouldn't understand.
6192354999870094 Right. How would I?
6192354999870095 I don't believe in the supernatural.
6192354999870096 Uh huh.
6192354999870097 So she's the one I need to speak to.
6192354999870098 I see. You were talking about my father?
6192354999870099 You know why walk all hunched? That's because you're carrying on your shoulders the burden of all the evils you are about to commit.
6192354999870100 And who might you be?
6192354999870101 
6192354999870102 Either your best friend or your worst enemy. Depends on you. So, friends?
6192354999870103 What do you want?
6192354999870104 No. I don't like you, girl. You have a sinister look in your eyes.
6192354999870105 Do you believe in fortune-telling, Burakh?
6192354999870106 No, I don't.
6192354999870107 Obviously. Can you read fortune?
6192354999870108 
6192354999870109 Ugh... That complicates things. 'Cause you're about to do something horrible, and I could have spared you the disgrace.\nYou must be a gloomy, self-absorbed, bull-headed man... amd I right?
6192354999870110 So what is the disgraceful thing that I'm about to do?
6192354999870111 Spot on. It's like you're reading my mind.
6192354999870112 You will spill a lot of blood, Burakh. An awful lot of it. A river of blood. Dear blood. Beloved blood. You will literally drown your hometown in blood, and soon. Unless you trust me.
6192354999870113 So... A cracker or two and you'll magically fix everything, right? Or do you accept coin?
6192354999870114 What is this supposed to mean?
6192354999870115 Enough. I get the gist. Let's assume we're well acquainted.
6192354999870116 Listen here. Leave the town right now. And if you insist on staying, just lay low and don't do anything. The less you do, the less grief you'll bring to the people around you. Abandon your plans. I'll do everything myself. It'll be great, you'll see.
6192354999870117 ...You'll do what?
6192354999870118 Well, you're good at making chin music, I'll grant you that. But what you're saying is bullshit.
6192354999870119 What it takes. It will all go to hell soon... it's on its way already. Just stay put. Trust me, 'kay? I'm your sister. Your counterpart. And I know what must be done. I know a lot, Burakh. The future is an open book to me.
6192354999870120 Prove it.
6192354999870121 Life will be my proof. Just remember: whenever you feel like doing something, don't. You will only make things worse. You will be the demise of your hometown. You will drown it in blood.
6192354999870122 Not convinced. And I think it's time you took your leave.
6192354999870123 So this is how it's going to be: if I see you again, I might just get angry. And if you get in my way, it'll be your blood that everything starts with. Seeing how it's been foretold and everything.
6192354999870124 I'll consider it.
6192354999870125 Says the ripper.
6192354999870126 Of a kind. I'm a surgeon.
6192354999870127 Ripper? How am I a ripper?
6192354999870128 I have a lot of looks. This one may be sinister, yes. That's 'cause you're the villain. I am but a mirror.
6192354999870129 I may not be the best person in the world, but I'm not a villain, much less THE villain.
6192354999870130 Well... So what say you, mirror mirror on the wall?
6192354999870131 I can.
6192354999870132 Shoot!
6192354999870133 It's supposed to mean this. Whatever you were planning to do, don't. Cancel your plans. You won't bring your father back. And saving lives is my business.
6192354999870134 No, it's mine. I'm a doctor.
6192354999870135 All right, whatever. Let's go, I'll introduce you to the owner of the house. She's been wondering if there was a rat upstairs.
6192354999870136 So am I. And a better one than you.
6192354999870137 
6192354999870138 Want to bet?
6192354999870168 Useless. Pointless. Smartass will be the end of him. So will you. Poor Patches…
6192354999870169 You can have a go at him too, if you like.
6192354999870170 Smartass?
6192354999870171 …Notkin wouldn't let me.
6192354999870172 I wonder why…
6192354999870173 Why, I wonder?
6192354999870174 The Bachelor. The learned goon. Self-absorbed, self-assured… and a total unbeliever. People like him do the most harm.
6192354999870175 Why are you even here?
6192354999870176 I just wanted to help.
6192354999870177 Why didn't you, then?
6192354999870178 They don't believe in me. They don't believe I'm a miracle worker… As they have believed, so shall it be done for them. But then why should the boy suffer?
6192354999870179 He shouldn't.
6192354999870180 I'll deal with him myself. Maybe something will come of it.
6192354999870181 I wouldn't trust you with my life, either.
6192354999870182 How about you just… don't? You'll only make it worse. Doctor Smartass would smother him with medicine. You… what'll you do, cut his heart out? Ripper…
6192354999870183 No. I have another idea.
6192354999870184 I'll do it my father's way. He could cure without cutting.
6192354999870185 I'd rather cut out yours. I'm curious about it.
6192354999870190 Your face seems vaguely familiar, but I'm positive we've never met before. What is your business?
6192354999870191 I'm the son of Isidor Burakh. My name is Artemy.
6192354999870192 I'm not here on business.
6192354999870193 You have my condolences. And my envy.
6192354999870194 Envy? Why?
6192354999870195 That, my good man, is hard to believe. Every resident of this town has some sort of business with me. It's what I do. The Bull Enterprise is more than just plants, warehouses, abattoirs, and freight stations—it's built of my esteemed father's ambitions. \nMy guess is that he somehow managed to step on your toes. Am I correct?
6192354999870196 No, it's my father who used to do business with your family. I, on the other hand, know very little about you.
6192354999870197 So you're Vlad Olgimsky's son.
6192354999870198 You were lucky to have a father like him.
6192354999870199 Indeed.
6192354999870200 You think so?
6192354999870201 And who might your father be?
6192354999870202 Isidor Burakh.
6192354999870203 Not only that, but I'm a "Vlad Olgimsky" in my own right. And who do I have the pleasure of talking to?
6192354999870204 I'm Artemy Burakh.
6192354999870205 Isidor respected you as a person. He indulged your desire to walk your own path, and has never forced you to follow in his footsteps. Never tried to produce a carbon copy of himself.
6192354999870206 How can you know that?
6192354999870207 That bit about my "own path"? I'm afraid it's not so simple.
6192354999870208 When he sent you away, the Kin were livid. They condemned Isidor for tearing you away from your roots. \nBut he always said that this was the only way for you to come to truly love your people—through choice, not blind necessity. I see great love and wisdom in that.
6192354999870209 You seem to be well-informed.
6192354999870210 I get the feeling you're venting about your life, not discussing mine.
6192354999870211 My position in the family forces me to keep tabs on everything that happens in our sad little town.
6192354999870212 You don't seem to happy with that.
6192354999870213 Right you are. Familial obligation is a sore spot for me. I'd pay good money to never have to think about it again.
6192354999870214 I can relate.
6192354999870215 To me, it's a very important principle.
6192354999870216 With a father like yours, I don't see how you could say otherwise.
6192354999870217 Your father is the most influential person in the Town.
6192354999870218 If we disregard the Kains and Saburovs, one could say my father controls this town as closely as he controls his fat, fat purse. Sadly, he's content with the current state of affairs, and sees no reason for things to change. His complacency will doom us all. \nThings are already in motion… but let us speak of something else.
6192354999870219 All right.
6192354999870220 You're right, though. The current power balance should be challenged. I'm saying this as a son of the Kin.
6192354999870221 Fancy a drink?
6192354999870224 To avoid any miscommunication here, I'll be blunt. It was a small secret of ours. If my father finds out… Let's just say I'll be in trouble.\nI guess this cellar is now yours by inheritance, isn't it?
6192354999870225 Obviously.
6192354999870226 Answer the question, please.
6192354999870227 My dear Artemy… I appreciate that you're a straightforward man, so I'll be honest with you. \nYour people—or rather, what's left of them—that whole community called "the Kin"? They all but <i>belong</i> to my family. To my father, the Kin are a commodity: the workforce for the Bull Enterprise.
6192354999870228 Father told me it's more like slavery.
6192354999870229 Yes, and it's no laughing matter.
6192354999870230 Oh, I quite agree. Well, you should know that I don't condone my esteemed father's methods. And I <i>will</i> rule the Bull Enterprise one day.\nAs an insightful and assiduous owner, I would like to create a more productive and efficient foundation for our industrial empire. Do you understand?
6192354999870231 Not quite.
6192354999870232 I do.
6192354999870233 I would like to revive the Kin and its… dignity. I'm fond of your traditions. They are unusual… Almost miraculous. I don't believe in mysticism, but one has to accept the obvious facts. \nSo I chose to give your father an opportunity to study some of them.
6192354999870234 So you're a philanthropist, huh?
6192354999870235 And what exactly was he doing there?
6192354999870236 No, I'm a selfish man, acting entirely in his own interest. Slave labor is inefficient, for one. The Kin are dying out under these unbearable work conditions. \nI don't want to be the owner of a ruined and broken… well, <i>asset,</i> robbed of any will to flourish. Pardon my cynicism.
6192354999870237 I like you, Vlad.
6192354999870238 You sound insincere.
6192354999870239 There is some sort of… contraption in the facility. What is it?
6192354999870240 I can't say for sure. I've been to the place a few times, but never had an opportunity to scrutinize your father's work. I think he was combining… unusual ingredients. Making organic mixtures of some sort. He had a fascinating theory about natural elements, and how they intertwine… a universal synthesis hypothesis.
6192354999870241 Yeah… You mean the Lines.
6192354999870242 Do you know how the contraption works?
6192354999870243 No, he assembled it himself… and I doubt he explained how it works to anyone. I guess you'll have to figure that out on your own.\nAnd remember what I told about before—be discreet. I would hate it if anyone found out about the place. Do I have your word?
6192354999870244 My word binds. I won't risk breaking it.
6192354999870245 Yes.
6192354999870246 There is an urchin who knows about the place already. But I'll take care of him.
6192354999870247 Please do.
6192354999870248 Deal.
6192354999870249 …If I ever see him again.
6192354999870404 …How long has it been? Seven years?
6192354999870405 Less. It's been five years since I left.
6192354999870406 Seven? Maybe. You always were better with numbers.
6192354999870407 You've changed, Lara. Grown. Your eyes look so cold.
6192354999870408 Feels like ten.
6192354999870409 Why are you giving me that look?
6192354999870410 You know I have a heart condition. And the air here is thick.
6192354999870411 Why are you giving me that look?
6192354999870412 You smell like blood.
6192354999870413 Ah, that's… nothing.
6192354999870414 Everyone does. Trust me, I'm a surgeon.
6192354999870415 We share the same pain, now. Siblings in suffering. That's why you've come to see me, isn't it?
6192354999870416 What are you talking about?
6192354999870421 We dearly loved our fathers. Now they're both gone. Yours, killed this morning. Mine, this past spring, after the Battle at the Fords. Many terrible things happened… while you were away.
6192354999870422 I'm sorry. I didn't know your father well… but I always respected him. He must have been killed in action, then?
6192354999870423 This morning… Lara, what are you saying?
6192354999870424 Yes. He was killed. Do you know anything about it?
6192354999870425 Oh. You don't know…
6192354999870426 Speak.
6192354999870427 Forget it. I don't want to talk about it. Why are you back?
6192354999870428 Father sent me a letter… two weeks ago, now. A disturbing letter, where he wrote about his involvement in something dangerous.
6192354999870429 I think I have to figure that out, still. Will you help me, Lara? Are we still friends?
6192354999870430 I think I now know why. To take my father's place.
6192354999870431 He was murdered at dawn. At your home. No one knows who the culprit was. \nThe common crowd blames it on a shabnak—yes, the steppe monster. Others claim some woman killed him. Others still, they swear it was an outsider, a huge man in bloody clothes… like you.
6192354999870432 You don't suspect me, do you?
6192354999870433 And what will you do now?
6192354999870434 I'll find the killer, of course.
6192354999870435 I don't know.
6192354999870436 I'll demand justice. I'll surrender myself to the authorities, explain everything… Who's in charge now?
6192354999870437 You know what? You aren't going anywhere—I won't let you. Take a look at yourself. You can barely stand, let alone run around chasing some assailant.\nYou're staying. Eat something, then get some sleep. When you wake up, we'll figure out the rest. How's that?
6192354999870438 Fair enough. I'm on my last legs…
6192354999870439 I took a beating, Lara. That's why I'm swaying…
6192354999870440 Thank you. I wouldn't mind a bite or two.
6192354999870478 Just take whatever you need. There must be something in the cabinet in the hall.
6192354999870479 Should I sleep upstairs? That's where the guest rooms used to be, anyway… when we were kids.
6192354999870480 You won't even set a table for me? No bread, no salt? No hospitality…
6192354999870490 No. Don't go upstairs. It's all locked.\nEver since Father died, I don't go up there. Use this bed, instead.
6192354999870491 …Lara, what's wrong? Why won't you look at me?
6192354999870492 Whatever. If you're unhappy to see me, say so.
6192354999870493 …You know where things are. My home is your home. Make yourself comfortable.
6192354999870494 …Lara, what's wrong? Why won't you look at me?
6192354999870495 You know, I think I should leave. Time is of the essence.
6192354999870496 Don't, not now. Go and eat! You know it's September, don't you? Do you even remember what autumn is like here?\nYou must eat, even if portions are small, or else you'll become feeble. Your father taught us this!
6192354999870497 I know, I know…
6192354999870498 Don't mention Father. Please, not now.
6192354999870499 Must I remind you that you need more sleep than usual?\nIt's September! The steppe cools, the twyre blooms. Have you forgotten? When did you last sleep?
6192354999870500 You're right. I haven't slept in a while. Although, I did take a nap while I traveled.
6192354999870501 Stop shouting. I know more about the steppe and twyre than you do, all right?
6192354999870502 Can't you spare an hour, or five? Yes, time is precious. So what!\nThe worst is over. Are you afraid things might worsen still? They won't. Your father's killer won't flee… Until the next train, at least.
6192354999870503 True… I should eat. Get some sleep. In that order.
6192354999870504 I'm not afraid of anything.
6192354999870505 Thank you, Lara… Although, I can't shake the feeling something's not right.
6192354999870506 It's not like you have anywhere else to go. You're that fugitive people are after, aren't you?
6192354999870507 Seems so.
6192354999870508 Not me, no.
6192354999870509 While you're asleep, I'll go on a walk, test the waters. Perhaps I'll learn something, or better yet, make them see they might be hunting the wrong person.
6192354999870510 Sounds wonderful. Thank you, Lara.
6192354999870511 Might be? So you believe it, too? I never expected this from you, of all people.
6192354999870512 Just be careful. People are wild out there.
6192354999870513 …Wake up, Cub! There's someone upstairs! A thief must have gotten in. Or someone even worse…?
6192354999870514 You don't have much to steal.
6192354999870515 "Cub"? So, Gravel… You've remembered our old friendship.
6192354999870516 Ugh, what a dream I had. Twyre is indeed in full bloom.
6192354999870517 Something's fumbling around, I hear it. What if it's… the thing? The thing that killed Isidor?\nWhat if the soil spit out a shabnak after all?
6192354999870518 Don't be silly. Even I don't believe those tales—it's unbecoming of you, all right?
6192354999870519 I'll look around. Just stay calm.
6192354999870520 Well, I hope so. Is there a weapon I can borrow?
6192354999870521 Of course not. Maybe a knife in the kitchen, I guess.
6192354999870522 Forget it. I'll get by on strength, if needed.
6192354999870523 It'll have to do.
6192354999870524 You're the one acting silly! You've forgotten everything. Don't you remember those bones we found strung together? Isidor himself told us those were shabnak remains.
6192354999870525 He was just trying to scare us.
6192354999870526 Drink some water and calm down. Even if a shabnak did come into town, it wouldn't climb up a building.
6192354999870527 Well?
6192354999870528 I'll check in a minute. I need to collect my thoughts… Still troubled by the dream I had…
6192354999870529 Wait a minute. I need to think.
6192354999870530 Things still look bad for you, Cub… but I managed to help a little.
6192354999870531 What'd you do?
6192354999870532 What looks bad?
6192354999870533 It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to be Cub again. I missed you, Lara.
6192354999870534 People's brains have turned to mush. Some insist you killed Simon. Others, that… you killed Isidor.\nThe rest believe it was a shabnak who stole your shape, so they punish random women, any women they find.
6192354999870535 Ah, sweet home. Clarity of mind, sound logic—that's why I love my fellow countrymen.
6192354999870536 What? People think I killed my own father?
6192354999870537 But I only arrived at dawn! Got stabbed at once. I didn't even make it off the train!
6192354999870538 They don't care. They don't think, Cub! Blame September. They're all steppe-headed. Twyre-ridden.
6192354999870539 "Steppe, endless steppe, the way lies far before us…"
6192354999870540 All right. What must I do, then?
6192354999870541 They'll come to their senses soon. You know how mobs work. I explained, to the right folks, you had nothing to do with Isidor's death. Women, mostly. They'll spread the news quick. Here in the Flank, at least. In the Chine, in Backbone… you'll be safer.
6192354999870542 They'll come to their senses. But I'll forever be suspected of patricide.
6192354999870543 Thank you, Lara. I'll never forget this. Now I just need to find Stakh…
6192354999870544 That's up to you, Cub.
6192354999870545 Is it?
6192354999870546 As usual…
6192354999870547 You were gone for… six years? You're an outsider now, and you came back on the wrong side. Maybe you didn't kill Isidor, but you killed someone, right?\nI didn't even need to see the blood. Your butcher's eyes told me everything… That thousand-yard stare.
6192354999870548 Five years, not six. Closer this time, though.
6192354999870549 Butchers aren't monsters. They're workers.
6192354999870550 It was kill or be killed. You'd rather see me dead?
6192354999870551 Go ahead. But don't act surprised if you're unwelcome.
6192354999870552 How come?
6192354999870553 I'm not fragile. I'll manage.
6192354999870554 His dedication to Isidor… Few sons are as loyal to their fathers. He's grown cold toward you, the one who abandoned his mentor.\nPerhaps he thought he could replace you as Isidor's heir. Now… I bet he'll lose his mind. All in all, don't expect kindness from him.
6192354999870555 I've done nothing wrong.
6192354999870556 Do you also think I'm a monster?
6192354999870557 You'll have to start over, Cub. Although… maybe not entirely. The Kin must be eager to see you.\nWith Isidor gone, someone has to take his place. Not just for your steppe people, but for us all.
6192354999870558 I know.
6192354999870559 Thank you, Gravel. For everything.
6192354999870560 That's how you see me? "Your steppe people" and "us"? I shouldn't have come back at all.
6192354999870576 So what was it?
6192354999870577 Nothing. You must have imagined it.
6192354999870578 Some… beggar, I think, broke into your house. She's babbling nonsense. Should I toss her out?
6192354999870579 Well, she's not a shabnak. Don't worry. She'll leave soon.
6192354999870580 Why did you go upstairs? I told you, there's nothing to see there.
6192354999870581 You have a guest.
6192354999870582 Who's the girl upstairs?
6192354999870583 Just felt nostalgic, is all.
6192354999870584 No one's there! Everything's locked up. Get some sleep this instant. Your hallucinations scare me.
6192354999870585 You're right. I need sleep.
6192354999870586 Some creepy brat's up there, just grinning! Said a bunch of nasty things to me.
6192354999870587 Burakh, to bed! Now! You're seeing nonexistent girls! Give it half an hour, and you'll imagine even scarier monsters. Have some pity on my nerves! Go to bed!
6192354999870588 Fine. I'm not one to pry into the secrets of others.
6192354999870589 Autumn air, twyre in bloom… Understood. Goodnight.
6192354999870590 Don't. If she's already here, let her be. Maybe she's hiding from the violent mob. I'll check on her later, provide some care, if needed.
6192354999870591 She's not so gentle. More likely, you'll need that care.
6192354999870592 She could use that.
6192354999870593 So, here we are again… I managed to calm down Stakh. He was wrong about you. Or… he was not entirely right, at least.
6192354999870594 But still right, huh?
6192354999870595 What got into him?
6192354999870596 Were you already offered your father's inheritance, Cub? Refuse it, I beg you! Do not follow his path.
6192354999870597 Why would I refuse?
6192354999870598 You're too late. I've already accepted what I must do.
6192354999870599 …Inheritance?
6192354999870600 I don't know if I can properly explain this… There is no happiness down this path, not for yourself or others. Your father's path was cruel, Cub.
6192354999870601 Explain yourself.
6192354999870602 My father? Cruel?
6192354999870603 All in all, this is a quiet town. Not perfect, but there's a place for everyone. We're all connected through bonds of love, of friendship, of patience.\nLife flows through those bonds, the Town's veins, and to cut them would cause harm. Your father… don't be mad… he dreamed of remaking it all.
6192354999870604 I'm sure he had his reasons.
6192354999870605 You're being awfully poetic about this.
6192354999870606 What exactly did he want to change?
6192354999870607 Everything. Our town felt wrong to him.\nHe used to say that broken bones set badly will cripple a man, leaving him unable to function as others do. To Isidor, our town was a vile malunion.
6192354999870608 Perhaps he thought that for a reason.
6192354999870609 I'm not too fond of our town, either, after that welcome I received.
6192354999870610 He <i>was</i> a healer, sure. He knew life as no one else could. The Kin revered him. But even that did us more harm than good, in the end.
6192354999870611 What do you mean?
6192354999870612 Five years ago, there was an outbreak in the Crude Sprawl. It spread like wildfire—dozens and dozens dead. People sent for Isidor.\nWhen he arrived, he… he ordered the whole quarter to be quarantined. No one could leave, not even the healthy people trapped inside.
6192354999870613 It was the right decision.
6192354999870614 That's terrible, but I'd make the same call in his shoes.
6192354999870615 Impossible!
6192354999870616 The townsfolk obeyed his orders without question. They barricaded the whole neighborhood. In the end, there were almost no survivors.
6192354999870617 But the Town lived on.
6192354999870618 I suppose that is true. But Cub… do not take his inheritance. Isidor's inheritance is his power, his authority, his duties. If you become another Isidor, we will never rest, we will never know peace.
6192354999870619 There's no rest for the wicked.
6192354999870620 Peace only lasts until the next war.
6192354999870621 I see what you mean, dear Gravel. I will think about it.
6192354999870622 As Stakh would explain this, Isidor's inheritance involves more than material possessions—it's a legacy. Accepting his legacy would mean taking his place among the Kin. They expect that of you.
6192354999870623 What's so bad about following in my father's footsteps?
6192354999870624 He was a kind man, but his deeds were… ruthless.
6192354999870625 What do you mean?
6192354999870626 A surgeon can't avoid spilling blood.
6192354999870627 You should let him speak for himself.
6192354999870628 I want to talk to you first. He can wait.
6192354999870629 I already did. If you ask me, the man's losing his marbles.
6192354999870630 <i>"A sad pup there was laying,\nAnd a kitten dismaying,\nJust a couple of pitiless creatures…"</i>\n…I don't remember the rest. Do you?
6192354999870631 Yeah. You're singing it wrong. It's "a couple of pitiful creatures," not "pitiless."
6192354999870632 No, I don't. Where's the caretaker?
6192354999870633 I'm the caretaker. Now, anyway… Why are you giving me that look? My father is. Was. He died three years ago.
6192354999870634 Seems like the whole Town's orphaned.
6192354999870635 Aren't you a little too young for this job?
6192354999870636 I'm singing it right.
6192354999870637 Who are you, kid?
6192354999870638 Why are you so sad?
6192354999870639 It's so cruel that people can't rest in peace, even after death. Whose sins are we punished for? Why does the soil push out Old Burakh?
6192354999870640 …What?
6192354999870641 I've heard it's because he was a surgeon, that he cut things apart instead of joining them. How foolish…
6192354999870642 I'm young, yes. But no one else can speak with the dead, can they?
6192354999870643 I'm Artemy Burakh, kid. I came here to give my father a proper burial.
6192354999870644 You can speak to the dead?
6192354999870645 Yes. They need consolation. Earth cradles them, but it can't ease their pain.
6192354999870646 I think you're the one who needs consolation.
6192354999870647 They tried to bury him twice already. But the Earth won't take him… It pushes the body upwards.\nThat means he's got something left undone in the world. Owes a debt… He was a man of obligation.
6192354999870648 What debt?
6192354999870649 "Pushes upwards"? What the hell does that mean?
6192354999870650 He was buried deep. But when your people returned with the seeds and the milk, per the rite, they saw his body lying in the open again. \nEarth pushed him out. Father said a similar thing happened before, when they buried Chief Urehlin. But he was a really bad person… Not like Old Burakh at all!
6192354999870651 I can't believe what I'm hearing. How is that possible?
6192354999870652 Are you out of your mind, kid?
6192354999870653 I don't know. It's just… he carried too heavy a burden. He failed to do something important… because his life was cut short. Your people say that if the ground doesn't take him, they'll burn him, as the old rite demands. But it's horrible!
6192354999870654 All right. Stay here. No need to follow me.
6192354999870655 Cremation isn't a crime. If things are the way you say, at least it's better than that… outrage!
6192354999870656 It is a crime! The dead mustn't be burned! Earth doesn't destroy; it preserves! It dissolves them and saves them for future harvests! \nEarth is alive here! If you burn people, how will they speak? How will they bloom? How will they return? Do you have <i>any</i> idea what you're talking about?
6192354999870657 Calm down! You're hysterical!
6192354999870658 If one mustn't burn the dead, but digging is also frowned upon... then what options do we have?
6192354999870662 You don't believe me? I wanted to take his duty upon myself, and even said the vow… but nothing happened. They just looked at me as though I'm crazy.\nIt's because I'm not a steppe person. I don't really understand all of it.
6192354999870663 What vow?
6192354999870678 Why did you come? You aren't allowed to be here now.
6192354999870679 All right. Sorry. I'm leaving.
6192354999870680 Is it true you spoke to my father today?
6192354999870681 I've heard that you… Ah, whatever. It's bullshit anyway.
6192354999870688 No, I didn't…
6192354999870689 Grace. That's what they call you, right? Look at me.
6192354999870690 That's what I thought. Goodnight.
6192354999870691 Someone saw you talk to my father.
6192354999870692 All right, fine… It's true. The dead need to be spoken with. Otherwise they're in too much pain.
6192354999870693 Do they answer?
6192354999870694 Sometimes. When they do, I feel pain too.
6192354999870695 A girl told me it kills you slowly. Is that true?
6192354999870696 Clara, right? But… she praised me. Said I'm doing the right thing by consoling the dead. She's a very kind girl, though there are those who hate her, for some reason.
6192354999870697 Can you help me talk to my father?
6192354999870698 Does it kill you or does it not?
6192354999870699 I don't know… I'd need to ask him. I've never done that before.
6192354999870700 Don't. Let's not waste your life on trivialities.
6192354999870701 What did he tell you today?
6192354999870702 Please do.
6192354999870703 It hurts me. Clara said I only have enough strength for three or four more conversations. After that, I may die.
6192354999870704 I see. I'll leave you be, then.
6192354999870705 What did my father say to you?
6192354999870706 Three or four? Okay. We'll have to strategize about how best to use your ability, then.
6192354999870707 He said that it hurts. That he never expected it, that it was strange… As if a friend had killed him. He's very sad he didn't get to see you. \nBut he also said nothing would have changed even if you'd gotten here on time.
6192354999870708 Something <i>would</i> have changed: He'd still be alive.
6192354999870709 A friend, huh? Interesting…
6192354999870710 Go on, then: Ask him. How do you do it, I wonder? I need to talk to him.
6192354999870711 I need rest… Can you come back later, please? I don't feel so well right now…
6192354999870712 Of course. Goodbye.
6192354999870713 Let me talk to my father, and I'll leave after.
6192354999870714 You hit hard for a hunchback! But whoa, boy, you screwed up! Those three guys are dead. I saw you do it, too. You're gonna be in serious trouble!
6192354999870715 A hunchback…? Kid, I'm bent over in pain here!
6192354999870716 What kind of doggy are you?
6192354999870717 Shut up, mongrel. Won't take much work for me to add a fourth to the pile.
6192354999870719 You need to handle that bleeding, old man. You're covered in blood. Your own blood!
6192354999870720 I know that.
6192354999870721 You don't need to lecture me, boy. I'm a surgeon.
6192354999870722 I'm a watchdog, and I watch out for your soul. No, wait, I'm a guide dog. I'm gonna guide your soul to its rightful place when you die.
6192354999870723 <i>My</i> soul? These poor fools need your help first.
6192354999870724 I'll definitely die if I don't stop this bleeding. If only I had a bandage…
6192354999870725 Here you go. A tourniquet! It used to be my leash, but… seems like you need it more.
6192354999870726 Thanks. You're a nice kid.
6192354999870727 A leash? No thanks. I'd rather avoid leashes.
6192354999870728 Or do you want my collar? You could fix your leg with it.
6192354999870729 Actually… sure. Hand it over. An underdog can't throw help away.
6192354999870730 I'll manage.
6192354999870731 Man, you really have some anger problems, don't you? Zing! Pow! Blam! Three guys dead! This ain't the right way. Ain't how we do things around here.
6192354999870732 Yeah? What's the right way, then?
6192354999870733 Kid, "around here" isn't anywhere special.
6192354999870734 I'll handle it. It's my sin to carry—I don't need a lecture.
6192354999870735 Oh, I saw that. You're sure good at cutting people. All reflexes. A slicer-dicer!
6192354999870736 Yes, I am good at cutting people.
6192354999870737 Do you have anything I can use to stop this bleeding?
6192354999870738 Well, you gotta be nicer! Just hit 'em—three times, max. Send 'em running, and let 'em run! You don't actually have to kill everyone who bothers you! Jeez!
6192354999870739 I'll… keep that in mind.
6192354999870740 It's safer my way.
6192354999870741 But this town <i>is</i> special. I mean, the <i>folks</i> are ordinary. But the Town…
6192354999870742 I know. I was born here.
6192354999870743 Well, if everyone here is like you… then maybe you're right.
6192354999870744 Oh, man, you're gonna get in trouble! The two guys that got away are gonna stir up the whole Town. Every dog has its day! They'll make you apologize for sure. On your back. In the dirt.
6192354999870745 I didn't have a choice!
6192354999870746 I won't apologize to anyone. I acted in self-defense.
6192354999870747 Look at you—feeling better! But the Town's not too welcoming, is it? \nDon't worry. The steppe is wide. It can hide anyone. What brings you here?
6192354999870748 Who are you, kid?
6192354999870749 I didn't come here to hide.
6192354999870750 I <i>am</i> feeling better. Thanks for helping me back there.
6192354999870751 Why do you ask?
6192354999870752 Are you here alone?
6192354999870753 Tell me straight—were you the one who poisoned the dogs?
6192354999870754 Nope. All quiet. Only three of us here—you and me and two best friends.
6192354999870755 …Was it you then, buddy?
6192354999870756 We're not friends, kid. So there's only two of us here. Which means you're on your own.
6192354999870757 As you wish! Can't hide from yourself, anyway. That's what they say.
6192354999870758 They also say that you're a pathetic little punk.
6192354999870759 But there's a criminal doing just that, hiding around here somewhere. Have you seen him?
6192354999870760 All lies! I'm a good, kind soul.
6192354999870761 So it's true… Honestly, I'm surprised.
6192354999870762 Explain yourself.
6192354999870763 No, the steppe has a hundred eyes. It sees everything, it remembers everything. Leave me be, killer-man. I might end up being useful to you.
6192354999870764 The steppe won't help you. It doesn't need murderous whelps.
6192354999870765 Why did you do it, you little punk? Why did you kill the dogs?
6192354999870766 You're welcome. I'd tell you, "scratch my back and I'll scratch yours," but I'm not the type to demand back-scratching back. So what do you want? Need another wound dressed?
6192354999870767 I'm looking for the punk who poisoned the boys' dogs. Know where he is?
6192354999870768 Who are you, kid?
6192354999870769 The Soul-and-a-Halves are the real punks, and Notkin is the worst. And punks deserve to suffer, right?\nBut you can't hurt them. They just wipe the blood away and keep going. So you need to hit them where it <i>does</i> hurt. Right in the heart. Make them see how it feels!
6192354999870770 "Hit them where it hurts," huh? I think they were right. This world doesn't need people like you.
6192354999870771 Hold this leash for a second, will you?
6192354999870772 You're disgusting. Scram.
6192354999870773 No, no, spare me! We're friends! I helped you out, didn't I? You owe me!\nDoesn't that mean anything to you? Let me go. Maybe I could be useful to you!
6192354999870774 I also owe it to the boys to do the right thing. So here, have this: a gift from them.
6192354999870775 I do respect my debts. Hopefully this one counts even if I let you go.
6192354999870776 Get lost… As if I would foul my hands with your blood!
6192354999870777 Wonderful! So off you go.\nBy the way, if you need anyone to confirm that you only arrived <i>this morning,</i> and couldn't have murdered anyone last night, just say the word. I'll run to Saburov and testify.
6192354999870778 I don't need anything from you. Get lost!
6192354999870779 Yes… That would be useful, actually. Wait for me by the Town Hall.
6192354999870780 Saburov…?
6192354999870781 Our bloodsucking governor. He's been sitting on his hands for five years, so now they're itching to strangle someone. He calls it "justice." \nBut… he'll take witness testimony. He's a bloodsucker, but he's a bloodsucker with a code. Wanna head over there?
6192354999870782 Fine. Wait for me by the Town Hall. I'll be there.
6192354999870783 I'll manage just fine without you. I don't need help from scumbags.
6192354999870784 First, stay! Then, play!
6192354999870785 So they didn't hurt you after all?
6192354999870786 …Are you okay? Something seems off.
6192354999870787 So you got your just deserts, huh?
6192354999870788 You friend? Outsiders, beware!
6192354999870789 No, we're not friends.
6192354999870790 How am I an outsider? I'm a local. And we've met!
6192354999870791 Don't touch. Bad boy! Bad boy!
6192354999870792 You gotta actually woof to make the joke work. What a stupid prank.
6192354999870793 No, you're a good boy! Keep up the good work.
6192354999870794 The one with the knife was Kirik. A leatherworker. Not gonna cry for him—that guy was nuts.
6192354999870795 Was this an ambush? How long were they waiting for me?
6192354999870796 And who were the others?
6192354999870797 They weren't waiting for you. I think <i>you</i> were an accident.
6192354999870798 Then who was the real target?
6192354999870799 An "accident"? Is this kind of accident common around here?
6192354999870800 Hell if I know. Cannery workers. You can tell by their hands.
6192354999870801 You've got a sharp eye.
6192354999870802 Moonlighting as highwaymen? Does the cannery underpay them?
6192354999870803 Four eyes! Ain't no joke.
6192354999870804 Look, I just want to know why they jumped me.
6192354999870805 I dunno. Rumor's going around that someone else got murdered tonight. Guess I should sniff around and find out… Who knows? Maybe it's true.
6192354999870806 Good boy.
6192354999870807 I hope it isn't. This town's seen enough blood for one day.
6192354999870808 Sometimes. But things usually go smoothly, and everyone meets the fate they were destined for. Every bullet finds its billet!
6192354999870809 Every bullet finds its billet indeed.
6192354999870810 I'm not a big believer in fate.
6192354999870811 So why did they jump me, then?
6192354999870812 Go away. I saw everything. No one saw me. But I did.
6192354999870813 What did you see?
6192354999870814 Why do you want me to go away?
6192354999870815 What do they call you, kiddo?
6192354999870816 Everything.
6192354999870817 Did you see the fight?
6192354999870818 Did you see me get off the train?
6192354999870819 I don't.
6192354999870820 Did you see the fight?
6192354999870821 Did you see me get off the train?
6192354999870822 I'm not a kiddo. And no one calls me.
6192354999870823 Did you see the fight?
6192354999870824 Did you see me get off the train?
6192354999870825 What is there about you to love? Nothing. So I don't.
6192354999870826 That's all right. You don't have to love me.
6192354999870827 Perhaps there is something.
6192354999870828 The important thing is, you saw me arrive at dawn. Right?
6192354999870829 I don't need you. Nuh-uh. Things were great without you. Great.
6192354999870830 I need <i>you,</i> though. So don't go anywhere, all right?
6192354999870831 Okay… maybe we will become friends. When you get a little older.
6192354999870832 Honestly, I don't need you, either. You're not very friendly.
6192354999870833 Grace.
6192354999870834 Why?
6192354999870835 A cemetery is no place for lonely girls.
6192354999870836 She's killing herself. Grace is. She doesn't care.
6192354999870837 Killing herself…?
6192354999870838 Being scared.
6192354999870839 What are you scared of?
6192354999870840 She talks to the dead for real. Touches them with her head. But it kills the living. I'm telling her, that's not how it's done! But she won't listen…
6192354999870841 And how is it done? Like there's a different way...
6192354999870842 Touches them with her head? What?
6192354999870843 There is another way. I can show you. Come on. Just walk with smaller steps.
6192354999870844 Wait a second. I want to check on Grace first.
6192354999870845 All right, let's go.
6192354999870846 Yes. Touches them with her head.
6192354999870847 I'd like to see <i>that…</i>
6192354999870848 And that's killing her?
6192354999870849 Tell her not to do it! Tell her she's doing it wrong! Tell her I know how to do it right.
6192354999870850 Do you?
6192354999870851 Yes. Clara says Grace will die completely if she does it three more times.
6192354999870852 But you know a different way, huh?
6192354999870853 Clara who?
6192354999870854 My new friend. She also said my way is better.
6192354999870855 What way?
6192354999870856 …
6192354999870857 What are you doing here?
6192354999870858 Why are you so gloomy?
6192354999870859 Why did you come here? I don't need you. Nobody here needs you. We're not friends with her anymore, anyway.
6192354999870860 No longer friends with whom?
6192354999870861 What are you doing here?
6192354999870862 So?
6192354999870863 Relax. She's sleeping now.
6192354999870864 You said you'd show me how to talk to the dead.
6192354999870865 She's probably dead.
6192354999870866 Nope. She's just as alive as you or I.
6192354999870867 You said you'd show me how to talk to the dead.
6192354999870868 Yes. I know a different way.
6192354999870869 Let's go, then.
6192354999870870 Just go slow. I've got short legs. And I can't run.
6192354999870871 I'll carry you on my back. Hop on.
6192354999870872 Why can't you run?
6192354999870873 It's not polite.
6192354999870874 Not polite?
6192354999870875 Yes. It makes the Earth mad. It's alive, after all.
6192354999870876 Well, that all makes sense now. Let me carry you.
6192354999870877 Fine. We'll walk slowly.
6192354999870878 It'll manage. Earth and I are old pals.
6192354999870879 So do you want to know how to do it right? How to talk to the people in the ground?
6192354999870880 Yes.
6192354999870881 Are you for real? Can you really do that?
6192354999870943 You're here. Good. The trial can begin.
6192354999870944 Go on.
6192354999870945 But who is the accused, kids? Shouldn't you at least present them to me?
6192354999870946 Who are you anyway, runt?
6192354999870947 A question first: They say you're no son to Old Burakh.\nHe was a doctor. He saved lives. It is said that you kill instead. Is that true?
6192354999870948 Ah. So <i>that's</i> who the accused is.
6192354999870949 I am a Burakh. Have no doubt.
6192354999870950 Is what true? That this town is full of gossips and rumormongers? Yeah, it surely is.
6192354999870951 Answer the question, please. Are you a murderer or no?
6192354999870952 I… may have killed, yes.
6192354999870953 No. And listening to idle chatter does you no good.
6192354999870954 Killing is not necessarily murder.
6192354999870955 Calm down. No need to get defensive. Or are you uncomfortable doing this in front of my Soul-and-a-Halves?
6192354999870957 Aren't you cheeky, boy.
6192354999870958 Don't "calm down" me, boy. You want to put me on trial? Go on, then.
6192354999870959 Tell me: Is it right to kill? We need to know what you believe. Old Burakh wasn't just a doctor to us. He was a teacher. He knew how to live.\nYou say you are his son, so you're to take his place and answer: Is murder acceptable?
6192354999870960 It's right to kill someone who preys on the weak and defenseless; to take revenge against those who deserve it.
6192354999870961 Only in self-defense.
6192354999870962 Only to protect a loved one.
6192354999870963 No. Killing is never right. Never forget that.
6192354999870964 Cheeky or not, this isn't a game. We're talking about something important here.
6192354999870965 I'm all ears.
6192354999870966 Then stop trying to get under my skin, boy. Consider how they paint me as a dangerous man…
6192354999870967 Notkin. <i>Chief</i> Notkin 'round here. But the real question is: who are <i>you?</i>
6192354999870968 I am Artemy Burakh. Son of Isidor.
6192354999870969 What's with the frown? …You're thinking about your father, aren't you?
6192354999870970 Yes. I am.
6192354999870971 I'm done with this interrogation, boy. Stop wasting my time.
6192354999870972 So murder <i>can</i> be right sometimes?
6192354999870973 Looks like it.
6192354999870974 Who are you planning on killing, boy?
6192354999870975 But do you plan to avenge your father?
6192354999870976 Of course. If I can find the culprit…
6192354999870977 We're talking about you, children, not about me.
6192354999870978 …Perhaps I won't.
6192354999870979 Good. We now know the kind of man you are. Here ends the trial. You're free to go.
6192354999870980 So you know me, huh? That was quick. Guess I should talk to you if I'm ever confused.
6192354999870981 …I don't get it.
6192354999870982 It's not about <i>me,</i> but about <i>us.</i> My Soul-and-a-Halves always hang together. \nAnswer the question. Take your time if you need to. You may very well be choosing our fate.
6192354999870983 Fine. Yes, sometimes killing is acceptable.
6192354999870984 No. Murder is never acceptable.
6192354999870985 You're so tall… Think you can beat me at wrestling?
6192354999870986 Bad idea.
6192354999870987 Don't want to hurt you, boy.
6192354999870988 What? You have your revenge and so do we. We now know how to deal with Lika, and that verdict can't be appealed. \nAll you and I have in common now is that today will end soon. Go. Thanks for your help.
6192354999870989 Don't tell me what to do. I can figure out my own schedule.
6192354999870990 Just don't get carried away, tough guy.
6192354999870991 Wait a second. What did this Lika do, anyway?
6192354999870992 So, is revenge bad too?
6192354999870993 Do as I say, not as I do.
6192354999870994 Revenge is inevitable, boy. I'm already plotting mine.
6192354999870995 Yes. Life finds its own way of punishing the wicked.
6192354999870996 Lika poisoned our friends, who were weak and defenseless. It's an open and shut case.
6192354999870997 You mean the dogs?
6192354999870999 We are Soul-and-a-Halves. To us, they were not mere dogs, but friends. And we prefer them to people.
6192354999871000 Agreed. So…?
6192354999871001 Why do they call you "Soul-and-a-Halves"?
6192354999871002 We each have a Half, besides our own soul. See this gray cat here, chasing his own tail? That's Jester. We're always together.
6192354999871003 I see no cat, though.
6192354999871004 Cut to the chase. You're planning to kill this Lika?
6192354999871005 Of course you don't. He's <i>my</i> Half. Jester will only show himself to you when I trust you.
6192354999871006 So, about this Lika…
6192354999871007 The Gumstone! Steppeward from the Basket! Aren't you supposed to know all this? Or do you steppe folk have different names for everything?
6192354999871008 Nah, it's the same. I know the place.
6192354999871009 Ah, yeah… The steppe people call it Uur Heelu: "Hatred." See you around, pups.
6192354999871010 What matters is where he fled to. And that, we know.
6192354999871011 So he won't escape reckoning. Good.
6192354999871012 And where would that be?
6192354999871013 Why do you care?
6192354999871014 Listen, kids. I'll handle this.
6192354999871015 I'm just looking for a good place to hide.
6192354999871016 Where did that come from? He's our problem, not yours. You've done your part; we'll do the rest.
6192354999871017 You'll put him on guard. I, however, can get the drop on him.
6192354999871018 You're scaring me. I'm starting to suspect you're not joking.
6192354999871019 Why the jitters, old man? You looked tougher when you told us that murder is righteous.\nOn your way, Burakh the Younger. We'll work this one out ourselves.
6192354999871020 You'll regret it.
6192354999871021 So long then, "chief."
6192354999871022 …We have a deal. Murky says it's by the Gumstone.
6192354999871023 Where's that?
6192354999871024 Ah, I know the place. The lad knows his hideouts.
6192354999871025 Who's Murky?
6192354999871026 Wow, is that so? This changes things.
6192354999871027 How come?
6192354999871028 So, you say murder is bad. But it's easy for you to say. You've gave Wolfling a bone. Never fed Duke. Never met Lika. I'd like to see if you'd change your tune when you actually encountered the traitor. \nI bet my soul you'd lose it and snap his neck.
6192354999871029 What are you saying…?
6192354999871030 You really oughta take better care of that soul.
6192354999871031 It's fine; I've a Half on top of it, after all.
6192354999871032 You have what?
6192354999871033 Here's the deal. You're so full of the milk of human kindness, go and meet Lika for yourself. And if you truly, honestly believe a lying, cheating lowlife like him deserves to go free: Let him go free.\nBut if you figure he needs to be taught a lesson… Give him this leash. It'll bring him back here, guaranteed.
6192354999871034 Are you testing me?
6192354999871035 Is this like a "black mark" of sorts?
6192354999871036 And then what? You'll kill him?
6192354999871037 Kind of.
6192354999871038 No deal, then. I don't do "tests."
6192354999871039 All right. Deal.
6192354999871040 No. It's a leash. He'll know what it means. You won't.
6192354999871041 Find yourself a better-informed hitman, then.
6192354999871042 All right, I'll take it.
6192354999871043 Of course not. Didn't you teach us that murder is never right? But we <i>will</i> send him six feet under.
6192354999871044 I don't like the sound of this. No deal.
6192354999871045 I'll hold you to it.
6192354999871046 The girl in the corner. She was the one who told us you're a killer.
6192354999871047 Did she see me, then?
6192354999871048 So, what's that stone you were talking about…?
6192354999871049 Perhaps you could. And then what?
6192354999871050 If he's as bad as you say, I'll drag him over here.
6192354999871051 And then I snap his neck like a twig.
6192354999871052 I'll give him a spanking, I suppose.
6192354999871053 I'll figure it out when I get there.
6192354999871054 You know what? Give him this leash. He'll understand what it means. Will you do this for us?
6192354999871055 Sure.
6192354999871056 A leash? Why?
6192354999871057 Well, he's untrained, so just giving a command won't do. But this leash will do the trick. Just give it to him. Deal?
6192354999871058 Sure. I'm intrigued, even.
6192354999871059 What nonsense. I won't do it.
6192354999871060 She did. But don't bother her. She's frightened as it is.
6192354999871061 Fine. Where do I go?
6192354999871062 Stay here, then. This is sanctuary. No grown-up would dare enter.
6192354999871063 Got it. I appreciate the hospitality.
6192354999871064 …So, would you like me to deal with your poisoner?
6192354999871065 We each have a Half besides our own soul. See this gray cat here, chasing his own tail? That's Jester. We're always together.
6192354999871066 I see no cat, though.
6192354999871067 Ah, I see. So the pet is like the third half of your soul?
6192354999871068 Of course you don't. He's <i>my</i> Half. Jester will only show himself to you when I trust you.
6192354999871069 I see. So no one here trusts me quite yet…
6192354999871070 Indeed.
6192354999871071 Back to business, though. Why did you mention revenge at all?
6192354999871152 Jester thinks you're a decent sort, and he's not the only one. So, behold: We solemnly grant you this leash.\nIt means you're always welcome here. And that you may even get your own Half, one day. Not everyone does.
6192354999871153 What Jester?
6192354999871154 What did you do to the boy?
6192354999871155 Don't go singing my praises just yet. I let your poisoner go.
6192354999871156 A "half"?
6192354999871157 We didn't kill him, as you can see.
6192354999871158 Good. So instead, you…?
6192354999871159 I'm not so sure…
6192354999871160 My Half. My cat. Called "Jester" because he can rope-walk, stand on his forepaws, and eat raw potatoes.
6192354999871161 Cool.
6192354999871162 Can I see him?
6192354999871163 So what have you done to Lika?
6192354999871164 Not yet. He'll show himself to you when we know you're a good man.
6192354999871165 I look forward to it.
6192354999871166 Hope springs eternal.
6192354999871167 So what did you do to the boy?
6192354999871168 He took a trip underground. Deep.
6192354999871169 Folk don't dig pits in the Town. This I know; has something changed?
6192354999871170 You mean six feet deep, don't you?
6192354999871171 "Underground"?! What have you <i>done,</i> punks? Do you… do you even know something, <i>anything</i> about the ground here?
6192354999871172 Nothing has changed. But there is at least one pit.
6192354999871173 Has someone gone mad…? Where is it?
6192354999871174 Come on, are you serious? Those are old wives' tales…
6192354999871175 You fools! These are not tales!
6192354999871176 Where is it? Where is the pit?
6192354999871177 Deeper than that.
6192354999871178 Digging wells is forbidden in the Town. So stop trying to fool me.
6192354999871179 …I can't say. I gave my word.
6192354999871180 Whoever dug it will be <i>very</i> sorry.
6192354999871181 Fair enough. I won't make you snitch. But I'll find the culprit myself.
6192354999871182 …You let him go?
6192354999871183 I let him go.
6192354999871184 If I am to replace my father: Here ends your first lesson.
6192354999871185 …This changes nothing. Keep the leash. But for now, go; I need to think.
6192354999871186 You do that. It'll do you good.
6192354999871187 You'll understand why one day, boy.
6192354999871188 Half a soul more. A rook, a dog, or maybe a cat… though probably you'd get something huge. A bear, or a bull. We've never had a Half like that before.
6192354999871189 What did you do to the boy?
6192354999871190 I let Lika go.
6192354999871191 Perhaps you'll tame your own dragon when you grow up.
6192354999871192 Now, look. See Murky? There she broods. She saw you get off the train this morning. Saw as you got attacked. Saw everything.\nBut she doesn't talk much, and I think few grown-ups would believe her. It's better than nothing, though.
6192354999871193 Thank you. I'll have a word with her.
6192354999871194 I'd rather not drag an orphan girl into it. This business is murky enough as it is.
6192354999871268 Yesterday, I was told you had killed your father.
6192354999871269 …And you immediately believed it.
6192354999871270 Who told you that?
6192354999871271 Oh, of course! I finally achieved my childhood dream!
6192354999871272 The whole Town believed it. First, people found out he was dead. Then, they learned he was killed by an outsider. And then they described you.
6192354999871273 You're an idiot.
6192354999871274 The only fact in that pile of shit is I arrived on the night of his death.
6192354999871275 You knew how much I cared for him! So why, you idiot? What for?
6192354999871276 That's not far from the truth, Burakh.
6192354999871277 I'm two seconds away from breaking your jaw.
6192354999871278 You knew, all this time, I'm not a murderer? You just meant it as… what, some metaphor? I called you a friend…
6192354999871279 Why did you come? Finally thought of some good excuses?
6192354999871280 You think I need to justify myself to you?
6192354999871281 I'm waiting for <i>your</i> excuse, and apology—which I may not accept.
6192354999871282 The best form of defense is offense. You've always done it well.
6192354999871283 Stakh, are you out of your mind?
6192354999871284 It was not only a death. He was murdered.
6192354999871285 How many people live in this town, moron? Yet you still point to me as the culprit!
6192354999871286 You betrayed him. You left when he needed you most. He cried out for your help, but you didn't care. He was in peril, and you were too busy elsewhere. He believed, truly <i>believed,</i> that your arrival would put an end to his troubles. \nAnd, as always, he was right.
6192354999871287 …That's not true.
6192354999871288 Are you raving mad, Rubin?
6192354999871289 Take a breath, calm down, and explain. What peril? What do you know?
6192354999871290 Lara said I'm stupid, that I've lost my marbles. But I haven't! \nYour father always taught us to take stock of the situation, Burakh. Overall? You're unneeded here. Don't bother with your father's inheritance. He has better heirs.
6192354999871291 Like you?
6192354999871292 Lara's right. You <i>are</i> stupid.
6192354999871293 Already thinking about the inheritance, huh? Some of us still grieve.
6192354999871294 And why not? I was his student. I preserved his knowledge while you wiped your ass with his letters. I was always by his side.
6192354999871295 Including the night he was murdered?
6192354999871296 I am <i>this</i> close to hitting you.
6192354999871297 Here's his letter. The only one I received. Look here, idiot—he mentions a threat. What could it be?
6192354999871298 Shut up. Your father's inheritance is his <i>work</i>, Burakh. That's his legacy! You are completely unworthy of it. His work is not yours. His knowledge is not yours. You abandoned both.
6192354999871299 <i>He</i> sent me away, jackass! He wanted me to study elsewhere!
6192354999871300 Go elsewhere, then. Learn whatever it is you'll learn there. \nHere, you have no place. And if the Kin tells you to let go of his burden, listen—perhaps even that scum can be right, sometimes. You're out of your depth here.
6192354999871301 Poor Stakh. You know, I don't even want to hit you anymore.
6192354999871302 You're hysterical, man. You're barely making sense.
6192354999871303 I'm not going anywhere. You should listen to Gravel. You're acting stupid.
6192354999871304 …No. He wouldn't tell me. Suggested we wait for you to arrive. But you were in no hurry, were you? His first letter was sent in May!
6192354999871305 I only got a single letter. Two, maybe three weeks ago!
6192354999871306 There's a war, asshole. You think the trains come to this town often?
6192354999871307 His inheritance isn't… <i>things!</i> It's different. And don't you dare accuse me! As for you, Gravel, don't interfere.
6192354999871308 Who's investigating the murder? No one! But all you care about is some "inheritance." And you <i>dared</i> to accuse me. Tell me what you know!
6192354999871309 I know he was murdered. By someone he knew, too. Someone he trusted. Someone who could easily enter his house!
6192354999871310 This is what's important, idiot. Not an inheritance!
6192354999871311 …No.
6192354999871312 What <i>do</i> you know, then? Some student…
6192354999871343 I'm listening.
6192354999871344 I'm Artemy Burakh.
6192354999871345 No, <i>I'm</i> listening. Where's my father's body?
6192354999871346 Ahh, the patricide. You've spared me the trouble of hunting you down. You there! Seize him! And take him to number three, I think it's free.
6192354999871347 Patricide? Have you gone mad?
6192354999871348 Strike, if you will, but hear!
6192354999871349 I won't forget this.
6192354999871350 Oh, it's you. We made you a prime suspect yesterday. By mistake. Sorry—that was rash. You were too convincing a suspect. \nBut I won't hear you complain. The error wasn't irrevocable.
6192354999871351 Right. Not like you had me executed or anything. Nothing irrevocable about being branded a murderer and hunted like a dog.
6192354999871352 Did you find my father's murderer?
6192354999871353 Forget about it. My house is sealed off on your orders. So's the district. I need the key and a pass.
6192354999871354 I had a cozy place to sleep last night, thanks to you. But today I'd like to go to my own place. I need the key.
6192354999871355 Spare me the sarcasm, Burakh. \nLet's get this straight. You're still a suspect, and you'll be a suspect until the murderer's found and proven guilty. The only reason you're walking free is something called "the presumption of innocence." Do I make myself clear?
6192354999871356 Good thing some smart people told you about that.
6192354999871357 Perfectly. Where's my father's body?
6192354999871358 I head no investigation. There's no organized search. I hold no official post here, in case you had any illusions on that part.\nMy power is that of reputation. Traditionally, our family enforces order in the Town on the rare occasions that it's broken. And those are rare—believe me. This is a peaceful little town.
6192354999871359 I know. A village. And you're the sheriff.
6192354999871360 How can you talk about order if no one's looking for the murderer?
6192354999871361 Taken to the cemetery. \nHe was a steppe man, wasn't he? By the rites of the Kin, the deceased is to be buried on the day of death, or at least as quickly as possible. So the preparations should be underway already.
6192354999871362 Why didn't you start by saying that?!
6192354999871363 Then I need to hurry.
6192354999871364 Anything else I can help you with?
6192354999871365 My house is locked. Do you have the key?
6192354999871366 The house was locked by the committee that examined the crime scene. There may be evidence. It's in your best interest. And that of the committee.
6192354999871367 …The investigation that doesn't exist. Great.
6192354999871368 And what did the committee find?
6192354999871369 Nothing of interest. We don't have any professional investigators in town. Is it so hard to understand?\nAlthough one Bachelor Dankovsky, who the Kains invited from the Capital, expressed an interest in their summary. I found it appropriate to share their findings with him. So you may inquire with him.
6192354999871370 I will. Now I need the key.
6192354999871371 You may have the key. That house is your property, and I have no legal grounds to prevent your access.
6192354999871372 Exactly.
6192354999871373 So can I go home now?
6192354999871374 I need a pass. Your people are blocking off the district.
6192354999871375 If you want to go immediately, you won't be allowed in anyway.
6192354999871376 Why?
6192354999871377 The district was blocked off on my orders—and Bachelor Dankovsky's advice. Staying there might be unhealthy. Only medical personnel are allowed.\nBut I recall that you're a doctor, correct?
6192354999871378 Yes. So sign a pass for me, and I'll leave you alone.
6192354999871379 Yes, so I can take care of my own health.
6192354999871380 Anything else?
6192354999871381 The district is cordoned off by your people. I need a pass.
6192354999871382 You're a prickly man, Saburov. That can't be good for your health.
6192354999871383 You're a doctor, correct? In that case, you may have it.
6192354999871384 A surgeon.
6192354999871385 A doctor, yes.
6192354999871386 What does it matter?
6192354999871387 Our big-city guest, Bachelor Dankovsky, has issued a warning that the district might be unsafe for medical reasons. That's all I can tell you at this point.
6192354999871388 Good enough for me. Hand over the pass.
6192354999871389 Nosy, isn't he? Our big-city guest.
6192354999871390 Yes, you were acquainted with our jail yesterday. \nBut, having seen the jails of other towns myself, I will repeat: I will not hear you complain. The food was hot and filling, the cot was dry, and even the rats were polite enough, as far as I know. I will not apologize for doing my job.
6192354999871391 Commendable. Public safety's clearly in good hands.
6192354999871392 Why are you covered in blood?
6192354999871393 …I fell down the stairs.
6192354999871394 Who are you?
6192354999871395 That's not important. Who <i>you</i> are, that's important.
6192354999871396 Really?
6192354999871397 I'm Old Burakh's son.
6192354999871398 You're an outsider. I've never seen you before, and I know everyone.
6192354999871399 I'm from here, but I've been away for a while.
6192354999871400 Yikes, kid, why are you glaring at me like that?
6192354999871401 You do look like the Old Man. You could be his son.
6192354999871402 I <i>am</i> his son.
6192354999871403 What I wanna know is, why are you covered in blood?
6192354999871404 It's none of your business.
6192354999871405 Haven't you seen what the streets are like?
6192354999871406 …What's wrong with you, kid?
6192354999871407 Whatever… but I'll remember you.
6192354999871408 Likewise. Nice meeting you.
6192354999871409 My advice, kid? Watch your tongue.
6192354999871410 I didn't touch anything!
6192354999871411 …What are you doing here, weirdo?
6192354999871412 The hell… What's going on here?
6192354999871413 Oh… An old friend of mine, I see.
6192354999871414 Weirdo yourself. Can't you see? I'm working.
6192354999871415 …While not touching anything. Yes, I see.
6192354999871416 You mean you're training?
6192354999871417 Working on your lockpicking skills?
6192354999871418 Dogs need training. I need to get things done.
6192354999871419 I'm all ears.
6192354999871420 This looks suspicious.
6192354999871421 Well, I'm not leaving. You got that?
6192354999871422 I got it, I got it. Are you… catching rats, or something?
6192354999871423 Yes you are, if I want you to.
6192354999871424 Why are you yelling at me? Old Man and I, we used to do a lot of stuff here! I even figured out how to crystalize blue salt. Made extracts myself. You think I was just helping him? I know a lot of stuff!
6192354999871425 Aren't you a smart one.
6192354999871426 What is that thing on the table, then? Did you make it all by yourself, hmm?
6192354999871427 No need to be nasty.
6192354999871428 Mind your manners. What is that thing?
6192354999871429 Well, if you're the nice one here, go ahead and <i>kindly</i> tell me how you got in.
6192354999871430 It's a mixer. Old Man used to make medicine here. Like… tinctures, I think he called it. Extracts. From all kinds of gross stuff.
6192354999871431 So you know how to operate it?
6192354999871432 Easy. Someone needs to work the machine, after all, while the Old Man walks the steppe. So I volunteered. Our kind doesn't need keys.
6192354999871433 What is this machine anyway?
6192354999871434 So Father didn't give you a key after all! I thought you were an apprentice of his… but you're more like a cat.
6192354999871435 For some reason neither of them works. Can you fix them? And I'll… I'll do anything. Just don't make me go.
6192354999871436 Let's see. Perhaps I can fix them.
6192354999871437 All right, you little house imp. Stay. There's enough room for both of us here.
6192354999871438 Hey! You know, I can make a painkiller concoction all on my own! I can clean the machine! I can take it apart and put it back together, all the pieces!
6192354999871439 You mean this machine?
6192354999871457 Rise and shine! Don'tcha dare kick the bucket on me, lowlife. Round here, we die on our own terms, not by the hand of others.
6192354999871458 Where am I?
6192354999871459 Was I unconscious?
6192354999871460 Look, pal, this won't do. Gave up my own blanket to carry you. Guess what you did? …You coughed up blood all over it, asshole. You owe me a blanket now. A nice wool blanket. I wouldn't mind seein' a little spirit from you, either. Y'know what I mean?
6192354999871461 What happened to me?
6192354999871462 I don't have a blanket. I'll drag you here, too, if you're ever in trouble…?
6192354999871463 So there you are, dead as a doornail. Down we dive to pluck your teeth out, then—wow, turns out you're alive! And Crop over there says, don'tcha touch 'im, you vultures, he's Bad Grief's best friend since childhood! Well, Crop, this time, was not full of shit. Now Bad Grief's all happy, even rewarded us. Go ahead, say hello, he's over there.
6192354999871464 Bad Grief, huh… we used to be friends, true. Surprised he's still alive.
6192354999871465 Well, thank you.
6192354999871466 So he's your leader now? Took the low road, I see…
6192354999871467 You owe me a blanket. Got it? And a little gift for savin' you, somethin' top-shelf…
6192354999871468 I got it, I got it.
6192354999871469 Like hell.
6192354999871470 Since Bad Grief's so happy I'm here, ask him.
6192354999871471 In the Community. Be respectful, all right?
6192354999871472 I'm as respectful as it gets. How did I get here?
6192354999871475 Knives. Scissors. Blades. Razors. Anything sharp. If you've got a sharp axe, I'm interested.
6192354999871476 Getting armed and ready?
6192354999871477 How about sharp wit? It can cut deeper than a knife.
6192354999871478 Got a scalpel?
6192354999871479 Those items are what I barter for. We need them.
6192354999871481 And what would you give me for sharp objects?
6192354999871482 Lockpicking shivs. If you're handy with locks, you can open three or four doors with one. Brand new! And needles. Good for smaller locks. Like locker locks.
6192354999871483 So you trade needles for knives? Strange.
6192354999871489 Oh, so you aren't a local… We aren't allowed razors. If they catch us, we'll be grounded for a year. Might even get spanked!
6192354999871490 Nice try with the bullshit, but I'm not buying it. Razors aren't the only forbidden sharp objects. So where'd you get all those pins? Did you break into a tailor shop?
6192354999871491 I'm a local. I'm familiar with the law. Children aren't to touch sharp objects.
6192354999871495 Thank you, thank you for actually coming! You're so brave! Look, we all made a gift for you, to welcome you here. See? It's bread! Please don't frown… It's all we can spare. We need to eat, too. There's a lot of mouths to feed here.
6192354999871496 Why are you doing this?
6192354999871497 Thank you. When I get my house back, come visit. I'll return the favor.
6192354999871498 Sorry it's so stale! And drink the milk fast, because it'll go bad soon. But the water is fresh from a ravine!
6192354999871499 No, wait—keep this! Especially if you don't have much to give!
6192354999871500 So you kids are all hungry too?
6192354999871501 But you're a guest! Take it! Or else we'll get bad luck. We need luck more than food right now.
6192354999871502 Ugh… Okay, I understand. You poor souls. I'll take it. Thanks.
6192354999871503 If I start taking food from half-starved urchins, I'll be the one with bad luck. Forget it.
6192354999871504 Well, yeah. We are on our own, after all.
6192354999871505 I can't accept this gift.
6192354999871506 All right. Thanks for the gift, kids. It sure is timely.
6192354999871515 And you are…?
6192354999871516 Mind your own business. That guy over there… Piecework, I take it?
6192354999871517 A doctor. From Bad Grief. Tell me what happened.
6192354999871518 That's him, all right. You're one of our lot, then?
6192354999871519 Independent. Got water?
6192354999871520 One of ours got himself cut, is what happened! A shiv stuck in his side. Lot of blood, see? At least he's breathin' for now…
6192354999871521 Got water?
6192354999871522 No. Don'tcha forget to give him alcohol! Or powders, anything. Gotta kill the pain first. \nA twitchy man, this one. He'll flop around like a fish.
6192354999871523 "Powders"? …You have no idea how to perform an operation.
6192354999871524 Alcohol does nothing to reduce pain, idiot.
6192354999871526 But you got somethin' to cut with? That damned thing's stuck deep. Tried to get it out with a knife, didn't work. Need those special knives… scalpels?
6192354999871527 Yes, I see you're experts at poking around with knives. You probably started this whole mess, didn't you?
6192354999871528 Yes, idiots, I do have a scalpel. Now shut up so I can work.
6192354999871529 No! We were doin' God's work. Who did away with old Burakh? A shabnak, that's who. So we tracked the maneater!\nThen all the steppe trash poured in, yelling that she's no shabnak. They took out shivs… ten of 'em on two!
6192354999871530 You slaughtered a living woman?!
6192354999871531 What shabnak? What are you on about?
6192354999871532 I've seen the Stake Lot fire. Was that your doing, too?
6192354999871533 A shabnak. The shabnak. A steppe creature, belched out by Earth. Not a local, are you? \nA shabnak's not human, but clay and bone. Bones taken from clay, I mean. As in, from below. Looks like a steppe girl, but it limps on both legs.
6192354999871534 Have you lost your mind? Whom did you kill?
6192354999871535 We avenged Burakh. Piecework himself grabbed her. \nDon'tcha glare at me like that! C'mon, help the man! Can'tcha see he's about dead? Do what Bad Grief said. Some doctor he's sent us…
6192354999871536 Shut up. I'm on it.
6192354999871537 Bad Grief told me to search his stomach for anything he doesn't need. So that's what I'll look for.
6192354999871538 Hey, I can hear him breathin' now… all normal!
6192354999871539 What is this… splinter?
6192354999871540 He'll live. Unless he dies.
6192354999871541 You're clearly not from around here. This is a local tradition. We don't keep knives—they might call it <i>cutlery,</i> but it sure ain't for cuttin'.\nGodless beasts, who fear neither life nor death, make these… disposables. You jab once, then it breaks. All about observing the custom.
6192354999871542 I'm from around here. I know about the custom.
6192354999871543 The custom has nothing to do with breaking shivs, asshole. It's about not cutting bodies—at all!
6192354999871544 What? What have you done? You monster!
6192354999871545 I did what I was told. I cut out anything he didn't need.
6192354999871546 I've just gotten started. You're next. So what will it be? You can lie down on your own, or I can help you lie down.
6192354999871913 So what, is the asshole still in there? The one with the carpet bag?
6192354999871914 Watch your tongue, boy. Though I do agree with you.
6192354999871915 Yeah, he's in there. I hereby grant you every right to throw something at him, if you so desire.
6192354999871916 But where's Doctor Rubin? We need a doctor!
6192354999871917 Rubin isn't here, kids! We got zero Rubins left in stock.
6192354999871918 That obnoxious dandy is a doctor. A well-trained one, I suspect.
6192354999871919 I'm a doctor. What's the issue?
6192354999871920 There's been a disaster! Alma, Duke, and Wolfling were poisoned!
6192354999871921 Where are they?
6192354999871922 Sorry, poisons are not my area of expertise. I deal in broken jaws, cracked ribs… That kind of thing.
6192354999871923 A doctor, my ass! We tried talking to him already, and he just shooed us away…
6192354999871924 He was probably right. You're obviously up to no good…
6192354999871925 What! Has he forgotten the Hippocratic Oath? I should give him a firm reminder…
6192354999871926 In a warehouse with little flags! Go down the railroad and to the left. You'll see it.
6192354999871927 Lead the way.
6192354999871928 All right, I'll check it out.
6192354999871929 I have enough on my plate right now, kids. Try to find Rubin.
6192354999871930 I can't. We need to go to a drugstore, and find bones, and a whistle, and a shovel! Or Notkin'll bite our heads off. You'll find the place on your own, it's easy.
6192354999871931 Bones and a whistle are your cure for poison? Well, good luck with that.
6192354999871932 I will, I know that warehouse.
6192354999871933 You're the man everybody's after, right? You look like the description…
6192354999871934 I'm not. And I don't.
6192354999871935 The one and only.
6192354999871936 Oh? What's the description?
6192354999871937 Really? Well, whatever… It's good we found you. We need help!
6192354999871938 What for?
6192354999871939 Not from me. Go home, girl.
6192354999871940 We need to hold a trial for a murderer. And we can't do it without you. Will you help?
6192354999871941 Hold a trial? You kids play funny games.
6192354999871942 The fastest judge in town is camping out at Rubin's place. Go see him. Cheers.
6192354999871943 What? You've caught a murderer? Or was it <i>the</i> murderer?
6192354999871944 It's not a game, it's for real! Notkin said, "If you see him, drag him over." He also said, "Or else we'll choose the punishment on our own, and it won't end well."
6192354999871945 This is blackmail.
6192354999871946 Fine. Where's the courthouse?
6192354999871947 The courthouse is a warehouse. The one with little flags. Hurry up, they're starting soon!
6192354999871948 The warehouse with little flags? Oh, I remember… Seems like you kids took over our old place.
6192354999871949 You'll figure it out without me. I'm a bad judge.
6192354999871950 It's kinda hard to say… So, will you come?
6192354999871951 Let's go.
6192354999871952 Well, if you're telling the truth, then I'm in luck.
6192354999871953 You know… Big, fat, dangerous, with bulgy eyes, a weird leg, a scary mug, and a stupid look on his face. Must be you.
6192354999871954 Thanks, kid. At least I know what I look like now.
6192354999871955 My expression isn't stupid, kid. It's bewildered and confused.
6192354999871956 Black… mail? Where?
6192354999871957 Here. You're all just trying to pressure me into something. Home sweet home, I guess.
6192354999871958 Forget it. If I'm around, I'll drop by. Maybe I'll get there in time to hear the verdict.
6192354999871959 There… Locked shut. Won't let anyone in. Not that I object… There must be order. And so, it was ordered.
6192354999871960 What are you all waiting for? Me?
6192354999871961 Our house was locked? Who ordered that?
6192354999871962 What happened? Spit it out!
6192354999871963 So you're Burakh's son, then? The one who left town so long ago? You missed him by hours… Guess it wasn't in the cards. \nCouldn't you have gotten here, say, yesterday? Everything would be different then. And he waited for you so eagerly…
6192354999871964 Get on with it! What happened?
6192354999871965 I know. I got here as fast as I could. So where's Father?
6192354999871966 Saburov, of course. The governor.
6192354999871967 And where did my father go?
6192354999871968 Old Burakh is dead.
6192354999871969 …Dead?!
6192354999871970 No. It can't be.
6192354999871971 Dead. No one knows how. Rumor has it, he was murdered. A load of bull. He was like a father to all of us. Who would kill him? I don't buy it.
6192354999871972 Neither do I.
6192354999871973 So that's who was killed tonight.
6192354999871974 Guess your best wasn't good enough.
6192354999871975 What do you mean?
6192354999871976 The crowd's gone mad… like frightened children. So eager to catch someone, anyone—and no idea who. Some say it was an outsider. Others, a shabnak. When it hits home, people are quick to drag the clay wench from the depths of memory.
6192354999871977 What clay wench?
6192354999871978 Why an outsider?
6192354999871979 A shabnak-adyr. A thing of steppe legends.
6192354999871980 Yes, I know about it.
6192354999871981 I don't recall what it is.
6192354999871982 Earth is living. In the wake of great change, wrath, pain, fear, anxiety—all these grow in its belly, until one day it disgorges a creature of clay and dead bones. \nIt often looks like a woman. And the longer it walks among us, the more it looks like a living person.
6192354999871983 Bullshit. Old wives' tales.
6192354999871984 And you think a shabnak killed my father?
6192354999871985 Well, maybe the killer was a shabnak. Who else? A person couldn't have done it.
6192354999871986 You think so?
6192354999871987 People are capable of anything. Father says… used to say… this often.
6192354999871988 Isidor was a man. Men must not kill men, and so, men do not kill men. At least not in this town, they don't.
6192354999871989 Obviously they do now.
6192354999871990 Maybe you're right.
6192354999871991 Bullshit.
6192354999871992 Who else?
6192354999871993 I don't know. But I'll find out.
6192354999871994 And a… shabnak? Honestly, you're hardly better than a pack of children.
6192354999871995 Oh, but of course he wasn't <i>killed.</i> People are mad with grief, so they parrot nonsense. And Saburov, he's only too happy to prey on these rumors.\nHe'll dig his claws deep into this case to flaunt his value, mark my words.
6192354999871996 Saburov? So he's in charge now?
6192354999871997 A domineering leader, then?
6192354999871998 Well, yes and no… The real ruler is Fat Vlad. Money's power, and the Town's business all belongs to Olgimsky. The Factory, the Abattoir, the railroad: all his. \nThe Kains still have the power of fear. And Saburov, well, he's technically the leader of the three. But only technically.
6192354999871999 So now he's showing off his value?
6192354999872000 Where's my father's body?
6192354999872001 Tell me about it. Obviously it isn't murder. But he's given the order to seize anyone who might be even remotely suspicious. If I were you, I wouldn't go to Saburov…\nAlthough, he did take the key. And you probably want to pay your last respects to your father. He was taken by Saburov's men.
6192354999872002 Where?
6192354999872003 No clue. People used to bring the dead to your father… You know, a doctor. How will we live now? No idea.\nUnbelievable. The war, the train delayed… What a terrible year! Do you even have a place to stay now?
6192354999872004 Yes. I have friends in town. Three, at least. They'll help me.
6192354999872005 I'll go to Saburov. Although, given all this… maybe it's not a good idea.
6192354999872006 I don't need to go anywhere. I'm home.
6192354999872007 Look! See, everyone? The doctor is here!
6192354999872008 Why do you think I'm a doctor?
6192354999872009 Who's sick?
6192354999872010 So you've found the murderer, huh? And I've heard there will be a trial?
6192354999872011 We've been looking for a doctor since morning. What other reason would a grown-up have for coming here?
6192354999872012 Tell me about your problem.
6192354999872013 You're too late! They died! Why didn't you come sooner? <i>What kind of doctor are you?</i>
6192354999872014 Three kids are dead and no one gives a damn?!
6192354999872015 I've been asking myself that question all day…
6192354999872016 Not kids. Worse. Those were our dogs. Alma, Wolfling, and Duke…
6192354999872017 Who poisoned them?
6192354999872018 I'm sorry to hear that. I'm a dog person myself.
6192354999872019 Ugh! And here I was thinking…
6192354999872020 Somebody evil. Notkin's planning on holding a trial… He wanted you to be there, too.
6192354999872021 Well, at least I made it in time for the trial. Not all is lost.
6192354999872022 Oh, come on. This is a waste of my time.
6192354999872023 Of course we did. Took us two hours.
6192354999872024 Where are they?
6192354999872025 Ask Notkin. He's waiting for you. Said it's trial first, punishment after.
6192354999872026 What about the victims? I was told someone was poisoned?
6192354999872027 Is Notkin the one on the crate? Got it, thanks.
6192354999872028 That traitor Lika saw you this morning, by the way. How you got off the train, and beat those thugs to a pulp…
6192354999872029 Huh! So I have a living, breathing witness…
6192354999872030 Well, I hope he turns this undying legend into a song when he grows up.
6192354999872031 Not for long. He's doomed.
6192354999872032 We'll see about that.
6192354999872033 Yeah? How come?
6192354999872034 He killed Duke, Wolfling, and Alma. Notkin will punish him for that.
6192354999872035 Don't you need to make sure he's the real culprit first? I'm speaking from experience, here.
6192354999872036 Not so fast. I need him to confirm my alibi first.
6192354999872037 And not only them, it seems. No way. I'll punish him myself.
6192354999872078 Don't go in there, buddy. If you do, you won't come out.
6192354999872079 I'll risk it.
6192354999872080 Why not?
6192354999872081 Although… at least they'd feed you in jail. You'd have a chance to rest and wait it out until the birds stop squawking and return to their nests.
6192354999872082 What birds?
6192354999872083 A poet, then. No wonder no one's seized you.
6192354999872084 Because Saburov will seize you first, just like he did the rest, and investigate your guilt later.
6192354999872085 I know what I'm guilty of, and it's not what he's worried about.
6192354999872086 Thanks for the advice.
6192354999872087 People are like flocks of birds. When the earth shakes or the wind howls, they startle and squawk. Some frightened, while others parrot and echo…\nWho started it? Why? Where does the wind blow from? When will it end? No one decides this. The flock doesn't think, it just listens—and only to itself.
6192354999872088 I know. Hysteria's the same in the north.
6192354999872089 Yes, I remember. Our town's like this.
6192354999872090 …So you're a trained surgeon? Good… This is good. Shame that your esteemed degree is of no help to me.
6192354999872091 Why is that?
6192354999872092 What do you need, gramps?
6192354999872093 I don't have a degree. The war snatched away my chance to graduate.
6192354999872094 The Kin has not accepted you yet. You are Burakh's son, but sharing blood is not enough. Supposedly you're a menkhu by birth, but in truth, you aren't.\nYou went away to study who knows where, leaving your people behind. Old folk don't appreciate that. Will the Kin accept you at all?
6192354999872095 A menkhu… Does this word mean anything to any of you still?
6192354999872096 I'm not a steppe man. But I do know that among your lot, only menkhus can become butchers, wise men, or surgeons. Because they know the Lines. \nIs that what you call it? The art of understanding the world? The Lines?
6192354999872097 Yes. The Lines.
6192354999872098 Those are ancient beliefs of a dying people. No one takes them seriously anymore.
6192354999872099 Your father did. And he was a wise man in every meaning of the word. Not just a doctor. A truly wise man.
6192354999872100 Will you all just leave my father alone!
6192354999872101 Father… was very attached to tradition. But what is gone, is gone.
6192354999872102 That's even better.
6192354999872103 How is it better?
6192354999872104 No, old man, it's not better. I'm a nobody.
6192354999872105 How do I put it? I have a certain need. But now that Old Burakh is dead, no one can help me out. Including his son. Don't even offer.
6192354999872106 Why can't I help?
6192354999872107 I wasn't planning to.
6192354999872108 …And that's why you and I have nothing to talk about yet. You may know how to wield a scalpel, but you don't know the Lines. \nAnd in this town, no one would trust you to cut a body before you comprehend the world's design. So you can't help me out.
6192354999872109 Who are you anyway?
6192354999872110 Spare me your troubles, old man. I've got enough of my own.
6192354999872111 I'm Var. I have… a business. An unusual one. Your father used to deliver… certain goods to me. \nNow I came to ask Bad Grief… He's a bandit, after all, a law unto himself. But turns out, he's too lily-livered to cross this particular boundary…
6192354999872112 What kind of business?
6192354999872113 You must be asking wrong then. I've known Bad Grief since we were kids—there is no boundary he wouldn't jump over. So talk to him, not me.
6192354999872114 I buy blood. And organs. Body components. Human components.
6192354999872115 …What for?
6192354999872116 You're no menkhu. You wouldn't understand. Forget it.
6192354999872117 Forgotten already.
6192354999872118 Show me where you live. I want to talk to you about the Kin some more.
6192354999872119 Ah… It's you. Did you come to talk about your father?
6192354999872120 Yes. Did you know him?
6192354999872121 No. I brought you something, old man. Is this what you needed?
6192354999872122 So you dared… But you're not ready yet. You're trying to put the cart before the horse. It will get you into trouble.
6192354999872123 I'm a daring sort. So are you taking this or not?
6192354999872124 I'm not as hasty as you think. First, tell me why you need this.
6192354999872125 I did. But that's not what someone as clueless as you should addle their brain about. You left this town as a boy. You never really knew it, and even those scraps are lost and forgotten now. Educate yourself. Breathe in the twyre-soaked air. Get to know elders.\nHurry not, Burakh. Achieve respect. Then you'll have your answers.
6192354999872126 Heard you loud and clear, old man. Var, is it?
6192354999872127 But I do have to hurry. Look, I brought you something.
6192354999872128 I won't. You're not a real menkhu yet. You won't understand.\nIf you choose to rush headlong into this, I'm not the one to judge. And I will accept the goods. But it's not my job to educate you.
6192354999872129 Then you can't have the goods.
6192354999872130 I need coin. Take it.
6192354999872134 Who are you? What do you want?
6192354999872135 This place smells of blood.
6192354999872136 I'm Artemy Burakh.
6192354999872137 Burakh is dead. And what the fuck do you want, Artemy the Nameless?
6192354999872138 Just dropping by.
6192354999872139 Watch your tongue, old man. I'm Burakh's son.
6192354999872140 Who sent you?
6192354999872141 I'm on my own.
6192354999872142 I'm Isidor Burakh's son.
6192354999872143 Did you bring me blood, Isidor Burakh's son?
6192354999872144 Do you buy it?
6192354999872145 Either give me the goods or get lost.
6192354999872146 What goods are you interested in these days?
6192354999872147 I think getting lost is my preferred option here.
6192354999872148 Day blood. Kidneys, spleens, hearts. No longer than two hundred minutes on the ice. And don't try to swindle me.
6192354999872149 Huh… That's some unusual trade you have.
6192354999872150 Got it. I'll be sure to drop by if I have any.
6192354999872151 How much?
6192354999872152 I think I'll tell on you leeches to the governor. Then again, you two probably conspire.
6192354999872153 I'll tell you when I see it.
6192354999872154 Fair enough.
6192354999872155 These things don't come cheap.
6192354999872156 Emshen, brave man. Strong is his spirit. How fares your kine, emshen? Bite kharaan, for he has come to pay last respects to his father. We have, too.
6192354999872157 How fares your kine, Khatangher?
6192354999872158 Bayarlaa, thank you. Why is my father still unburied?
6192354999872159 Bite kharaan, ubshe is at the threshold. The loss is great. A need to speak, to say the words correct. Observe the rite.
6192354999872160 I've come to pay last respects to my father. Why do I see this sight?
6192354999872161 Khodo khara, Burakh-esegher carried a great burden. Owed a great debt. Who is to take his duty upon himself?
6192354999872162 I'm not here for his duties. I need to inspect his wounds.
6192354999872163 Be khara, it's not that easy. What does he owe?
6192354999872164 Before the eyes of the Kin and the Earth, this is what I have to say: I, his son, accept his duty as my own. The Sky is my witness.
6192354999872165 A bow for you, emshen. The first blood yours. Be khara, emshen is a man. A brave man.\nHere stands Sahba, Sabha Usp'tae. You have accepted his duty. Now, come into the inheritance. Sahba will show you the way.
6192354999872166 Bayartai, khyn. Thank you.
6192354999872167 Bayarlaa. I have done what needed to be done. There was no choice.
6192354999872168 Yes. I have just done a brave deed.
6192354999872169 You've gone wrong, emshen. You stumble wrong. Be khara, you knew not what you came for, so you welcome the wrong guest. Say now: do you accept his duty as your own?
6192354999872170 Be tatgalzah. I don't. I can't.
6192354999872171 Before the eyes of the Kin and the Earth, this is what I have to say: I, his son, accept his duty as my own. The Sky is my witness.
6192354999872172 He told us not, emshen; he took it to the grave. You ask the wrong people. Too late, emshen, now. The Earth waits. Say now: do you accept his duty as your own?
6192354999872173 Be tatgalzah. I don't. I can't.
6192354999872174 Before the eyes of the Kin and the Earth, this is what I have to say: I, his son, accept his duty as my own. The Sky is my witness.
6192354999872175 Wait. I want to take a look at the body first.
6192354999872176 Be khara, emshen is cautious. Who is it will judge him? If the Earth shall not take Burakh-esegher, let us burn him.
6192354999872177 Whatever. I just want to be finished with this.
6192354999872178 …No. This isn't right. Before the eyes of the Kin and the Earth, this is what I have to say: I, his son, accept his duty as my own. The Sky is my witness.
6192354999872179 Many soon will leave. Hurry, emshen.
6192354999872180 Wait here.
6192354999872181 Wait here for you, yes. Say now: do you accept what he owes?
6192354999872182 Be tatgalzah. I don't. I can't.
6192354999872183 Before the eyes of the Kin and the Earth, this is what I have to say: I, his son, accept his duty as my own. The Sky is my witness.
6192354999872212 …Yet it had to be done. A cruel deed, but necessary. An inoculation.
6192354999872213 Father! Can you hear me?
6192354999872214 …No need for repentance, nor confessions. I should have done it five years ago, during the First Outbreak. I wasn't brave enough. It was spreading like wildfire.
6192354999872215 Father! Who murdered you?
6192354999872216 Father, what did you owe? Why did the Earth expel you?
6192354999872217 Father, who are you talking to? It's me, Artemy. Your son.
6192354999872218 No need for fear, either. Death is not the worst fate for a man, nor a town, for that matter. To earn their right to live, one must first pass the trial of death. I have only recently realized that, but it's true. Tell that to the Kin.
6192354999872219 You're talking to someone else…
6192354999872220 Did I do the right thing today? Did I choose the right path?
6192354999872221 I'm sorry I was late. I tried. But… I didn't try hard enough. I'm sorry.
6192354999872222 …It will be difficult, and terrible. My heart aches for those who will fail the trial. Some will die. Many will. And yet, we couldn't keep living the old way. How did we differ from animals? That's nature: Only the strong survive.
6192354999872223 What are you talking about?
6192354999872224 What happened five years ago?
6192354999872225 You don't need to explain yourself to anyone!
6192354999872226 …Yes, it sounds cruel. The words of tyrants who start wars and reform countries. But we're talking about nature. We can't just lock the door when it knocks. We must face it, proving our right to live on this earth.
6192354999872227 Just know that I… I respect you, and love you.
6192354999872228 I won't let you down.
6192354999872229 Forgive me.
6192354999872230 …Especially since there will be no rest… Not ever.
6192354999872231 The rest is silence.
6192354999872232 …All right. I understand.
6192354999872233 Indeed, there won't be.
6192354999872234 Hey, big guy! No loitering. Keep walking.
6192354999872235 What's going on?
6192354999872236 What do you mean, no loitering? This is my house!
6192354999872237 Was there another murder?
6192354999872238 By the order of Governor Saburov, entrance is by permit only. If you want in so badly, go to the Town Hall and get one.
6192354999872239 What's this stuff in the air?
6192354999872240 Go to Saburov for help? I'd rather go to hell.
6192354999872241 I bet there was an accident at the plant. A fire, or a pipe burst, who knows…Now all this soot is pouring out, and the plant is dead in the water.\nExplains why the Termitary's on lockdown when there isn't any work to do. No sense in letting them roam the streets. An accident—what else could it be?
6192354999872242 So you think this is factory soot, huh?
6192354999872243 Something stinks here.
6192354999872244 Accident or not, let me in!
6192354999872245 Take a look at this grimy air. Sticky and thick, like snot… If I were you I'd get out of here right now. Me and my pal have been standing here for a couple hours already, and we're sick as hell from it. Damned shift change can't come soon enough.
6192354999872246 I need to get inside.
6192354999872247 Come back with a stamped permit from Saburov and we'll let you in. While you're at it, get him to send in another shift!
6192354999872248 You can rot here for all I care.
6192354999872249 I have better things to do.
6192354999872256 Now everyone acknowledges you. Everyone says you have embarked upon the path of your father.\nMake it so they unlock the Termitary. Bite kharaan, something's off about it. Trouble must be brewing.
6192354999872257 What trouble?
6192354999872258 It's not in my power.
6192354999872259 We don't know. Make them tell us. Make them open the Termitary.
6192354999872260 Make who? Fat Vlad? He won't listen.
6192354999872261 Gonna ask me to grant three wishes, too?
6192354999872262 Everyone says you're now a menkhu. Once you're allowed to cut bodies, cut my brother, please. Release him of evil meat, so he may speak.
6192354999872263 I'm not a menkhu yet, but I'm working on it.
6192354999872264 Menkhu? What does that mean?
6192354999872265 When will I be allowed to do that?
6192354999872266 How can you not know? Be khara, you're laughing at me. A menkhu knows the body's Lines. A menkhu knows the composition of everything.
6192354999872267 When I know everything, your grandchildren will be grandparents.
6192354999872268 The elders will say when. Can we bring my brother to you? Will you cut away his pain?
6192354999872269 Sure.
6192354999872270 If I myself live to see that fine moment.
6192354999872271 You were unjustly suspected yesterday, but now everyone believes you. My sister is about to give birth. The older women say the child is big, she is small, and so she will die if not helped. Will you help her?
6192354999872272 I will. Bring her here when her water breaks.
6192354999872273 Where did you all even come from…
6192354999872274 Hate to break it to ya, big fella, but we don't let just anyone in.
6192354999872275 What do you want, a password?
6192354999872276 I'm here to speak to Khan.
6192354999872277 Nah, no passwords. All I want is an answer to a simple question. No strings attached.
6192354999872278 Ask away.
6192354999872279 Go ahead. I could use one of those lately.
6192354999872280 Are you older than eighteen?
6192354999872281 Obviously.
6192354999872282 Is this a joke? I'm almost thirty.
6192354999872283 Just as I thought. Fuck off, big fella. We're sixteen and under here. Tried to cut you a little slack what with your size, but this won't do.
6192354999872284 That's a bit harsh, don't you think?
6192354999872285 At least tell me… What's inside?
6192354999872286 I'm looking for a kid who goes by "Khan."
6192354999872287 Those are the rules. The Tower is all ours, no adults allowed.
6192354999872288 So, the Tower is chock full of kids?
6192354999872289 Khan? What do you want with him?
6192354999872290 Wanted to meet him.
6192354999872291 Important business.
6192354999872292 It's him who wants to meet me, not the other way around.
6192354999872293 We'd know if he wanted to see you. Know why you're all grown up? 'cause you forgot how to lie! There's an art to it.
6192354999872294 Got me there. Never been a good liar.
6192354999872295 I'm not getting in, am I?
6192354999872296 We got some space left. There's only seven hundred of us.
6192354999872297 What do you even do in there?
6192354999872298 Holy shit! Are you sure it won't fall?
6192354999872299 You're asking too many questions.
6192354999872300 To hell with these games. Tell Khan I said hi.
6192354999872301 Whatever. See you weirdos later.
6192354999872323 This place is on lockdown. Move along.
6192354999872324 Why?
6192354999872325 Let me through. I have the right to be here.
6192354999872326 I live there.
6192354999872327 What do you want?
6192354999872328 I need to talk to a certain girl. Taya Tycheek. Do you know her?
6192354999872329 Come on, let me in.
6192354999872330 If you want to bother someone, go do it at the pub. Or are you looking for trouble? We can help you out.
6192354999872331 Maybe we can strike a deal? A hundred coins, right now.
6192354999872332 Maybe I am.
6192354999872333 Go ahead and offer them to Fat Vlad if you're so smart. He's got plenty of room for coins. The man shits money. As for me, I like my head attached to my shoulders, thank you very much. So get out of here. Enough talk.
6192354999872334 Whatever.
6192354999872335 Fat Vlad, huh? There's a thought.
6192354999872336 We're not paid to ask questions. We're paid to stop people going in and out.
6192354999872337 Why are they screaming?
6192354999872338 I'd hate to have your job.
6192354999872339 Move along.
6192354999872340 This isn't the end of it.
6192354999872341 Keep your shirt on, soldier. Don't want to lose it.
6192354999872342 The orders were clear—no one's getting in under any circumstances.
6192354999872343 No means no. Got it.
6192354999872344 Why are they screaming?
6192354999872345 You got yourself infected with sand pest, Cub. Our dogs found you.
6192354999872346 Sand pest?
6192354999872347 Did I faint?
6192354999872348 Sand pest. That's what it's like. It struck once before, five years ago. A lot of people died. We used to play the plague game then, too…
6192354999872349 Five years ago, you say…?
6192354999872351 …So what, do you want to play more?
6192354999872355 It's deadly… Spreads like fire. Transmitted through touch. It infects items. Walls, drawers. The ground itself. It clings to you like mud…
6192354999872356 Like leprosy?
6192354999872357 Uh huh. Next you're going to tell me madness is contagious.
6192354999872358 It's in the air, too. If a sick person touches you, you can catch it. It's like smoke… Like a fog. If you breathe in infected air, you might get sick.
6192354999872359 I've seen that air.
6192354999872360 Unlikely. Few diseases are transmitted both ways.
6192354999872361 Here, have an immunity pill. So that you don't faint anymore. All right? Notkin gave us some, but you need it more.\nIt suppresses all kinds of diseases. It also tingles on your tongue.
6192354999872363 What about you?
6192354999872367 We're small. A single pill can last me a day. But I'm actually very healthy—my belly never even aches!
6192354999872369 Fine. Hand your pills over.
6192354999872951 
6192354999872952 Georgiy Kain plans to take my home for himself. If only I remembered where exactly he lives…
6192354999872953 I was summoned back to my hometown by a distressing letter from my father. I should hurry home.
6192354999872954 …Where do I go now?
6192354999872955 I need to find the people who still remember me. Who will believe me without proof. Who can vouch for me.
6192354999872956 I think I've done all I could for today. Now all that remains is to wait until the coast is clear.
6192354999872957 Anyone is free to take anything in the houses contaminated by odd black smog.
6192354999872958 
6192354999872959 Someone important was murdered tonight.
6192354999872960 My rights to the house have been restored.
6192354999872961 
6192354999872962 Home, sweet home welcomed me with its knives honed. What does this mean?
6192354999872963 There is a familiar name on Father's list.
6192354999872964 Capella has created a union of kids. She might know what Father wanted with them.
6192354999872965 In his letter, Father wrote that he will face a difficult trial. Or did he write "we"? I don't remember…
6192354999872966 
6192354999872967 
6192354999872968 I met a funny dog-eared kid at the Station. What was he doing there?
6192354999872969 Home sweet home is locked. The local authorities must have the key. I can't keep pretending it doesn't concern me.
6192354999872970 
6192354999872971 The dog killer is the doghead who saw me at dawn. He could testify to my alibi. \n\nBut I gave Notkin my word. The murderer will be tried.
6192354999872972 The dog killer is the doghead who saw me at dawn. He could testify to my alibi. But I like dogs, and he's disgusting. Let him go to hell.\n\nI wonder what Notkin will think of this.
6192354999872973 The dog killer is the doghead who saw me at dawn. He will testify to my alibi. We'll meet by the Town Hall.\n\nI wonder what Notkin will think of this.
6192354999872974 
6192354999872975 It's been foretold I will "spill a river of blood" soon. Guess someone will find their death under my knife, after all.
6192354999872976 Three poisoned patients are in a warehouse we used to play in when we were kids. They seem to require medical help.
6192354999872977 
6192354999872978 Murky was unhelpful. I can probably still see what Grace is doing until the dawn breaks. Not sure it's a good idea, though.
6192354999872979 The local urchins have found and are trying a murderer! Could it be…?
6192354999872980 
6192354999872981 
6192354999872982 The Soul-and-a-Halves want to punish the culprit who poisoned their dogs. But I don't want them to do something they'll regret for the rest of their lives.
6192354999872983 The Soul-and-a-Halves want to punish the culprit who poisoned their dogs. Well, it's their vengeance to deliver.
6192354999872984 
6192354999872985 Barter is not only a way to obtain useful items, but a way to get closer to people. Everyone has something of their own to share.
6192354999872986 What have they done to him? …Do I really want to know? What matters is, I think I have new allies now.
6192354999872987 What a twist. I robbed the Soul-and-a-Halves of their revenge… but somehow they're thankful for this.
6192354999872988 Seems like the local urchins need assistance.
6192354999872989 The Soul-and-a-Halves want to punish the culprit who poisoned their dogs. But I don't want them to do something they'll regret for the rest of their lives.
6192354999872990 Alexander Saburov, the Town's governor, is in charge of the investigation. I remember him. A stern man.
6192354999872991 I've yet to seriously barter with any men, women, or teenagers.
6192354999872992 I've yet to seriously barter with any men or women.
6192354999872993 The dog-eared boy didn't come. No witness. As expected.
6192354999872994 I've yet to seriously barter with any women, or any teenagers, either.
6192354999872995 I've yet to seriously barter with any women, or any kids, either.
6192354999872996 Seems like Saburov isn't inclined to listen to any explanations. He'll just throw me in jail, no questions asked. Should I still risk it…?
6192354999872997 I've yet to seriously barter with any men.
6192354999872998 I've yet to seriously barter with any women.
6192354999872999 I should listen to well-intentioned advice next time… Or should I?
6192354999873000 I've bartered with most elements of the Town. Now they'll accept me as their own.
6192354999873001 
6192354999873002 Father's dead. I was too late.
6192354999873003 I need the stems of black, bloody, and brown twyre, and swevery.
6192354999873004 I need the stems of black, bloody, and brown twyre.
6192354999873005 Shabnak-adyr, a clay golem of local legends, steals the shape of a young woman.
6192354999873006 I need the stems of black and brown twyre, and swevery.
6192354999873007 I need the stems of bloody and brown twyre, and swevery.
6192354999873008 They couldn't suspect me of patricide, could they? Of course not. Impossible.
6192354999873009 I need the stems of black and brown twyre.
6192354999873010 I need the stems of bloody and brown twyre.
6192354999873011 Could Father have been killed by the very thing that made him summon me so urgently? It's possible…
6192354999873012 I need the stems of bloody twyre, and swevery.
6192354999873013 I need the stems of brown twyre, and swevery.
6192354999873014 Lara Ravel lives by the river, in a house called the Shelter. We used to be friends when were kids. Hopefully, she will at least let me sleep at her place.
6192354999873015 Now I only need the stem of bloody twyre.
6192354999873016 Now I only need the stem of brown twyre.
6192354999873017 Lara's Shelter is now my shelter. She's not as happy to see me as I hoped. Still, I can stay at her place.
6192354999873018 I've collected all the herbs. 
6192354999873019 
6192354999873020 Lara says there's a thief in her house.
6192354999873021 An odd guest visited Lara's house. I'm not superstitious, but I feel that she's not entirely human.
6192354999873022 To hell with it. Now is not the time to get misty-eyed with old friends.
6192354999873023 
6192354999873024 Lara told her neighbors that I'm innocent. The inhabitants of the nearby districts won't attack me anymore.
6192354999873025 So we've met. Can't say any of us are eager to meet again soon. Lara is alive and well, and that's good enough.
6192354999873026 
6192354999873027 It's been foretold I will "spill a river of blood" soon. Guess someone will find their death under my knife, after all.
6192354999873028 I invited Rubin to gather our childhood gang again. I wonder if he'll come.
6192354999873029 
6192354999873030 I'm not even sure there was a girl. Am I seeing things?
6192354999873031 Whoever it was, she won't bother Lara anymore. Clearly I'm her new target.
6192354999873032 Bad Grief doesn't seem interested in the old friendship. His loss! I'm not going to be some mother hen, rounding them all up.
6192354999873033 
6192354999873034 Rubin is my father's student. Almost a brother to me. I should see him. He will help.
6192354999873035 Lara, Bad Grief, Rubin, and I are meeting after dark in the old place, where we burned that fire for the first time. I hope we can connect again.
6192354999873036 We were planning to gather our childhood gang at the old place, but now is not a good time for nostalgia. I guess I should apologize to Lara.
6192354999873037 An out-of-town dandy kindly informed me that Stakh considers me a patricide. Madness. I guess it's for the best I missed him.
6192354999873038 Perhaps old friendships can be mended… but our lives will never be the same again.
6192354999873039 Perhaps old friendships can be mended, but even that doesn't seem to work out… In any case, our lives will never be the same again.
6192354999873040 Redhead Grigory Filin, aka Bad Grief, always goads me into doing crazy stunts. We used to have a secret lair in a warehouse.
6192354999873041 
6192354999873042 Some evenings, kids gather at the Station.
6192354999873043 Today, Bad Grief's mob is willing to drag me out of trouble—a warm welcome. Tomorrow, though, I doubt they'll be as welcoming. The mob's hospitality doesn't last long.
6192354999873044 
6192354999873045 Sometimes after dark, steppe people meet at Sahba's place… and not just them.
6192354999873046 One of Grief's boys got stabbed. I promised to take a look at his wounded belly. Just gotta remember to bring a scalpel.
6192354999873047 
6192354999873048 The door locked behind us. According to the legend, I need to inspect the house and light up all candles I can find. Or wait until dawn.
6192354999873049 Bad Grief's henchmen were looking for a shabnak… by testing women with fire. That's what Piecework got his just deserts for.
6192354999873050 
6192354999873051 I lit up the final candle, and the door did open. Whatever it was, it's gone now. Now I need to grab the boys and leave this place.
6192354999873052 I'm a man of my word. The surgery is done, the shiv is out.
6192354999873053 That scum had neither heart nor brains, so he has no need for his guts, either. \n\nI'm a man of my word. I said I'd cut out anything he didn't need, so I did.
6192354999873054 I can't run from my fears forever. Sooner or later I'll have to take a look at Father's house.
6192354999873055 Day 1
6192354999873056 Bad Grief remembers me—while I'm useful, anyway. Not that he's of much help...
6192354999873057 A surgeon is not the kind of man to mess with, and Bad Grief was reminded of that. But he can't help my situation...
6192354999873058 Father is dead. The townsfolk treat me like a criminal. Where do I go now?
6192354999873059 Calm down. Collect my thoughts. I need to find the people who still remember me. Who will believe me without proof. Who can vouch for me.
6192354999873060 This Var claims to have done business with my father. He buys organs. \n\nBut I'm no menkhu. The local tradition does not allow me to cut bodies open.
6192354999873061 The high and the mighty of this town have finally taken notice of a Burakh. The witch hunt is over. I can now go out safely.
6192354999873062 I'm done with everything important for today. I'm free to rest until tomorrow… or explore the Town. At night, its face changes.
6192354999873063 I've broken a steppe taboo. I have cut a body open. This town does not provide the best working environment for a surgeon.
6192354999873064 
6192354999873065 Someone important was murdered tonight.
6192354999873066 Organs and hot blood—on a counter, just like that. If anyone finds out, I'm a dead man. But Var… he pays.

6192354999916356 I came into my legacy… sort of. I traced Father's path. I tried to take care of his patients… unsuccessfully. \n\nBut everyone still considers me a menkhu now.
6192354999916357 
6192354999916358 Father's funeral starts at dawn. And I doubt it will take all day.
6192354999916359 Father's funeral starts at dawn. And I doubt it will take all day.
6192354999916360 If I don't hurry, Father will be laid to rest… in the wrong way.
6192354999916361 Olgimsky's heir spends his days in a pub called the Broken Heart.

6192354999916363 Olgimsky's heir spends his days in a pub called The Broken Heart.
6192354999916364 They say Earth wouldn't accept Father. Literally.
6192354999916365 
6192354999916366 They say Earth wouldn't accept Father. Literally…
6192354999916367 Father's body was interred, as per the rite.
6192354999916368 Father's body was given to the sky. I don't care about ancient rites.
6192354999916369 I have accepted Father's duty… whatever it was. But what does it entail?
6192354999916370 I don't know what Father owed, so I can't be responsible for it. What does it mean for me?
6192354999921251 Father's body was given to the sky. There's no need to observe ancient rites.
6192354999921252 I don't know what happened to Father's body. I guess they burned him. I wasn't there.
6192354999921253 Sahba, also called Aspity, preserved Father's inheritance for me.
6192354999921254 
6192354999921255 A steppe woman called Aspity preserved Father's inheritance for me.
6192354999921256 The steppe woman gave me bizarre items. What do they mean?
6192354999921257 I took my inheritance, but I haven't come into it. A right needs to be proven with a deed. \n\nWhich deed will show that I'm truly my father's son?
6192354999921258 
6192354999921259 
6192354999921260 If I want to truly come into Father's legacy, I need to "follow in his footsteps," whatever that means.
6192354999921751 Murky

6192354999923053 Grace is talking to my father this very instant! How is that possible?
6192354999923055 
6192354999923056 
6192354999923057 Talking to the dead is killing Grace. Murky knows another way to meet with a dead man. A less cruel one.
6192354999923058 
6192354999923059 
6192354999923060 Father is dead. I won't waste a girl's life to touch his ghost.
6192354999923061 I talked to my deceased father… \n\nNo. I didn't. I met him, and we talked past each other.
6192354999923062 
6192354999923063 Father is dead. I won't waste a girl's life to have a word with his ghost.
6192354999923064 To talk to the dead Murky's way, one must first collect a bunch of herbs: three blades of twyre (blood, black, and brown), and one blade of swevery.
6192354999923065 
6192354999923066 
6192354999923067 I got the herbs.

6192354999936871 Revolver Ammo
6192354999936872 Not too fresh, but still able to satisfy a little hunger and thirst.
6192354999936874 Black powder. A lead flat-nosed bullet. It's heavy, weighing more than 17 grams. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't always have its billet.
6192354999936877 Common rifle ammo.
6192354999936878 The local children call this pointed ammo "beakers." They often carry a couple in their pockets.
6192354999936879 Shotgun Ammo
6192354999936880 Common shotgun ammo.
6192354999936881 Perfect for putting on railroad tracks. Stakh, Gravel, Grief, and I would do it all the time as kids. Trains were more common back then.
6192354999936882 Averts bad fortune. Unhelpful to me, but some people value it.
6192354999936883 You can't bring about good fortune—but you can craft it, like this handwoven charm. I suppose I could trade it for something.
6192354999936884 Apple
6192354999936885 Each seed might one day become a tree, its roots permeating Earth.
6192354999936886 Peanuts
6192354999936887 Can be munched down—with little effect. The kids here would sell their souls for a handful.
6192354999936888 The game goes like this: find a nut that has traveled far, guess its name, shake it, and listen to stories from the soul trapped inside.\n\nThis originated with the Polyhedron. We didn't play it as kids.
6192354999936889 Gas Mask
6192354999936890 Protects the respiratory tract from lethal gas. In comparison, disease clouds are nothing.
6192354999936891 Very useful, until you consider the reasons why the Army had to mass-produce them.
6192354999936892 Army Gloves
6192354999936893 Protects against infection during contact, like when opening drawers. Of exceptional quality.
6192354999936894 One can't help but wonder how many triggers these gloves have pulled.
6192354999936895 Bandage
6192354999936896 Improves health. Stop bleeding, and you stop death—or delay it, at least. 
6192354999936897 Folks here believe that any affliction can be smothered in bandages, and any decently soft cloth can serve as one. Makes one wonder how people with such advanced medical knowledge even get sick at all.
6192354999936898 Bull Bell
6192354999936899 Did it bring luck to the one who wore it?
6192354999936900 This bell's inner surface is marked with sigils from the secret, sacred steppe alphabet. Like a human body, its insides mirror the universe.
6192354999937651 Blood
6192354999937652 A blood-filled flask.
6192354999937653 Blood is one of the primal elements. It bears life and death. Blood is compulsory.
6192354999937654 Bloody Bandage
6192354999937655 This is a dead item. Someone created it by using a bandage.
6192354999937656 According to sanitary procedures, any object that bears the trace of a deceased person's blood must be burned. According to local belief, it's pointless since the blood will simply appear elsewhere.
6192354999937657 Boots
6192354999937658 Secondhand boots, covered in reddish-black stains. Offer decent protection against contaminated air.
6192354999937659 Too low to traverse marshland, but they won't let you down otherwise. You can kick in doors and walk through trash without fear of blisters.
6192354999937660 Bracelet
6192354999937661 Worn to cut off the flow of warmth between the heart and the ring finger. Too small for me.
6192354999937662 A human body is the sum of its circulation. But it often needs to be interrupted for certain medical procedures.
6192354999937666 Brain
6192354999937667 A section of brain tissue.
6192354999937668 "Blood is only a stream of red and white cells. Sure, they contain information, but how can anything compare to the magnificence of the brain?" Dankovsky once demanded.\nYet a brain is only dull meat.
6192354999937669 Bread
6192354999937670 Bread is the heart of life. It's very filling.
6192354999937671 Never throw bread on the ground. If you're full, give it to a friend. No friends? Give it to an enemy. Hell, give it to a dog. Just don't waste it.
6192354999937851 At last! A crowd now gathers 'round my act! Sit down like that—now watch: Death by Starvation!
6192354999937852 Too busy… but speaking of starvation, have you got any food at all? I'd cut a man open for some dry old toast...
6192354999937853 This thirst keeps driving down toward my death.
6192354999937854 Don't be foolish. <i>I'm</i> the one dying of thirst.
6192354999937855 …I find myself exhausted. Soon to fall! "Dead tired," they say. I wonder what it means?
6192354999937856 I'm no good at riddles.
6192354999937857 …Drink some water, then?
6192354999937858 Indeed; see me act out your fate, dear fool. "Help! Someone help! This thirst is soon to kill me."
6192354999937859 Keep it up. I wanna know how it ends.
6192354999937860 You die, my friend; that's how it ends. Water is all around. Though puddles make poor drinks: Sip then from fountain spouts, from barrel bungs.\nA bottle is all that you need. Here, have one.
6192354999937861 Thanks for the bottle, foolish man.
6192354999937862 I have no water, sir! You see then how I suffer, knowing no solution.
6192354999937863 Same here…
6192354999937864 This is just bad acting. I'm not emotional like that.
6192354999937865 No? 'tis hard to tell, with you. But if you think yourself so smart, do say: what happens next?
6192354999937866 I don't know.
6192354999937867 Someone—not I!—gets a good kick.
6192354999937868 I'll manage without your ridiculous advice, somehow.
6192354999937869 So the good sir fancies a slice? Have one! Shan't last; in half hour's time, my act resumes. Come see: Death by Starvation, lads and lasses!
6192354999937870 That's okay. I'll just find another freak with toast.
6192354999937871 Wrong! You should look for freaks that trade in trash. Perhaps home-owning freaks too foolish to see as you rummage through their paltry things.
6192354999937872 I respect other people's property.
6192354999937873 …That's not a bad idea, actually. I think your "act" may be delayed after all.
6192354999937874 That so? Then our good audience shall their eyes soon feast upon our play: Death by Starvation! Burakh, can you now feel their hungry stares?
6192354999937875 …I think I'll just go. Thanks for the toast, weirdo.
6192354999937876 Fair enough… Can I get a lockpick, then?
6192354999937877 Tough luck. Fortunately, unlike you, I'm nowhere near starving.
6192354999937878 It means you need some sleep.
6192354999937879 When your exhaustion peaks, soon death follows. But how can one escape such a sad fate?
6192354999937880 By getting some sleep.
6192354999937881 Surprise me.
6192354999937882 But woe is me, for I've no place to sleep! Doors lock before this low Tragedian, now unwelcome here in his hometown.
6192354999937883 Same here.
6192354999937884 Is there no bunkhouse for the needy homeless in the Town?
6192354999937885 Go home, Burakh! Repose will do you good. But should you find another's cot: be quick to steal sleep. Sweet dreams, misfortune-seeker.
6192354999937886 …Thanks. And you, too.
6192354999937887 Who knows? But you, Burakh, are no mere tramp. A hero such as you won't be let in.
6192354999937888 I'll sleep when I'm dead, I guess.
6192354999937889 A lockpick might let me in, if I could get one…
6192354999937890 That, I do have for you. Here; have one. Still…
6192354999937891 What?
6192354999937892 You're right… I need to get home. Quickly.
6192354999937893 Be quiet! He must not hear your voice, lean close… He only speaks in lies, and wants you dead!
6192354999937894 I'll be damned. Does everyone want me dead?
6192354999937897 I… see. Care to elaborate on that, monkey-man?
6192354999937898 Do not go home, Burakh. Stay clear of home. In town, you have some friends yet, do you not?
6192354999937899 Let me guess… Father is unhappy with me, isn't he?
6192354999937900 Yes. Three of them. We were inseparable when we were kids.
6192354999937901 Unhappy? Far from it, far as can be. But still: Do not go home, I beg of you. Heed my words true, avert your doom, Burakh.
6192354999937902 Averting doom isn't my style.
6192354999937903 I am home, little man. And here I will stay.
6192354999938078 The Town is yours, Burakh. May you soon find how deep, how far its roots run down your spine. May you inhabit it; sink through its pores. Learn vein and artery, nerve and blood and cell.\nYou need no home beyond the Town itself. Forget that place you so eagerly seek. I beg forgiveness; grievous harm will come to me, should I tell you more than I can.
6192354999938079 Shut your eyes and hide under the covers, then. So no one can hurt you.
6192354999938080 I'll keep what you said in mind.
6192354999938351 Broken Ampoule
6192354999938352 This is a dead item. The carcass of an ampoule of morphine.
6192354999938353 Items used to improve health die. Who could possibly want this?
6192354999938354 Broken Scissors
6192354999938355 The Moerae must have been in a hurry.
6192354999938356 It's said that Clara the Changeling, a thief girl who claims to be a saint, can repair any sharp object just as easily as she cures the sand pest, simply by laying her hands on it.
6192354999938357 Beetle
6192354999938358 A surprising find in autumn, if not useless.
6192354999938359 Where do they go in winter?
6192354999938360 Canned Food
6192354999938361 Filling, although I'm not sure what kind of food is inside.
6192354999938362 Before I returned to the Town, I grabbed a whole sack of canned food. Survived on it for almost a week. I can hardly stand the smell now.
6192354999938363 Candle Stub
6192354999938364 The stub of a nuptial candle. It smells of Earth.
6192354999938365 They say when Wild Nina Kaina, the Dark Mistress of our town, so much as glanced at candles, they'd bow to her—even without wind. 
6192354999938366 A piece of chalk. Used to draw lines.
6192354999938367 Chalk
6192354999938368 The world is one whole, having form only where it is divided. Some Lines are natural; others, man-made. Chalk, composed of the dead bodies of sea creatures, is a good tool for setting boundaries.
6192354999938369 Chestnut
6192354999938370 There are no chestnut trees around, yet chestnuts are pervasive. Truly a town of mysteries.
6192354999938371 The game goes like this: find a nut that has traveled far, guess its name, shake it, and listen to stories from the soul trapped inside.\n\nThis originated with the Polyhedron. We didn't play it as kids.
6192354999939951 Black Twyre
6192354999939952 Blood Twyre
6192354999939953 Brown Twyre
6192354999939954 Coffee
6192354999939955 Coffee beans will immediately energize you, but it's very unhealthy.
6192354999939956 You can forego sleep with coffee—for a week or more, if need be, but it's a bad idea. Whoever refuses dreams dares fate to pass them over.
6192354999939957 It doesn't need people who can't think for themselves, either. "Grab him," they command, and you bite down right away. Let me go, old man. Be a good boy.
6192354999939958 You're the dog here, not me. Put this on.
6192354999939960 Invaluable if one needs to fix a gun or a relatively complex contraption.
6192354999939961 Big Vlad's factories are some of the only stable workplaces in the Town. Unfortunately, he keenly remembers that 'stable' has several meanings.
6192354999939962 Money
6192354999939963 Used to buy items in shops. Offering it during common street barter, however, would be seen as offensive.
6192354999939964 Coins from other times and countries can be found in the Town. Incredibly, shops and traders accept them all.
6192354999939965 Toast
6192354999939966 Soldier food. It's better to eat fresh bread.
6192354999939967 Stale bread is bad news. It doesn't breathe.
6192354999939968 Shoes
6192354999939969 Worn and unimpressive.
6192354999939970 It's forbidden for Herb Brides to have footwear: it's believed they speak with Earth through their rhythmic footsteps. Winter must get cold…
6192354999939971 Egg
6192354999939972 Nothing like a good egg. Delicious. The chicken has yet to be seen.
6192354999939973 People mostly eat unfertilized eggs. This is an empty illusion of possible life.
6192354999939974 Empty Bottle
6192354999939975 Can be filled with water or blood.
6192354999939976 No one drinks water from the Gorkhon river in our town, which is quite sensible. No one digs wells either, which is less so. \n\nClear drinkable water is valued. People can often tell which spring it is from by the taste.
6192354999939978 Executor Cloak
6192354999939979 Protects against infection during contact. The pendants serve no obvious purpose, but tearing them off would be a waste of time.
6192354999939980 Orderlies—the volunteer medical assistants—use these costumes borrowed from the local theatre as protective cloaks. This is the traditional costume of the Reaper, an allegory of Death.
6192354999939981 Cothurni
6192354999939982 Protective footwear. Helps one rise above their troubles—and the poisoned earth.
6192354999939983 This is theatrical footwear, worn by actors. It's likely the orderlies owe their awe-inspiring height to them.
6192354999939984 Muu Shubuun Mask
6192354999939985 Healing herbs placed inside the beak overwhelm all other smells. Protects against disease clouds.
6192354999939986 The mask of Muu Shubuun, "the wicked bird." Part of the Reaper costume from the local theatre. It doesn't have eyeholes: the mask is mounted above an actor's head, who peeks through a hole in the cloak.
6192354999939987 Fishing Hooks
6192354999939988 Sharp objects are regarded as dangerous and thus frowned on by the locals.
6192354999939989 Clara the deranged says that everyone has a hook to grab. But she's a manipulator. What everyone actually has is a knot to untie.
6192354999939990 Blood
6192354999939991 A blood-filled flask.
6192354999939992 Blood is one of the primal elements. It bears life and death. Blood is compulsory.
6192354999939993 Empty Flask
6192354999939994 An empty flask made of thick glass.
6192354999939995 Flasks are rarely used to store water. They're better suited for thicker liquids, like mercury, oil, or blood. 
6192354999939996 Forceps
6192354999939997 A medical tool for operating on soft tissue—for example, in the chest.
6192354999939998 Progress is unstoppable. Even in this remote place, operating with dedicated tools is better.
6192354999940151 …Fine, you've convinced me.
6192354999940153 Go home, all of you. Don't crowd around.
6192354999940154 And yet, I've returned.
6192354999940155 I see. So the house is off limits…
6192354999940164 Guts and shit. The usual.
6192354999940165 Shame. Guts are your area of expertise, not mine. Got enough shit on my hands as it is.
6192354999940166 Why do you ask? Just curiosity?
6192354999940167 What happened?
6192354999940168 Our Halves got poisoned. The doggies. Alma, Duke, and Wolfling.
6192354999940169 Who did it?
6192354999940170 Oh… That's a shame.
6192354999947551 Fish
6192354999947552 Fresh fish. Filling, but it makes your throat feel dry.
6192354999947553 The lateral line is called that for a reason: every fish sees its Line unfold in a stream of possibilities. Sometimes, that Line is a fishing line.
6192354999947554 Leather Gloves
6192354999947555 Protective handwear. Perfect for opening unsafe drawers and doors.
6192354999947556 The Factory recently began training tawers. When flesh fails, the owner of the Bull Enterprise, Fat Vlad, squeezes profit out of hide, too.
6192354999947557 Grindstone
6192354999947558 Used to sharpen knives, scissors... and scalpels.
6192354999947559 Sharp objects are frowned upon, for they are capable of disrupting the sacred wholeness of the body. But you can't cut bread with tradition, so people end up breaking the rule.
6192354999947560 Brain
6192354999947561 A section of brain tissue.
6192354999947562 Among medical conditions, the gravest and most dangerous are those that destroy consciousness, thought, and perception. The key to defeating any unknown disease is in the head.
6192354999947563 Infected Heart
6192354999947564 Ulcerous, yet still almost alive.
6192354999947565 "Every object has a heartbeat. Can't you hear it?"
6192354999947566 Heart
6192354999947567 A hot, almost-beating heart.
6192354999947568 In steppe lore, the center of mind and knowledge is the liver, while the center of feeling and emotion is the lower guts. They view the heart as a less crucial and rather mechanical organ that simply pumps life around, oddly arriving at a consensus with science-based medicine.
6192354999947569 Smoked Fish
6192354999947570 Salty. Spicy. Smells delicious, never spoils, and causes ravaging thirst.
6192354999947571 Once, we tried to tease Lara by calling her "Proud Trout." Instead of becoming offended, she said she respects fish for their calm and focus.
6192354999947572 Immunity Boosters
6192354999947573 Assorted pills of unknown origin. Boost immunity. Smell suspicious.
6192354999947574 Scientifically speaking, there's no consensus on if immunity can be boosted at all. However, these pills work well. According to the box, they were manufactured more than fifty years ago.
6192354999947575 Chisel
6192354999947576 Used to mark and sharpen tools. Handy when fixing bladed weapons and simple machinery.
6192354999947577 Rumor has it, Georgy Kain carved the statue in the Crucible's yard with his own hands. Drivel. Why would a Judge waste his time on that?
6192354999947578 Key
6192354999947579 It's cold.
6192354999947580 It reflects light at odd angles, making its true size difficult to discern.
6192354999947581 Kidney
6192354999947582 A human kidney.
6192354999947583 The body is a perfect representation of the universe. However, the steppe people are not so naive as to correlate organs and bones to cosmic or geographical features. First and foremost, they refer to connections and circulation.
6192354999947584 Kidney
6192354999947585 A human kidney.
6192354999947586 The body is a perfect representation of the universe. However, the steppe people are not so naive as to correlate organs and bones to cosmic or geographical features. First and foremost, they refer to connections and circulation.
6192354999947587 Leash
6192354999947588 Made of sturdy leather. Whoever gets leashed won't get away. Kids value it.
6192354999947589 All Soul-and-a-Halves have a leash. I think they represent humility towards their animal Halves. But what would a Doghead do with one?
6192354999947590 Lemon
6192354999947591 Eating a lot of lemons is bad for your teeth. They won't make you less hungry, but they're certainly an invigorating fruit.
6192354999947592 When life gives you lemons…
6192354999947593 Kashk
6192354999947594 A dry, fermented dairy product. Salty.
6192354999947595 While herding cows and bulls in the steppe, odonghs often live on water and kashk for months at a time. Nothing fancy, but it's nourishing.
6192354999947596 Liver
6192354999947597 A human liver.
6192354999947598 A body is not to be cut open. It's only allowed for menkhu—wise men who know where a body <i>wants</i> to give—and butchers, who accept sin. The word for butcher, "yargachin," also means "surgeon."
6192354999947599 Marbles
6192354999947600 Children give them names. They believe you can find a lost marble by calling after it.
6192354999947601 No one knows how marbles appear in the Town. No one makes or delivers them. They simply pop up here and there; on the floor, under the pillow, or right on the ground.
6192354999947602 Gauze Mask
6192354999947603 Protects against disease clouds. Made from sterile gauze.
6192354999947604 At school, we threw these masks out after one use, since they absorb infection. In the Town, masks are fixed up, boiled, and reused.
6192354999947605 Match
6192354999947606 Can't light an oil lamp without one.
6192354999947607 One must recall that which is most dear to them <i>before</i> the match burns out, or the whole thing won't work.
6192354999947608 Fresh Meat
6192354999947609 Every path in the world leads to meat. Nothing is more filling.
6192354999947610 The human world is a world of meat. The spirit is nothing more than twitching, trembling meat. Whoever denies meat will become extinct.
6192354999947611 Not as good as fresh meat, but better preserved. Tear it apart with your teeth; no forks or knives required.
6192354999947612 Smoked Meat
6192354999947613 Canned meat. Jerked meat. Smoked meat. Boiled meat. Beef, ham. The art of cooking meat is truly honored in the Town.
6192354999947614 Milk
6192354999947615 Warm, creamy. Satisfies hunger and thirst. Reminds me of childhood.
6192354999947616 Often used an an offering to the dead, milk serves as a reminder that all that is born must come to an end. It is said that the dead drink milk over water because the flow of water reminds them of the flow of time.
6192354999947617 Needle
6192354999947618 As piercing as a wise person's stare. Can be used to pick small locks, such as the ones in cabinet drawers.
6192354999947619 They say that when Lara Ravel pricked her finger with a needle, no blood was drawn, and she hasn't ever fallen asleep ever since.
6192354999947620 Ashen Swish
6192354999947621 Note
6192354999947622 Unfold to read the text.
6192354999947623 "I've found a spare key, but these key thefts (?) are becoming concerning. Your equipment is far from cheap, is it not? It would serve no one if it gets stolen.\n\nAnd do keep in mind that if our small arrangement is uncovered, I too will have to bear the consequences.\n\n-V. O."
6192354999947624 Package
6192354999947625 Contains unknown useful items. Unfold to extract them.
6192354999947626 Barter has a long history in our community. It has many styles, such as "tit for tat." Sometimes, people even blindly swap wrapped items.
6192354999947627 Different from my other medications. I need to test it on an infected person to see if it can cure the plague.
6192354999947628 Serum
6192354999947629 The liquid is thick and smells of soil. I brewed it from hot underground blood and a tincture.\n\n…Is this it?
6192354999947630 Pemmican
6192354999947631 A mixture of meat, fruit, and fat. Extremely filling, only slightly revolting.
6192354999947632 Pemmican isn't eaten for pleasure. This form preserves meat and fat, so that's how odonghs prepare it before venturing into the steppe for weeks to herd bulls.
6192354999947633 Pocket Watch
6192354999947634 Recently stopped. That means that the owner most likely died.
6192354999947635 Victor Kain never carries a watch around, but always knows the correct time, down to the second. We've tested him. Can he tell by the stars?
6192354999947636 "Shmowder"
6192354999947637 A box filled with a yellowish powder. Guess it's for some kind of game.
6192354999947638 Smells like medicine. A dangerous idea for a game. Destroying this would be the responsible thing to do.
6192354999947639 Raisins
6192354999947640 Once a juicy grape, now a small sweet that wouldn't satisfy an infant.
6192354999947641 If a train is late, first we run out of cookies, then chocolate, then candy. Only after that do children remember raisins.
6192354999947642 Revolver
6192354999947643 A six-chambered, military-grade revolver. Imprecise. Limited range.
6192354999947644 The civil war has gone on for more than two years. The hostility mostly passed our hellhole by, but refugees and deserters keep spreading military equipment to the furthest parts of the country.
6192354999947645 Ring
6192354999947646 It circles back, like time. Equally precious.
6192354999947647 "Ding-a-ding,\nHear the ring ring…"
6192354999947648 Safety Pin
6192354999947649 Both safe and unsafe at the same time.
6192354999947650 Murky the orphan says that safety pins are like people: open or closed, they always have a pointy end.
6192354999948851 Okay, I'm gonna explain how this works, and you're gonna listen.\nAll suspects get locked up while investigation is ongoing. That'll happen in the morning. You can scream, shout, run around in circles, bang on doors all you want—morning is when you get out, and not a moment sooner. You've got food and water. Now wait.
6192354999948852 I need to talk to the governor.
6192354999948853 If you need to, you will. In the morning.
6192354999948854 Listen, pal. Do you know who I am?
6192354999948855 I need to go to the toilet.
6192354999948856 I know you're lying. You don't need the bathroom. I can tell from your eyes. I'm a great judge of character.
6192354999948857 I really do.
6192354999948858 Look, you're obviously not an uncharitable man. Maybe you'd like a bit more in your pocket?
6192354999948861 Who wouldn't? But we can't take bribes. And you don't have anywhere near enough to make someone ignore their orders.
6192354999948862 How much would it take?
6192354999948863 I don't feel good… I think I'm having a stroke. I need a doctor…
6192354999948864 You can tie my hands if you don't trust me.
6192354999948865 Do you even get to sleep tonight?
6192354999948866 Do you think I'm stupid? I know what you're up to. It's called weaseling. You figure there must be a way out and you're trying to wind me up, find the right approach. Right?
6192354999948867 I'm not that kind of person.
6192354999948868 …Yeah. Want to give me a hint?
6192354999948869 Look. You aren't coming out of that cell a moment before the order's given. Period. Except under a shroud, maybe. The walls and door won't break down, so don't even try it. \nYou've got a cot; use it. You'll want to be refreshed tomorrow for the investigation.
6192354999948870 So what, Saburov's going to torture me?
6192354999948871 I don't have time to sleep, pal. I'm needed outside!
6192354999948872 My father is dead. And here you are…
6192354999948875 Turns out you're innocent. They got the culprit. Everyone else is free to go.
6192354999948876 They got the culprit? Who is it?
6192354999948877 Finally.
6192354999948878 They got the culprit? Where are they?
6192354999948879 You think anyone tells me that kind of thing? If someone's free to go, they aren't a suspect anymore. Right? So the culprit must have been caught. It's called logic.\nAlthough… maybe they weren't. Not my place to know. My orders were to let the big one go. The Master vouched for you.
6192354999948880 What Master?
6192354999948881 Fat Vlad. Vlad Olgimsky, that is. The big one. Vlad Senior. 
6192354999948882 All four of them? That's a rousing vote of confidence.
6192354999948883 I have no master.
6192354999948884 Okay. So long, pal.
6192354999948896 If you see a man, run. Men are angry today. They kill the likes of you and I.
6192354999948897 You think we have anything in common, odongh?
6192354999948898 Why are they so hateful?
6192354999948899 We're not human. We're different.
6192354999948900 You're a worm, true. But I am human all right.
6192354999948901 Unfortunately, I am made of flesh and blood. So I'll take your advice.
6192354999948902 Looking for a murderer. Turning into murderers themselves. This is how a town changes.
6192354999948903 What murderer? What does it have to do with me?
6192354999948904 I'll be cautious.
6192354999948905 You look like a murderer. Do not delve into the town's flesh in you want to live. Keep to the outskirts. Less people here.
6192354999948906 Thanks, Worm. Let Mother Boddho keep your footprints warm.
6192354999948907 I can't. I have business at the heart of the town.
6192354999948908 Oh my brothers, my brothers in spirits! Behold a man, head higher than the sky! Behold a creature of well-earned pride. Dare I trouble you, good sir, with trivial talk?
6192354999948909 Well?
6192354999948910 Great, a poet. Go ahead, I'm listening.
6192354999948911 God, no. Someone's on my tail.
6192354999948912 Oh, how ferocious Mother Nature is! For 'tis her wrath that must be borne. Oh friend, if only I could quench my thirst… I'd give heaven and earth for a sip of cold water!
6192354999948913 Drink from the river, then.
6192354999948914 Only brute beasts drink from the river. Us proud men deserve spring water. It is brought here in barrels, but they're too often empty. I would get it there, but I have no bottles. I'd drink from a fountain, but I might faint first… The air is far too heady.
6192354999948915 The air <i>is</i> heady here in September.
6192354999948916 You're literally next to a pub.
6192354999948917 The pub is closed, good sir, but even if it wasn't… What makes it open, really? One must ask oneself… And anyway, Stamatin the Curmudgeonly has introduced new rules, with another sort of liquid flowing. A fiery one. A good one, but not one I need at the moment… \nSo, do you have water?
6192354999948918 I don't. But the river is right there. You'll make it. I believe in you.
6192354999948919 Maybe I do.
6192354999948920 Yeah right. I didn't come halfway across the country to get you a drink from a barrel.
6192354999948921 You do actually seem about to faint. A stroke seems closer than the river.
6192354999948922 You're in luck. Have some of mine.
6192354999948923 Yeah… Tough to find good water around here.
6192354999948924 …H-how? Why? Curse this air, this mind-numbing odor… What do we do now?
6192354999948925 Did you do this?
6192354999948926 Nothing. There's nothing more to be done.
6192354999948927 Why did you do that to her?
6192354999948928 In the morning, people screamed about a steppe abomination, that it left no footprints and had bones for legs. \nBut now look: It's only a girl. A steppe girl, sure, but… alive.
6192354999948935 You're a brave soul… as befits Isidor's son, of course. It takes courage to claim your name today.
6192354999948936 I would never renounce my father. I have nothing to be ashamed of.
6192354999948937 Whatcha lookin' at? Get lost. We got him first.
6192354999948938 Who is he?
6192354999948939 Don'tcha see? Burakh the Turncoat! Isidor's son himself!
6192354999948940 …And what has he done?
6192354999948941 Just wait until someone gets you, too.
6192354999948942 Have you lost your mind? He has nothing to do with this.
6192354999948943 Take a good look at me. <i>I</i> am Isidor's son.
6192354999948944 The bastard put his own dad six feet under! So whatcha lookin' at? Get lost, or you're next!
6192354999948945 Pull it together, will you? Breathe. You're gonna pull a muscle—wouldn't be able to deliver justice, then…
6192354999948946 Oh yes he does! The whole Town's saying he did it.
6192354999948947 Done what? You idiots…
6192354999948948 …Right. Well, be careful not to take all this too far.
6192354999948949 I am Artemy Burakh, not this man. And I didn't kill my father.
6192354999948950 Any cracked ribs? Bones? Breathe in, out.
6192354999950051 Scalpel
6192354999950052 Either a weapon that can take someone's life, or an essential tool for a surgeon.
6192354999950053 A tool for a surgeon. A tool for a menkhu. A tool for a bandit. A tool for a ripper. A tool for me.
6192354999950054 Lockpick
6192354999950055 I can either cut someone with it, or use it to pick a door lock. Either way it will break after a couple of uses.
6192354999950056 It is taboo to cut flesh in the Town, but crafty people know how to bend the rules. These <i>lockpicks</i> can produce unbearably painful wounds. Perhaps breaking and entering is more ethical.
6192354999950057 Soap
6192354999950058 A bar of common soap.
6192354999950059 Nothing fancy, but soap is the best way to maintain hygiene. Essential.
6192354999950060 Spindle
6192354999950061 It's almost out of thread.
6192354999950062 Victoria Olgimskaya used to spin. Only for show, of course. What's there to spin when your husband slaughters bulls instead of herding sheep?
6192354999950063 Swevery
6192354999950064 Tourniquet
6192354999950065 Used to improve health. The townsfolk prefer locally made leather tourniquets over rubber ones.
6192354999950066 Alexander Saburov hoped to outlaw tourniquets in a desperate attempt to protect his Katerina from morphine addiction. What a silly idea. One can't just outlaw bands made out of rubber and leather.
6192354999950067 Walnuts
6192354999950068 Can be munched down—with little effect. The kids here would sell their souls for a handful.
6192354999950069 The game goes like this: find a nut that has traveled far, guess its name, shake it, and listen to stories from the soul trapped inside.\n\nThis originated with the Polyhedron. We didn't play it as kids.
6192354999950070 Water Bottle
6192354999950071 Quenches thirst. Serves as a base for tinctures. Water from the Gorkhon river is undrinkable.
6192354999950072 Fresh water is carried into the Town daily from steppe springs, then distributed by water bearers. The Gorkhon water has long been poisoned by the Factory pollution. It's dangerous to even touch.
6192354999950073 Spring
6192354999950074 A rusty metal spring. Useful to fix all kinds of tools.
6192354999950075 Industrialization granted the local workers new rights and fixed working hours. All it asked in return was their free will.
6192354999950076 Thimble
6192354999950077 Useless in a town that forbids sharp objects. Still good for sewing.
6192354999950078 Young ladies of good upbringing are often taught embroidery. But young Capella never uses a thimble. A Mistress must sense a needle's path; if she doesn't, she deserves the consequences.
6192354999952051 Thread
6192354999952052 Ties that which is torn; fates, if it's red.
6192354999952053 Serious surgery requires thread, but in the field there's often no time to sew together wounds. Bandages and tourniquets have to do.
6192354999952054 Trepanner
6192354999952055 Use to crack the skull for an operation or autopsy.
6192354999952056 This crude tool is frowned upon by some judgmental types. But they don't have to deal with the real epidemics, do they?
6192354999952057 Tweezers
6192354999952058 Useful to repair delicate equipment.
6192354999952059 Some kids sort their stamp collections with these; others tear wings off bugs.
6192354999952060 White Whip
6192354999952061 Plaguefinder
6192354999952062 A mysterious device that allows me to better see signs of sand pest.
6192354999952063 Disregard the how; <i>why</i> was this made at all? And by whom?
6192354999952151 And tomorrow, it'll be different somehow?
6192354999952152 Who knows. If we attack each other today, might as well grow wings tomorrow.
6192354999952153 Let me examine you. I'm a doctor.
6192354999952154 Didn't look like <i>you</i> attacked anyone.
6192354999952155 You're a true hero. Not because you defended me, but because you don't fear the truth. You can be trusted. 
6192354999952156 I don't like how pale you are. Let me dress your wound.
6192354999952157 Still, I'd like to dress your wound... if I had a bandage.
6192354999952160 I'm all right. They only hit me once or twice…
6192354999952161 Yeah. You'll live.
6192354999952162 Saved their strength for me.
6192354999952451 Seems the Burakh prophecy is true, huh? Each Burakh will spill a river of blood. Or drown the Town in blood, maybe—the wording varies. So it goes. So much death…
6192354999952452 Burakh? You mean Isidor?
6192354999952453 Have you seen much death?
6192354999952454 Of course. He may not have spilled it himself, but it's all happening because of him. Just as the prophecy foretold.
6192354999952455 Bullshit. Old wives' tales.
6192354999952456 Yes. We've never suffered this before—no, certainly not like this. Mark my words: the end is nigh. The Wormwood star rises in the night sky.
6192354999952457 Perhaps it is the end.
6192354999952458 Isidor has nothing to do with this. This is on you.
6192354999952459 None of this is my fault.
6192354999952460 A shabnak-adyg always steals the form of a woman, but that's mere illusion, broken the moment it starts to run. That's when you notice the legs, made of bone or clay. It leaves no trace behind. When it runs, the illusion dissolves, like a smell carried away on the wind.
6192354999952461 A shabnak-adyg is a myth! It's not real.
6192354999952462 You're chasing steppe demons, huh? A little seasonal lapse of sanity?
6192354999952463 Here's my method: If it doesn't have any brains, that means its head is made of clay. Take it right to the cemetery.
6192354999952466 You must be an outsider. If you'd lived here as long as I have, you'd sing a different tune. \nHere, the Earth is alive. It bears more than just crops. Sometimes, it spits out a horror so unfathomable, you spend the whole night sleeping in fits and starts. Clay and bones cultivate a beast. People don't kill other people around here—only a shabnak would do that.
6192354999952467 I'm a local.
6192354999952468 Right. The cemetery's where they come from. Lots of clay there, and bones.
6192354999952469 I was making fun of you, idiot.
6192354999952470 Then off to the cemetery you go! Say hello to the ghosts for me.
6192354999952472 So… Are they all finished over by the Stake? Trial complete?
6192354999952473 What stake?
6192354999952474 Everyone's losing their minds. Hell, they'll start looking for ghosts and bogeymen soon. Shabnaks don't exist. It's just the damned twyre blooming, making our heads swim.
6192354999952475 Agreed.
6192354999952476 Do you know who started the rumor?
6192354999952477 Anything is possible. I've met people who only looked human on the outside—deep down, they were vile beasts.
6192354999952478 Who could ever figure that out now?\n…You know, I swear I recognize your face. Who are you?
6192354999952479 I'm Artemy, Isidor Burakh's son. I have returned.
6192354999952480 Wrong, sister. You couldn't possibly know who I am.
6192354999952481 What trial?
6192354999952482 Did you hit your head somewhere, big guy? Or are you just stupid? They caught a man-eater at the Bone Stake Lot. A clay demon from the steppe! Look, I don't have time to catch up some random idiot.
6192354999952483 Wait, where's that lot?
6192354999952484 Holy hell. Your parents ever teach you any manners?
6192354999952485 What an idiot! I'd say you're an outsider, but you're dressed like a factory worker. That where you hit your head? The lot's in the Skinners.
6192354999952486 Got it. Maybe I'll take a look…
6192354999952487 Get out of here, kid, before I teach you some manners myself.
6192354999952490 Ah… So you are Burakh's heir?
6192354999952491 I am.
6192354999952492 Why do you ask?
6192354999952493 You're one of Olgimsky's men now, right? Big Vlad said anyone who touches you will be in for a world of hurt.
6192354999952494 What the hell?
6192354999952495 He's a complete stranger to me. And I don't need anyone to intercede on my behalf.
6192354999952498 No. I'm my own man. As is Olgimsky.
6192354999952499 It's unwise to get in his way. Boös is a powerful patron. Don't let him down.
6192354999952500 I'll stay on my toes.
6192354999952502 He wants to decide my fate behind my back? Good luck with that.
6192354999952503 Move along… or I'll scream!
6192354999952504 Why are you all so angry? Have I wronged you in some way?
6192354999952506 I'm going, I'm going… Just calm down.
6192354999952507 You're a cold-blooded murderer. You killed our protector. You're a walking clue, fella: bloody clothes, foreign face, and you stink like a railroad. Rumor has it, that's where the murderer hid.\nWere you trying to escape? Skip town?
6192354999952508 What protector? Who are you talking about?
6192354999952509 I only arrived several hours ago, woman.
6192354999952510 You know who. Move along, I said! I have nothing to talk to you about! And stop glaring, I'm not afraid of you. I'll scream!
6192354999952511 Why don't you, then? Go ahead.
6192354999952512 Shut up! Shut up, or <i>I'll</i> scream.
6192354999952951 You poor thing… We still think you're good.
6192354999952952 You feel sorry for me? You're an angel.
6192354999952953 We who?
6192354999952954 I do.
6192354999952955 Likewise.
6192354999952956 Well… Tata, Rubber, Filya, Tag, Cuckoo, Lelya, Ruffle… Also, Ruta and Tisha. And Capella only said good things about you.
6192354999952957 That's like a whole army. So I'm not alone.
6192354999952958 Tell them… tell them I'm grateful.
6192354999952959 You'll grow up into a good person.
6192354999952960 Tata brought kittens yesterday. Six. Do you want a kitten?
6192354999952961 Right, a kitten. Exactly what I need.
6192354999952962 I'm like a kitten myself. That's enough cats in my life.
6192354999952963 I'll think about it.
6192354999953051 На Пустыре Костного Столба происходит расправа над некой «людоедкой».
6192354999964351 Odongh
6192354999964352 Reflection
6192354999964353 Vigilante
6192354999964354 Kingfisher
6192354999964357 Prison Guard
6192354999964358 Lost One
6192354999965929 Er… Sorry! I didn't mean to.
6192354999965930 Who are you?
6192354999965931 I just… dropped by to warm myself up. I'm from the cannery. Canning stuff.
6192354999965932 What are you doing here?
6192354999965933 What were you playing?
6192354999965934 No idea. I just came to it, raised the lid… and it kinda just… happened.\nSo I'm a musician, huh? Weird.
6192354999965935 You played for the first time ever? That <i>is</i> weird.
6192354999965936 So you play piano.
6192354999965937 You're a savant, then. You should study music seriously. Leave for the Capital.
6192354999965938 Don't come closer. Or I'll scream.
6192354999965939 Who are you?
6192354999965940 I'm nearly screaming already.
6192354999965941 Who taught you this melody?
6192354999965942 How do you know this melody?
6192354999965943 This sweet melody is not your malady. What do you want?
6192354999965944 Nothing, really. I'm leaving.
6192354999965945 Don't piss me off, kid. Just tell me.
6192354999965946 I wrote it myself. Just now. Will you flick off? Eff off? And never come back?\nMother told me not to say "fuck off" to people, not directly.
6192354999965947 Play it one more time, will you?
6192354999965948 You sure are no sister of Capella's.
6192354999966451 Never coming back is a fate in store for all of us.
6192354999966452 You lying little punk. Your grimy fingers couldn't have created this melody.
6192354999972255 I need fifty clear-headed people armed with spades. A tall order, I know.\nSpades and common sense don't mix in your prehistoric dump of a town. Fifty spades I can manage, but gathering a dozen thinking men is impossible. Either that, or they can't dig. Like me.
6192354999972256 Why so many?
6192354999972257 I need to solve the problem of mass graves once and for all.\nOh, and we need to choose which part of the Town to designate as the new graveyard. Because the old one currently refuses to entertain new guests.
6192354999972258 Refuses to entertain new guests? What do you mean?
6192354999972259 Do you know who manages the graveyard? A minor. The cretins Saburov assigned to be my helpers—<i>my helpers,</i> I'd like to emphasize, subordinates—stopped working because something is bothering the girl. \nI'm starting to think that brain atrophy is what's really killing this town.
6192354999972260 I know her. Her name is Grace.
6192354999972261 A man of vision, then. Way to go, emshen.
6192354999972262 What's bothering her?
6192354999972263 I really couldn't care less. What matters is that right now, we lack a place to bury the dead. Thoughts? You are, after all, a local.
6192354999972264 Cremation?
6192354999972265 Spot on, Burakh.\nIf the morning report can be believed, the factory furnaces are spacious enough to solve our little problem. But the locals refuse to burn the dead. And if we generously call their babbling an "argument," it always boils down to referencing that deranged girl.
6192354999972266 Look, I can't make heads or tails of what you want from <i>me.</i>
6192354999972267 I'll see what I can do.
6192354999974351 
6192354999974352 
6192354999974353 A deadly disease is devouring my town. We have no experienced doctors.\n\nWhat shall we do?
6192354999974354 
6192354999974355 
6192354999974356 Sometimes, a melody can be heard in ordinary houses that only Victoria Olgimskaya and her daughter knew.\n\nIf I find the mysterious musician, I can tell Capella about them.
6192354999974357 
6192354999974358 
6192354999974359 A random worker had been playing Victoria's melody, even though he had no music skills. Could it have really been a spirit? Or is there another answer?
6192354999974360 
6192354999974361 
6192354999974362 Some girl had been playing Victoria's melody. Did she overhear it and decide to prank Capella? Or is there another answer?
6192354999974363 
6192354999974364 
6192354999974365 Clara the Changeling had been playing Victoria's melody. There's no more Victoria. What do I tell Capella?
6192354999974366 
6192354999974367 
6192354999974368 Capella will no longer trick herself into the belief that souls are immortal, or at least the soul of her mother.
6192354999974369 Now Capella knows that there's still hope. Perhaps her mother Victoria still lives… in a way.
6192354999976174 What do you mean? Don't you dare! No one can replace me!
6192354999976175 Why, exactly?
6192354999976177 No one else knows how to care for them. No one else knows how to listen. No one else will whisper them kind words!\nEach of them is like kin to me. I feel them listening to my lullabies…
6192354999976178 Fair enough. You're irreplaceable.
6192354999976210 What do you want to hear, human?
6192354999976211 How many dead do you think are down there?
6192354999976212 More than I would like. Any other questions?
6192354999976213 Is it possible to… relocate some of them somewhere else?
6192354999976214 I have a name, you know.
6192354999976215 Two names. Maybe more. Two for certain. I do not care. What do you want?
6192354999976216 I want to move the dead from the graveyard, but there's no place for them.
6192354999976217 Nothing. I don't like you.
6192354999976218 It can be arranged. It would be my pleasure. Should I make it less crowded?
6192354999976223 Do the dead keep living underground? Or did Grace dream that up?
6192354999976224 She didn't.
6192354999976225 How do I stop the screaming?
6192354999976226 The graveyard is crowded.
6192354999976227 Very much so.
6192354999976228 Can anything be done about it?
6192354999976229 Arrange it, then.
6192354999976239 No, wait. I don't like the way you just licked your snout.
6192354999976240 One moment… Another… Oh, so many of them. So many, indeed.\nThat's it. All done.
6192354999976241 What exactly did you do?
6192354999976242 What, is that it?
6192354999976243 I solved your problem. Got what you came for? You did.
6192354999976244 I'm not dropping this. What did you do?
6192354999976245 Whoever laid right of me, better to not think of them. But those to the left, they are fine now. Do you understand me, human? Go, human.
6192354999976246 I didn't understand any of that.
6192354999976247 I'll check.
6192354999976248 I understand.
6192354999976249 …Did you gobble them up, or something?
6192354999976250 It's quieter…
6192354999976651 Well, are you happy now?
6192354999976652 Have they stopped screaming?
6192354999976653 They are scared. I feel like something terrible has happened. But I don't understand… they're silent. They stopped talking to me.
6192354999976654 But they have enough space now. That's what matters.
6192354999976655 Do you know about a creature that lives underground? Looks like a rat?
6192354999976656 There are no creatures underground. Only the earth, and the dead becoming earth. The earth and the dead are the same. Connected through their shared life.
6192354999976657 Thought so.
6192354999976658 It seems I've made a mistake…
6192354999976659 I refuse to burn corpses in the Factory's furnaces. 'Tis not God's way. A hock? Sure. A sausage? Be my guest. Leather to dry? I'm all for it.\nBut a person…
6192354999976660 Not a person. A corpse.
6192354999976663 Mr. Big-City Dandy wants us to burn corpses in the furnaces. He can burn or boil 'em back where he's from, but here, we don't burn our dead. I'm the master of furnaces, and that's what I'm telling you.
6192354999976664 Master of furnaces?
6192354999976665 Sabotage, then?
6192354999976666 Sabotage it is. We're not steppe beasts. We're civilized folk here. We have respect for the dead.\nYou see it our way, don't you? You're with us, with the people?
6192354999976667 So you refuse to burn corpses?
6192354999976668 That's what I'm telling you.
6192354999976669 You will burn the dead. If you won't, you'll die because of it.
6192354999976670 No. I'm always on my own.
6192354999976671 With <i>my</i> people. I'm one of those steppe beasts, in case you wondered.
6192354999976672 Huh. Meaning?
6192354999976673 Meaning you'll burn the dead. End of discussion.
6192354999976674 Like anyone's asking you.
6192354999976676 It's bad to leave the dead lying around. Corpses spread the plague, see? It spreads through the earth too. Flies carry it, for example.
6192354999976677 We have a graveyard. Dumping them into pits. Saw that, didn't you? Means city suit gave the order. Means it's all good.
6192354999976678 …No. I really don't think it's all good.
6192354999976679 Not for us to decide.
6192354999976680 Whatever you say.
6192354999976681 Oh, what have you done… What have you done!
6192354999976682 I do pity your dead. But I tend to the living. They're more important.
6192354999976683 Forgive me.
6192354999976684 No. It's the dead who are important. The living can take care of themselves. The dead can't.
6192354999976685 I'm sorry.
6192354999976686 Don't come here anymore. I don't want to see you… for some time.
6192354999976687 Okay. Whatever you say.
6192354999976688 Maybe I can make it up to you.
6192354999977651 Ugh, the little rat is crying. Will you help me carry it? Just remember it's mine. I found it.
6192354999977652 What are you doing here?
6192354999977656 Hunting.
6192354999977657 What, like rats?
6192354999977658 What did you find?
6192354999977659 Show me your hands, hunter.
6192354999977660 An order came from the Sandbox. Anyone who saves a baby from a plague house gets their sins absolved. Easy, right?\nIf only you saw how many bastards were brought. But I have a witness now! Perfect! Can you help me carry it?
6192354999977661 So, we're baby hunting. And how goes the hunt?
6192354999977662 I don't want to touch it, you see. First of all, it's crying. Second, it stinks. But the crying's enough. I hate noise, I just hate it. Especially this kind of noise.
6192354999977663 I see you're no fan of babies.
6192354999977665 Won't you be a mother someday? Keep practicing.
6192354999977666 What "sandbox"?
6192354999977667 Are you from another planet? The Town Hall.
6192354999977668 Are you considering adoption?
6192354999977669 Are you mad? Look, I adore children, just not so much <i>touching</i> them. I thought I could bear it, but… ugh.\nSo, will you help me carry it or not?
6192354999977670 You're shaking like a vampire around garlic! It won't bite you.
6192354999977671 Fine, I'll carry it. Just stay out of my way. You don't deserve absolution.
6192354999977673 This is <i>utterly</i> unfair! I walked into a plague house! I showed courage! This is what they promised to reward, not <i>touching</i> them!
6192354999977674 I told you: I'll carry the baby. You go home. And don't you ever do this again.
6192354999977675 Fine. You deal with the little beast.
6192354999977739 You've heard that bitch, surely? She's saying the child's no orphan, that it's hers! Oh <i>please,</i> it's ridiculous!
6192354999977740 And what are you doing here, blackbird?
6192354999977741 You're not the type to just give up.
6192354999977742 So you've finally acquired a taste for newborns?
6192354999977743 Why are you mad at me? I'm no shabnak. I'm a poor performer trying to help. And yet you snarl at me the way a bear would a hunter!\nWhat if I have my own history with children, hm? A debt I must pay?
6192354999977744 Yeah, yeah, whatever. You're not taking them to the Town Hall, are you?
6192354999977745 I'm taking them somewhere safe. You think this is better?\nYou're not my confessor! You have blood on your hands, ripper. You shouldn't be around kids!
6192354999977746 I'm no ripper! I'm a physician.
6192354999977747 Okay, stop yelling! Give us a break.
6192354999977748 Where are you taking them? Answer me, you ghoul! To Var? The herbalists? Tell me before I tear off your head!
6192354999977749 To good people! They make drugs out of them in the Sandbox, I think. No one knows what happens to them next, though.
6192354999977750 "Good people," you say?
6192354999982651 This is madness…
6192354999982652 Good, kind people. I've said all I can, and won't tell you anything else.
6192354999982653 You know I'll figure it out anyway.
6192354999982654 Well, I won't try to beat it out of you. What if you start singing?
6192354999982655 Yargachin, calm this witch down. She is up to no good.
6192354999982656 Is it your baby?
6192354999982657 And you, why are you here?
6192354999982658 They signed an order. We are to go door to door and search for the helpless. Especially infants. Whoever brings a baby from a plague house to the Town Hall will be pardoned.
6192354999982659 Are you guilty of something?
6192354999982660 "Yargachin"? Not me, I'm not one of your butchers.
6192354999982661 It is a sign of respect. No one is wiser than a yargachin, one who follows the Lines with his knife.
6192354999982662 Fine. So what's going on here?
6192354999982663 And who are you?
6192354999982664 Why haven't I heard of this?
6192354999982665 My husband killed a woman on the first day of the outbreak. She was no shabnak. Now he awaits execution in the town jail.\nI would redeem him, yargachin. A life for a life.
6192354999982669 It is mine, yargachin. My child.
6192354999982671 It's not true, basaghan. Why are you lying? I can see it.
6192354999982672 Look at her face, she's a steppe woman! Do you know what they do to their babies? They turn them into soap! Everyone knows it!
6192354999982673 Yeah, that's a… well-known fact.
6192354999982674 Exactly, she's a steppe woman, so I trust her more than you. So be quiet and let me talk to her.
6192354999982675 So, what have you decided?
6192354999982676 Take it. I trust <i>you</i> more.
6192354999982678 I think neither of you is entirely honest. I'd rather take the baby to the Town Hall myself.
6192354999982679 Well? Are you convinced now?
6192354999982680 Okay, okay. Take it to these "good people" of yours. Try not to drop it.
6192354999982682 Stop arguing. I'll take the baby to the Town Hall myself.
6192354999982728 You know, I received a little business proposition today. The whole job stinks, but us beggars can't be choosers, eh?
6192354999982729 Tell me more.
6192354999982730 Sure, whatever.
6192354999982731 Don't even think about it. I need you here.
6192354999982732 The job is hiding stiffs. The townsfolk are afraid to surrender their dead.
6192354999982733 How do you even hide a corpse?
6192354999982734 Why?
6192354999982735 First off, the houses people died in get quarantined and boarded up… with people still inside. Damkovsky's orders. \nSecondly, there's no space left at the graveyard, so bodies get burned. The townsfolk are not too keen on that. Grace must be really worried.
6192354999982736 So what?
6192354999982737 Wipe your nose.
6192354999982738 Anyway, people need to hide corpses. Stench becomes an issue quick. It's the smell that gives them away. Can't put them in the icebox, after all.
6192354999982739 Spill it, already! What's the job?
6192354999982740 Yeah, I know about the graveyard problem.
6192354999982741 It's "Dankovsky."
6192354999982742 Damn-kovsky. He thinks he's the only person in the Town who knows which end of a spoon goes into your mouth. \nWhatever he says, people rush to obey it. Even boös bows to him. And the Kains adore him.
6192354999982743 So what?
6192354999982745 Maybe I should wear a bowtie too, while I'm at it?
6192354999982746 Don't get sassy. Tell me more about this corpse thing.
6192354999982747 So, there's a chemist in the Atrium. He whipped up some sort of concoction that prevents decay. Gathered some guys, around fifty, maybe more… Now they go around at night and empalm stiffs.
6192354999982748 And that's the job you were offered?
6192354999982749 Where do they hide them, then…?
6192354999982750 "Embalm."
6192354999983651 Yup. Plenty of guys willing to do anything for quick coin these days. Me included. They hinted they wanted me to recruit you, too. Inconspicuously.
6192354999983652 Inconspicuous is your middle name.
6192354999983653 That's… well, there's more I'd say if you were older, but that's just slow suicide!
6192354999983654 Why? They're empalmed and everything.
6192354999983655 Where is this madness taking place?
6192354999983656 So what are you going to do?
6192354999983657 This sounds like the kind of mess Dankovsky should handle.
6192354999983658 All around town. They work at night, quietly. Nobody'll catch them in the act.
6192354999983659 As if I don't have enough on my plate already.
6192354999983660 I guess you're right…
6192354999983661 I'm going to have a little chat with that chemist of yours. Go ahead and accept the offer, because I'm gonna need a witness after this.
6192354999983662 Leaving corpses indoors is out of the question. I've got to put an end to this.
6192354999983663 Oh, I'd love to see that, believe me.
6192354999987051 
6192354999987052 
6192354999987053 
6192354999987054 
6192354999987055

6192354999987058 
6192354999987059

6192354999987068 
6192354999987069 
6192354999987251 Something's wrong with this shop.
6192354999987252 This shop has been turned into a shrine.
6192354999989551 I know not, yargachin. Why would you? You're a respected man, your father's son. You're guiltless. Why bother you?\nYou have your own affairs to manage. They say you are looking for a cure. They say, "He's up all night, he's getting close."
6192354999989552 That is true.
6192354999989553 That's not true.
6192354999989554 It is good that you don't give up hope.
6192354999989555 You are a brave woman, basaghan.
6192354999989556 The likes of you and me are few and far between. This work is dangerous. This disease is dangerous. People like this woman are dangerous. She should be killed, yargachin.
6192354999989557 It's up to me what I to do.
6192354999989559 She's just like you.
6192354999989560 This is foolish. He'll be released, but you'll get sick and die. How does that help anyone?
6192354999989610 You! You brought new bodies, didn't you? Please, enough. Stop bringing them here. There's so many of them, I can barely hear…
6192354999989611 Grace, this is a graveyard. This is where the dead belong.
6192354999989612 The earth is cramped. No more space. They trample each other, they wail!
6192354999989613 They don't care anymore, kid.
6192354999989614 No! They care! They feel! And there's no peace for them now.\nThat's all they need: consolation and peace. There is no one more miserable, more helpless than the dead—can't you see that?
6192354999989615 You're imagining things, Grace.
6192354999989618 Imagine fifty people crammed into this room. You can't bend your knees, can't turn, can't scratch your back, can't even shrug. And it lasts for <i>days.</i> How would you feel? It's torture!
6192354999989619 They feel nothing, kid. They're dead.
6192354999989620 No, doctor! You don't believe me, do you? Go and listen! Go listen to those huge graves—they dump people there by the dozen!
6192354999989621 There, there… Don't cry.
6192354999989622 Perhaps, but the living are more important.
6192354999989623 Not really a suitable job for a young girl…
6192354999991351 Capella
6192354999991352 You are Artemy Burakh. Greetings.
6192354999991353 Greetings to you, too. Are you Olgimsky's daughter?
6192354999991354 You know my name?
6192354999991355 I can <i>see.</i> I haven't yet mastered the art, but… I do see things, sometimes. It's a gift I inherited from my dear mother.
6192354999991356 You haven't mastered the art of… sight?
6192354999991357 Are you talking about clairvoyance, or what?
6192354999991358 Yes. My name is Victoria, but friends call me Capella.
6192354999991359 Well, are we friends?
6192354999991360 Yes.
6192354999991361 Really? How did you figure it out so fast?
6192354999991362 I mean… It's hard to explain. Sometimes I know what a person will say, before they say it. Or I imagine a situation, and the next day it unfolds exactly how it was in my head. \nSometimes I even know past events I wasn't present for, like which drawer Father put papers into years ago.
6192354999991363 A powerful gift, if you're telling the truth.
6192354999991364 Not that powerful, not with me. Not like my mother. She could see at will, although even with her, it could be fickle.\nI only see rarely, and I don't control it at all.
6192354999991365 I see, I see.
6192354999991366 I'd like such a gift, myself.
6192354999991367 Mother said it would pass. I'll either see by my own will, or lose it entirely.
6192354999991368 …Or you'll start seeing ghosts and unicorns.
6192354999991369 Better to lose it, then.
6192354999991370 Your undue sarcasm has been noted. It's not so rare a gift in this town. There were once several women who could see. Mother. Nina Kaina. Katerina Saburova, perhaps. Outsiders arrive with such skepticism, but they are always soon astonished.
6192354999991371 Astonish me, then.
6192354999991372 So it's common? One weirdo already told me I'll—
6192354999991373 —drown the town in blood.
6192354999991374 You two swap notes, or what?
6192354999991375 You likely aren't afraid of blood. Right?
6192354999991376 Of course not. I'm a surgeon.
6192354999991377 I absolutely am. Who isn't?
6192354999991378 Do you know what I see? Under your feet, the hard soil acts as though spring melt, each step forming an imprint filled with red. You leave pools of clotted blood in your wake, Artemy Burakh. \nI thought this must be about the murders, but you are no murderer. What does it all mean?
6192354999991379 You're asking me? I have no idea.
6192354999991380 All bullshit. You have some imagination.
6192354999991381 Why have you come? Are you looking for my brother, perhaps? Or do you want me to ask something of my father?
6192354999991382 I need nothing. I sense sadness in your eyes. Have you been crying?
6192354999991383 Do people often come to you as an in-between for Big Vlad?
6192354999991384 Your brother? Why would I?
6192354999991385 Oh… our family is falling apart. Father and Brother argue all the time, louder and crueler with each passing day. \nBrother is angry with me… Everything went awry after Mother's death.
6192354999991386 She was holding the family together, huh?
6192354999991387 Everyone loved your mother. I was just a kid, but I remember her, too.
6192354999991388 Why is your brother angry with you?
6192354999991389 She died when I was six. On the day of her funeral, I locked myself in with the coffin, so that no one could take her away from me. \nThat evening, Brother explained there was no other way: The dead must be buried. That is best for them, he said. And then I understood.
6192354999991390 They do need it.
6192354999991391 But how did your brother make you sad?
6192354999991393 How many years have passed? Nine, almost. Still I walk the house as though she's here. I leave out the last piece of pie. Looking out windows, I move aside so that she, too, can see. I even fold the corner of her bed.
6192354999991394 You need a doctor. All this sounds unhealthy.
6192354999991395 You need to let go of the dead, kid.
6192354999991396 To me, she's not dead. If I don't think of her that way, we stay together.
6192354999991397 Are you sure she would want this?
6192354999991398 You speak with such pain because of your father's death. I'm sorry… I truly mean that.
6192354999991400 All right. Let us leave our dearly departed in peace.
6192354999991401 Yes. Father pays heed to what I ask of him. Tells me I'm the only person he loves. That's because I take after Mother.
6192354999991402 My condolences.
6192354999991403 I thought he loved no one.
6192354999991404 Brother acts against Father's will. Your Kin make up most of Father's workforce. But he… he doesn't treat them well. \nSo Brother argues with him, but Father hates to be challenged. He says he'll disinherit my brother.
6192354999991405 …Making you the heiress. Right?
6192354999991406 Where's your brother now? I'd like to meet him.
6192354999991407 I don't know. He seems to do business with everyone. Knows everything. \nAs for the family business, he… well… deals with steppe people. That's why Father is often angry with him.
6192354999991408 Why would he be angry about that?
6192354999991409 Wrong! Mother never wanted that, and Father honors her will. Still does…
6192354999991410 Another family torn apart. Your brother… Is he home?
6192354999991411 I think he's in the Broken Heart now. In the Earth district. Actually, he frequents the place… ever since Mother died.
6192354999991412 I see.
6192354999991442 Did something happen? You look worried.
6192354999991443 I want to ask you something.
6192354999991444 What? Have you had more nightmares about me?
6192354999991445 No. I told you, it doesn't happen often. Once a month, maybe, or every few months.
6192354999991446 Did you know my father well? Did you talk much?
6192354999991447 Yes. Of course.
6192354999991448 He wrote this note… Here, take a look. Why are these names listed together? Yours is on here, too.
6192354999991449 Go ahead.
6192354999991450 He wrote this note… Here, take a look. Why are these names listed together? Yours is on here, too.
6192354999991751 …I don't know, but I have a suspicion.
6192354999991752 Why are you frowning? Is it something bad?
6192354999991753 Are you all going to die soon?
6192354999991754 Were you his patients?
6192354999991755 …It's not about money, is it?
6192354999991756 Well, no. About a year ago, your father began to seek our company. We all met together, sometimes, or in twos or threes. It happened naturally.\nHe… taught us, I suppose, but not anything special. I think it was more about passing down something… something of great importance.
6192354999991757 I can't make heads or tails of what you're saying.
6192354999991758 You're an outsider. It's difficult to explain. We kids have our own town within the Town. A separate one. And we govern it on our own.\nDon't give me that patronizing look! It's not some game. You… you wouldn't understand anyway!
6192354999991759 Go on, please. I'll do my best.
6192354999991760 I grew up here. I knew all this before you learned the alphabet.
6192354999991761 Fine. Do you want to know why your father spent time with us, or not?
6192354999991762 Yes, I do.
6192354999991763 Your father was… shrewd. "He can see beneath crude earth, petty lies, and hard truths," Khan used to say. Khan didn't like him much, but even he got out of the Polyhedron to talk to him…\nHe believed we were the ones who would remake this town. Rebuild and conduct it. In the future.
6192354999991764 "Remake"? You mean destroying this town?
6192354999991765 A fisher of men. Never know he had that in him.
6192354999991766 "Conduct" the town? Did you mean "govern," or what?
6192354999991767 No. A town is like music. You must play, writing the composition as you go, all while minding the harmony. Are you a musical person?
6192354999991768 I am. Well, I love it, at least.
6192354999991769 Unfortunately, I'm not.
6192354999991770 I don't know. Perhaps it doesn't need to be so drastic. Although… the more I think about it, the more disturbing it sounds. Perhaps there is a catastrophe upon us? Rumor has it, the war moves eastward. And it won't end… Perhaps something is about to happen? God forbid, of course.
6192354999991771 Do you even believe in God?
6192354999991772 Everything ends, sooner or later. So will the war.
6192354999991773 That's what he was preparing us for. Changing the Town. I can see it now.\nHe taught each of us something important. Perhaps… perhaps he gave a piece of himself to us. Yes. That must be what he did.
6192354999991774 Well. Guess I'll keep an eye on you all.
6192354999991775 Oh, Dad. "I shall not wholly vanish, no." Always the sly fox…
6192354999991776 Guess I'll have to protect you from all evils, then.
6192354999991777 No, I don't. What about you?
6192354999991778 Wow. You didn't even hesitate.
6192354999991779 Neither do I.
6192354999991780 Girls your age usually say, oh, I believe there's <i>some</i> higher power.
6192354999991860 Guests are always welcome here.
6192354999991861 Why do you live here and not the Tower across the river?
6192354999991862 I see you're not in the mood for guests right now.
6192354999991863 The Tower of Orphans? It's not for me. I hate it.
6192354999991864 So that's what you call it?
6192354999991865 Why?
6192354999991866 That's not how one builds a kingdom. \nKingdoms are built on love and care. Be generous with those, and where you are, there a kingdom will gather.
6192354999991867 Does the Tower interfere with that, somehow?
6192354999991868 It separates children from their parents. Breaks families. Tears connections. \nWhen connections are torn, life cannot thrive. Does a leg thrive with cut veins? Do mushrooms thrive when torn from mycelium?
6192354999991869 I know. This is the steppe teaching of the Lines.
6192354999991870 First off, that's not how mycelium works.
6192354999991871 Perhaps… What I mean is, that tower is about tearing things apart. That's what the Kains built it for. They believe fractures are good for the soul.\nI think otherwise. That tower is the root of many evils.
6192354999991872 Such as?
6192354999991873 Huh. I kind of like it.
6192354999991874 No one knows what goes on there. I can hear the tune of the rat-catcher, his vibrations calling, luring, but I don't know what he desires.\nYou know, surely, the initiative to collect infants came from the Polyhedron? That they won't let in adults?
6192354999991875 You mean they <i>suggested</i> it, right? It's not like they can order around Saburov.
6192354999991876 Why won't they let in adults?
6192354999991877 Orders aren't needed. An idea only needs to take shape… That's how it always works with the Kains.\nVictor is too lenient with Khan, especially after Sinister Nina died. Khan is his beloved son, after all. The Kains' main heir, the family's hope.
6192354999991878 I see.
6192354999991879 Shame they're not too eager to see me.
6192354999991880 They just don't.\nSee, this is how the Tower works. Everyone just knows the adults aren't allowed. No one questions it, no one even bothers to gossip about it. That's the way things are, and everyone accepts it. And then, when their children are torn away from them, they shed tears.
6192354999991881 Sounds odd.
6192354999991882 That's just the kind of town we live in.
6192354999995490 Changeling
6192354999996359 What do you want, Ripper? Are you trying to catch the White Mistress, too? \nIt's futile, Burakh. She won't help anyone anymore. Won't save anyone.
6192354999996360 Why are you here?
6192354999996361 Was that you playing?
6192354999996362 I'm running the same errand you are. Looking for Mother Victoria. And getting paid handsomely for it, by the way. Are you? I am.\nSo here I am, playing. Perhaps someone will respond. But it's futile. No one does. Well, you did, but what use do I have for a moron like you?
6192354999996363 So it wasn't her soul…
6192354999996364 …So there is no afterlife. Not even in this form.
6192354999996365 So it wasn't.
6192354999996366 …So there's no White Mistress anymore?
6192354999996367 That's what I thought.
6192354999996368 So there isn't. In any shape or form. Did you really hope for something different?
6192354999996369 …Is there an immortal soul?
6192354999996370 I guess I did.
6192354999996371 Perhaps there is. But I doubt it.
6192354999996372 I thought you'd know for sure.
6192354999996373 And they call you kind… a saint, even.
6192354999996374 Perhaps I do. Do you really want to?\nYou don't. Live with hope, Burakh. It's more comforting that way.
6192354999996375 Fair enough.
6192354999996376 I'll relay this to Capella.
6192354999996377 Just… don't you dare tell Capella that. Or I'll snap your neck.
6192355000000351 
6192355000000352 
6192355000000353 I have the key to my home now.
6192355000000354 
6192355000000355 
6192355000000356 I have a key to a secret Factory building. Handy. I can't always sleep at other people's places, after all.
6192355000000357 
6192355000000358 
6192355000000359 Olgimsky's son, Vlad Jr., had granted my father access to a secret room below one of the Factory buildings. I feel it will become my new home.
6192355000000360 The poor orphan took the rustling of herbs for the voices of the dead. \n\nI don't have it in me to even get mad. But I do have a pocketful of herbs now.
6192355000000361 
6192355000000362 
6192355000000363 The contraption in the Lair can be used to produce herbal tinctures.
6192355000002451 Listen, Burakh. I'm in trouble. I was cursed yesterday.
6192355000002452 Well, what do I have to do with it?
6192355000002453 I'm surprised it only happened yesterday.
6192355000002456 This is the doing of your steppe butchers. Your rippers. You're a ripper. So you must know how to undo it.
6192355000002457 Undo what?
6192355000002458 Butchers don't curse anyone.
6192355000002459 I'm not a "ripper."
6192355000002462 There's a man around town who can divine the future by reading entrails. A steppe haruspex. He dissects the dead… or dying… and tells the future.\nThey say he's always right. Got a ton of clients. And… well, here we are.
6192355000002463 So is it the dead or dying?
6192355000002464 "Here" where?
6192355000002465 Why the fuck should you care? There's no salvation from the sand pest! They're all walking corpses, anyway.\nThis way, at least, they serve the living.
6192355000002466 And the living in question would be you, yes?
6192355000002467 So I called upon his services. There was this… thing… that I really, very much needed to know.\nAnd now I've got this… heart. I've tried to throw it away, drown it in the Gullet <i>and</i> the Guzzle, bury it…\nBut it always comes back! I keep finding it in my bag, or in my bed, or in my pocket. I just thrust my hand there, and, and…
6192355000002468 Ah… I know this curse. It happened to me when I was a kid, too.
6192355000002469 Get lost.
6192355000002470 I think you ought to share this with the changeling girl. Sounds like her area of expertise.
6192355000002471 Burakh, it only happened because that… cutter, I mean, your colleague, wasn't a <i>true</i> haruspex. He didn't actually know those Lines of yours. Or so I am told!\nBut you do! Help me, Burakh, please! I promise I'll be good from now on!
6192355000002472 Will you?
6192355000002473 Piss off.
6192355000002476 I am good, Burakh! I had no idea he'd kill someone! Please! I'm basically on my knees here!
6192355000002477 Fine. Shut up. This heart of yours can't be thrown away. Only traded. Do you have it on you?
6192355000002478 Yes.
6192355000002479 Hold it in your hand tightly. Close your eyes. What do you see?
6192355000002480 I have no idea how to deal with this.
6192355000002481 Good, huh? Yeah, you're Changeling material.
6192355000002482 I see… my beautiful face… no, wait. I see a spindle of sorts.
6192355000002483 Fine. If I find a spindle, I'll trade it to you.
6192355000002484 Here you go. And never do that again.
6192355000002485 But what did you want to know?
6192355000002486 Whether I'll survive.
6192355000002487 Ah, well, that I can tell you for free: outlook not so good.
6192355000002488 You? Oh, you will. Everyone else may drop dead, but the likes of you always weasel their way through.
6192355000002489 What chemist?
6192355000002490 Hell if I know. Haven't met him yet. But it's not like there are ten different pharmacies in the Atrium, anyway.
6192355000002491 What's the job? Working with dead bodies?
6192355000002751 
6192355000002752 
6192355000002753 
6192355000002754 
6192355000002755 
6192355000002756 
6192355000002757 
6192355000002758 
6192355000002759 
6192355000002760 
6192355000002761 
6192355000002762 
6192355000002763 
6192355000002764 
6192355000002765 
6192355000002768 
6192355000002769 
6192355000002770 
6192355000002771 
6192355000002772 
6192355000002773 
6192355000002774 
6192355000002775 
6192355000002776 
6192355000002777 
6192355000002778 
6192355000002779 
6192355000004059 Is it urgent?
6192355000004060 Your chemist provides services to people who don't want to bury their dead.
6192355000004061 What do you Kains want?
6192355000004063 My chemist? We don't have a chemist.
6192355000004064 He embalms dead bodies. Turns houses into tombs.
6192355000004065 Same as everyone. To curb the outbreak and get on with our lives. To turn this town into the best place on earth. \nAnything else I can help you with?
6192355000004066 No. Goodbye.
6192355000004067 It's just you all pursue such strange things.
6192355000004068 Then why does your chemist help spread the disease?
6192355000004069 Your father has been arguing with my older brother about it for years. Now is not the time to follow their example. We have more urgent business.
6192355000004070 Agreed. It would be nice to rein in your overly zealous chemist, for example.
6192355000004071 He says you endorse his actions. Living people are sharing their homes with the dead now. Are you happy?
6192355000004072 …If I'd learned about this earlier, I would have torn his head off already.\nNow give me thirty-five seconds of silence, please. I need to think.
6192355000004073 …
6192355000004074 Thank the gods… I almost believed it.
6192355000004075 Me too.
6192355000004076 The Cemetery is overcrowded… I see. The caretaker girl forbids mass graves, and stirs unrest… Yes. I've received these reports. People hide their dead to avoid having them burned… Corpses multiply in living rooms… Does the infection linger in dead bodies?
6192355000004077 Possibly.
6192355000004078 Most likely.
6192355000004079 I don't know. I'm a surgeon.
6192355000004080 How will you go about the search?
6192355000004081 You can tell a house where dead bodies are hidden by the sound.
6192355000004092 You poor, poor house… In a way, your kind are like teeth. You know how they pull teeth out? Sometimes, a dead tooth can be left in place. Other times, it needs immediate extraction.\nDo you think this one needs…?
6192355000004093 What are you doing here, pretty girl?
6192355000004094 Did you come to mark this house?
6192355000004095 Well, now I'll have to.
6192355000004096 What happened here?
6192355000004097 When the cough started, they began avoiding me. And then they locked me here alone! Yes, I'm sick, but not with this terrible plague! It's just a cold! Flu, maybe… Go ahead and examine me!\nJust… no quarantine, please! And don't mark this house!
6192355000004099 Don't you know? New order. Quarantine. Forbidden for people to go outside. Yet here we are… Our neighbors want to hide this from the authorities. They're afraid of the quarantine. Terrified, even.
6192355000004100 You can go outside. No one will stop you.
6192355000004101 Why did they lock you up?
6192355000004103 I'm sorry.
6192355000004104 They must have their reasons.
6192355000004105 I'm not a digger, either. I'm a surgeon.
6192355000004106 Digging is not exactly popular here. Living earth cult. Nothing but the graveyard will do.
6192355000004107 You said it yourself, emshen. A new graveyard right in the middle of town. Quite a story for you to tell back at the Capital.
6192355000004108 Very funny, Burakh. But enough joking… Now I have to really think about solving this issue.
6192355000004109 Burn the corpses.
6192355000004110 Stop the epidemic. That solves everything.
6192355000004128 How about letting the tenants back in and asking them?
6192355000004129 I remember when you were just a kid. Who could have thought you'd grow into… <i>this?</i>
6192355000004130 Don't "pretty girl" me, you peasant. Shoo! Wait outside until I finish.\nIt won't take long now. This house is inessential and ugly. I'm crossing it off.
6192355000004131 What is that supposed to mean?
6192355000004132 So the cross on the door is your doing?
6192355000004133 I'm not talking to you, <i>cocoon man.</i>\nDon't get mad at me, dear house, but you have to go. It's not the people who need curing, but the Town itself. Too much filler. That's the cause of the outbreak. Oh, house… If you're still alive, if you still hear me, I sincerely hope you'll understand.
6192355000004134 So you're planning to demolish this house? On what grounds?
6192355000004135 Victor harshly punishes anyone who interferes with the sanitary procedures.
6192355000004136 "Cocoon man"?
6192355000004137 Well, you're no butterfly, are you? No wings. No color. No imagination.
6192355000004138 But you've got all that in spades. Enough of your games.
6192355000004139 Get a load of this, dear house! This man must be a complete fool. He thinks I follow anyone's rules.\n…But you can't hear me, can you? You're unwanted. Unliving. So I hereby sentence you to emptiness. I'm sorry.
6192355000004140 I'm sorry, too, but I <i>will</i> put an end to what you're doing.
6192355000004141 On the grounds that I hate it. Be so kind as to shut your trap. Your coarse voice distracts me. Your hideous smell troubles me.\nYour smell… Blood, formaldehyde, iron, as expected. Steppe herbs, surprise, wrath… Oh, would you look at that! This beast is getting angry!
6192355000004142 You clearly weren't spanked enough as a child. That can be fixed.
6192355000004143 As will your father.
6192355000004144 I think you meant "goon," not "cocoon." The former fits me better. Get out.
6192355000004145 Truly your mother's daughter.
6192355000004146 Yes, pretty girl, you must obey the rules. You'll learn that soon enough.
6192355000004147 Not really. Just here to catch my breath.
6192355000004148 Is it urgent?
6192355000004149 Your daughter is out of control. She's marking houses with crosses on a whim.
6192355000004150 Not really. Just here to catch my breath.
6192355000005551 I'll put a stop to that.
6192355000005552 She doesn't believe you will.
6192355000005553 Good, that's all I wanted to hear.
6192355000005554 She's struggling with our family's tragedy. Maria took Simon's death very much to heart. She believes it put new responsibilities on her. How did she explain her actions?
6192355000005555 I'm not sure. She was talking to the house.
6192355000005556 Responsibility…?
6192355000005557 She believes that the time has come for her to replace her mother. \nI don't suppose you remember Nina well, but she was the heart of this town. Its author. Its spirit. Its power. She could breathe life into inanimate objects. Literally. Do you know what I'm talking about?
6192355000005558 Not really.
6192355000005559 I do.
6192355000005560 Maria sees… meaningful dreams. We never ignore them. But she doesn't yet know how to interpret them. She takes valuable information and draws incorrect conclusions.\nDid she tell you that the Town itself is causing the outbreak?
6192355000005561 She said it has a lot of filler.
6192355000005562 She said houses are living beings.
6192355000005563 And you most assuredly do not agree. You take it for the wild fantasies of an unbalanced girl. Yet I am positive there is a grain of truth to her thinking, and you will soon bear witness to that.\nBut let's set this aside. I will put a stop to her.
6192355000005564 My job was to warn you. The rest is up to you.
6192355000005566 Don't be too harsh on her.
6192355000005567 People were scared of Nina, that much I remember.
6192355000005568 I have no intention to debate my wife with you. Is that clear?
6192355000005569 Sorry.
6192355000005570 Oh, in no uncertain terms.
6192355000012651 
6192355000012751 An epidemic, Burakh… Plague. And if it's the sand plague that smothered three hundred of my workers five years ago, then it's serious… very serious, my boy. Your father saved us back then. \nBut now… now I need you… at hand. Do I make myself clear?
6192355000012752 What's going on here?
6192355000012753 Clear as day. A family doctor. A tame doctor. Right?
6192355000012754 What epidemic?
6192355000012755 You know, Burakh… In olden days, pirates used to hunt ships that carried doctors… because they were worth more than gold. Imagine that! \nAnd I'm a bit of an old pirate myself… heh heh. Be prudent, my boy. Surely you appreciate your… value… now.
6192355000012756 I sure do. So unfortunately I will have to decline, boös. I have my own business to attend to.
6192355000012757 I'm not your boy, boös.
6192355000012758 I will help your family, boös—if you can help mine.
6192355000012759 You don't understand yet… You're a bull-headed, stubborn young man. But you will. When a three-body-thick pile of corpses lies atop Isidor's… maybe we will talk again.
6192355000012760 Who is going to be in charge now?
6192355000012761 That's of no concern to you, Burakh. Everything important that could be done… I've done already. \nThere will be a Fund. There will be a headquarters… intrigues… sleepless nights. Everyone here thinks they're crucial to defeating the outbreak… but they're scared. Mistaken. What can they tell you?
6192355000012762 I'm a doctor. I need the full picture.
6192355000012764 Sand plague. Sand pest, as we called it back then. Lethal… Everyone who got sick died. No survivors. And contagious, Burakh… Very much so.
6192355000012765 How do you know it's the same thing?
6192355000012766 Perhaps it will pass.
6192355000012767 Is this a medical meeting? Why wasn't I invited?
6192355000012768 So you have some time on your hands? Then go to each of them… Talk to one, two, three people… Fill your head with minutiae. While time… time is running out. Your time! \nSeven empty conversations… You don't need them. I can tell you all you need to know.
6192355000012769 That's all right, I'll manage. An hour of talking is fine. Let me in.
6192355000012770 It's your fault. You should have invited me from the start.
6192355000012771 Fair enough. I'm not big on chatter. What do I need to know?
6192355000012772 We have four doctors. Well… three, you excluded. They'll work on the epidemic. The headquarters will be here. All your actions… I mean, their actions… will be accounted for and rewarded by the Anti-Epidemic Fund. \nI like incentivizing… entrepreneurship. If you work well, you are paid well. So rest assured, they won't sit on their hands.
6192355000012773 Me excluded? Why?
6192355000012774 I have my own plans for you.
6192355000012775 Fair enough. You can count on me, boös.
6192355000012776 Got it.
6192355000012777 Nice. I happen to be out of cash.
6192355000012778 Let me make myself clear: In this war, I'm on the frontlines. Got it?
6192355000012779 But I have mine.
6192355000012780 Fear tightly grips my master, sir. He wishes, as you so frightf'ly know, to keep you close at hand, so that you may be near his children. 'Tis just in case. But we know it won't help: No one can cure the sand plague.
6192355000012781 Your master can rot for all I care.
6192355000012782 Father could do it, I think.
6192355000012783 What should I do, Reflection?
6192355000012784 Burakh, I reckon… It will be you who saves us from this pest. Who saves those who survive to witness your triumph. Your name's Burakh; so I know you'll wear out your fingers working. By the by, mind the fund he spoke of earlier… You should know how it works.
6192355000012785 Speak, Reflection.
6192355000012786 I don't care. I refused my legacy.
6192355000012787 A doctor like yourself is paid each night with some fair sum we take from the Pest Fund. Whether our Master likes or loathes you. He is, indeed, a man whose word is bond. Stay at the lump or not: The Fund will pay you for your deeds.
6192355000012788 That's nice to hear.
6192355000012789 But money is depreciating as we speak…
6192355000012792 How will he know of my actions?
6192355000012793 The Fund is not cared for purely by Master. All hands in town have staked on its success. You doctors will be watched closely…
6192355000012794 I always dreaded notoriety.
6192355000012795 Inflation will be tallied up with care. There's yet plenty of heft to Master's purse, and more gold yet from Kains and Saburovs: They share in the Bull Enterprise.
6192355000012796 I know.
6192355000012797 I don't need attention. At all.
6192355000012798 The founders of the Fund will find all faults; count up your deeds each night. The more you work the more you make… in hospital or street. Though I know not what they expect of you; mayhaps neither do they. Are you certain you wish to talk to them?
6192355000012799 Not at all. Too much rambling for one evening…
6192355000012801 Really?
6192355000012802 Yes. I can't stand being ignored.
6192355000017451 
6192355000017452 
6192355000017453 One of Notkin's boys is in trouble. If left unattended, he won't live to see the evening.
6192355000017454 
6192355000017455 
6192355000017456 
6192355000017460 
6192355000017461 
6192355000017462 Diagnostics is the father of treatment. To learn which antibiotic might help Patches, I first need to figure out which of his three Layers is sick.
6192355000017463 
6192355000017464 
6192355000017465 I made a herbal immune booster with father's contraption. This remedy can also be used to diagnose various internal issues in other people.
6192355000017466 
6192355000017467 
6192355000017468 My treatment helped Patches.
6192355000017469 
6192355000017470 
6192355000017471 I think it's time to pay a visit to the Lair.
6192355000017472 I came into my legacy. I traced Father's path and learned the voices of herbs. I entered his secret house and learned his craft. I will take care of his patients. I've proven by deeds that I know the Lines.\n\nI am a menkhu.
6192355000020251 
6192355000020252 
6192355000020254 There was a list of… patients, maybe?… in Father's vessel thing. These look like children's nicknames.\n\n1. Sticky\n2. Capella\n3. Murky\n4. Notkin\n5. Khan\n6. Grace\n7. Taya Tycheek\n8. [unfamiliar steppe sigil]
6192355000020255 
6192355000020256 
6192355000020257 Capella has created a union of kids. She might know what Father wanted with them.
6192355000020258 Father believed that the future of this town lies with its children and that each will improve it in their own way. Guess I should keep an eye on them in the future.
6192355000020259 
6192355000020260 Father believed that the children on his list are the key to the Town's future. Guess I should keep an eye on them in the future.
6192355000021051 The three ruling families will recruit volunteers to observe order. The dangerous districts will be cordoned off. Entry or exit will not be possible. Any crime against health or property will be punished immediately.
6192355000021052 What does that mean for me?
6192355000021053 Makes sense.
6192355000021054 You're a doctor, so you have privilege. Unlike others, you are allowed entry—and more importantly, exit—from infected areas. \nWe rely on your responsibility. If you discover you're infected, you won't attempt to conceal or spread it. Correct?
6192355000021055 Yes.
6192355000021056 If only it could be figured out at once…
6192355000021057 The hospital will be set up in the Theatre. Possible infected will be examined there every day. The disease will be studied, and we'll even try curing it. \nThey say there's no cure for the sand pest, but Doctor Dankovsky still has hope.
6192355000021058 What does that mean for me?
6192355000021059 The Theatre is a wise choice. Now is not the time for plays.
6192355000021060 An anatomy theatre, huh? You have a talent with puns.
6192355000021061 It means that the Theatre is your place now. Your real home. Tend to the sick, and dissect the dead. \nWork night and day to find a cure for this accursed plague.
6192355000021062 I was planning to.
6192355000021063 I'm not sure if this is the right place to find that cure.
6192355000021064 In that cesspool of infection? You'll have one fewer doctor in a couple of days.
6192355000021065 I know what you're thinking. You want to look for the murderer, avenge your father… \nForget it. Let me handle it. I'll do it better than you. Father would want you to work, not seek vengeance. Work in his stead.
6192355000021066 Let you handle it? Why in the world…?
6192355000021067 I know better than you what Father would want.
6192355000021068 What matters is what I want. Leave Father alone, Stakh.
6192355000021069 You failed him. You hesitated and left him in trouble. In my book, you have forfeited your right to revenge. Leave it to me. I can do better. And you… well, you're a better doctor than me.
6192355000021070 What does this mean for me?
6192355000021071 I'm <i>this</i> close to hitting you, Rubin.
6192355000021072 You're no longer a surgeon. You're a pharmacist. I'm better at dissecting people—in all senses, Burakh. But to create an infusion, like Isidor did… that requires your intuition. Your hands. It gives me no pleasure to admit all this, but it's true.
6192355000021073 Spare me your lectures, Stakh.
6192355000021074 No.
6192355000021075 I'll do whatever duty requires of me. Got it?
6192355000021076 This is humiliating… Father purposefully charges me with tasks that present our family in the ugliest possible light. \nSupplying the Fund with adequate food and medicine is clearly impossible. My efforts here are futile!
6192355000021077 Why?
6192355000021078 What does this mean for me?
6192355000021079 Going door to door and seizing people's stockpiles of medicine and food? Insanity. They won't hand it over, of course. They barely have anything left.
6192355000021080 How did this happen?
6192355000021081 No one knows why the train is almost a month late! We've maintained regular shipments of meat and skins—so where's our pay? Where's the regular supply train? \nWe're on the brink of starvation. There are no stocks left. Which means everyone's on their own now, and I will have to kneel in front of my father and take responsibility for this fiasco.
6192355000021082 Got it. The early bird gets the worm.
6192355000021083 They will, if you ask right.
6192355000021084 You're a smart man. You'll find a way.
6192355000021085 If it's the same sickness, all measures are pointless. Wishful thinking; delusional actions. For it's clear what we're dealing with. Fire from heaven. The Great Flood. No one shall be spared, save for the ten righteous men.
6192355000021086 But we need to fight. That's what makes life meaningful—whatever's left of it.
6192355000021087 You have a fever. You're delirious.
6192355000021088 …So what does that mean for me?
6192355000021089 Forget the plague. You can't affect it. Think of yourself, not of the disease. Search your soul. Are you a righteous man, or are you one of the cattle for the slaughter? Whom will it kill, and whom will it spare? And why? \nThis is the curious question which must be answered. By me, doctor, not you.
6192355000021090 Yeah, that much is clear.
6192355000021091 It is a curious thought, true. I'll consider it.
6192355000021105 But you are Olgimsky's private doctor now, aren't you? I guess he'll object, then. Or even forbid you to risk your life.
6192355000021106 Fair enough. My life just became very precious.
6192355000021107 Did he tell you that? Bullshit.
6192355000021108 I am my father's son. Olgimsky is no one to me.
6192355000021135 Ahh, Burakh. What a timely visit. This key is rightfully yours. It unlocks Factory Building 3, a place where your father used to do his work. Please take it. Just… no need to publicize our conversation, okay?
6192355000021136 Why?
6192355000021137 All right. Deal.
6192355000025551 I can't reach Taya for now.
6192355000025552 
6192355000025553 I can't reach Taya for now.
6192355000025554 The Termitary is locked. Perhaps I could convince its owner to let me in?
6192355000025555 
6192355000025556 The Termitary is locked. Perhaps I could convince its owner to let me in?
6192355000025557 I have no way to reach Khan Kain for now.
6192355000025558 
6192355000025559 Khan barely leaves the new building across the river. I can't reach him.
6192355000025560 Screw you.
6192355000026971 Maybe the herbs are wrong… But Old Man used these ones… But I guess I don't remember them all…
6192355000026972 What the hell are you doing?
6192355000026973 Put that back. And get away from the table!
6192355000026974 Listen here, you little… This is the last time you've touched my things without permission. Got it?
6192355000026975 Whaddya want from me? Can't you see I'm making a cure?
6192355000026976 For freckles?
6192355000026977 Wow. You must be a trained doctor.
6192355000026978 …Old Man could make any cure. A piece of this, a piece of that… An herbal tincture… He fixed everything, from dislocated joints to the blues.
6192355000026979 Yes, that's the kind of man Father was. You and I are in a different league.
6192355000026980 You're too young. I'll do it without you.
6192355000026985 I mean, you're in no hurry, right? So I'll make the cure myself. I remember some things… Maybe like a poultice, at least, so it wouldn't burn so bad.
6192355000026986 A poultice, huh? No. Poultices won't save us.
6192355000026987 You know, perhaps the burning is fine? If it helps someone survive.
6192355000026988 Shush! I'm thinking.
6192355000028238 
6192355000031151 Where have you been? We're drowning in work.
6192355000031152 You're a quick one, though.
6192355000032451 
6192355000032452 
6192355000033651 That's why I came. What do you need me to do?
6192355000033652 I have my own work to do.
6192355000033657 All right, genius, tell me. What's on your mind?
6192355000033658 Father knew how to make… concoctions. He mixed tissue with twyre infusions.
6192355000033659 You're a slow one.
6192355000033660 What do you do here?
6192355000033661 If the screams are any indication, the sand plague is painful. These people need care. Dirty care. Prosecting the dead, studying infected organs… Dankovsky's orders.\nWhat else can be done? We try different older medicines, study their effects. But the supply is short…
6192355000033662 Is that it?
6192355000033663 Exactly. So shouldn't we be making medicine?
6192355000033664 Autopsies? Teach the butchers. Dirty care… Important work, sure. But is that really the best use for my hands?
6192355000033665 I had more urgent business.
6192355000033667 Nothing yet.
6192355000033668 No, you're right. We need to observe the sick, work with the dead. There's no other way.
6192355000033669 Damn it, there's no time. It spreads fast, and kills quicker. I doubt it'll take a week to destroy everyone in the Town. If quarantines hold, ten days at best.
6192355000033670 So you're an optimist.
6192355000033671 Your father knew many things, true. But he didn't even have time to teach me, even though I was by his side all those years, sleeping on his floor like a dog. I tried my best, but this work requires a certain talent. Like his.\nAnd you? You learned nothing from him.
6192355000033673 So we'll have to rely on my talent.
6192355000033674 Who knows… Perhaps I did.
6192355000033675 I should have accepted the inheritance.
6192355000033676 I was with him in the First Outbreak. I know the sand plague. I'm no mystic, but… it's some punishment from heaven. More complex than disease.\nTo cure such an ill, one must <i>be</i> Isidor. But even he failed.
6192355000033677 He failed. I won't.
6192355000033678 So I will have to become him, then. Who else, after all.
6192355000033679 Blah blah! Empty words. Why are you always so arrogant? It always got under my skin.
6192355000033680 Father always said we should look for connections among things. That is how he made those mixtures.
6192355000033681 Then shouldn't we give up? Just try to survive and hope for the best.
6192355000033682 Fewer than that. We need to find another way.
6192355000033683 How do you know?
6192355000033684 It's all about mixtures, Rubin. The right mixtures of the right components.
6192355000033685 I'll follow the Lines. That's what makes me different from you.
6192355000033686 You're an idiot.
6192355000033687 <i>You're</i> an idiot.
6192355000033688 I agree. But I'm a stubborn idiot.
6192355000033689 You would need to become a teacher to accomplish that, but you chose to split away from your father. You're no Isidor, Cub.
6192355000033690 You're a broken record. Just trust me, like you once did. If you can.
6192355000033691 We'll see.
6192355000033692 You, on the other hand, have turned into his shadow. How does that help? Go on, wipe the foreheads of the ill. I can't listen to their screaming.
6192355000033693 …So? What's the plan? Did you lose your tongue?
6192355000033696 The plan… The plan is this. Do you know what a serum is, kid?
6192355000033697 Can we make that?
6192355000033698 Not you. But I can try. Though it takes time…
6192355000033699 Sure. We need someone who wouldn't die of the infection. But we haven't met anyone like that yet…
6192355000033700 We can… Regardless of whatever some <i>cocksure</i> doctors say.
6192355000033701 So now what? Where do we start?
6192355000033702 With infected organs. We need to inspect them more closely, and mix what we find with something else, too.
6192355000033703 This is my job, kid. But don't worry, I won't leave you behind.
6192355000033705 We start with deliberation, and only move to action after that.
6192355000033706 And what do you do now, I wonder? Seek a salve that will slay me? Oh, you dear, warm being… Are you sure you want to challenge me, earthly man?
6192355000033707 So, you are a living thing after all?
6192355000033710 Indeed. I am life itself.
6192355000033711 Never would I have guessed that.
6192355000033712 Oh, yes.
6192355000033713 I'm not here to pick a fight. I'm here to help the sick.
6192355000033714 Well said, Burakh! Indeed you know the Lines, if you see this clearly. You are no fool, unlike that Bachelor, or the Changeling. There is no helping them see truth. You, however, love life dearly.
6192355000033715 Do <i>you?</i>
6192355000033716 Everyone loves life.
6192355000033717 And what is the next step in this plot you weave? I would like to know.
6192355000033718 I'm making a cure.
6192355000033719 I'm not telling <i>you.</i>
6192355000033720 Is that so? And yet, all you touch dies.
6192355000033721 You jest, surely? You are like a bairn making stew from sod and bones. \nWhat was that red stuff? Guts from menfolk? Bah! Man-guts won't do, Burakh, oh no. Your bodies are weak. Try your foolish potion on someone, and you will see that it is worthless.
6192355000033722 This one might fail. The next one… who knows?
6192355000033723 There are other organic components out there. Something might work.
6192355000033724 Life finds a way, always. Sooner or later I'll find something to defeat you.
6192355000033725 You mean to test everything you can find? What wisdom! You should be done in forty years, if you live to reach such an age. \nI might cut short your woe, for I am not without kindness. The fool will die, and the wise shall receive my help.
6192355000033726 I don't mean to test <i>every</i> combination of ingredients.
6192355000033727 It won't take that long.
6192355000033728 You're much simpler than you like to think.
6192355000033730 I do not stand still, menkhu. I shift, and shift quickly. Will you race me?
6192355000033731 There must be something that affects all of your strains.
6192355000033732 You're lying, I can feel it. Get lost, I have a potion to test.
6192355000033733 All right. I'll give you a head start. Get lost.
6192355000033734 So when are we doing field work? I'm sick of sitting around here.
6192355000033735 Did you see that thing just now?
6192355000033736 Ironic.
6192355000033737 I've seen everything around here. I remember every corner. I could totally pawn my eyes now, 'cause I don't even need them anymore. \nSo will you take me to do fieldwork?
6192355000033738 So you didn't notice anything? At all?
6192355000033739 I guess there was a gust of wind. Like a draft. You forgot the door, maybe?
6192355000033740 That's what I thought.
6192355000033741 Why are you so eager?
6192355000033742 And the conversation? Did you hear it?
6192355000033743 …So you've made a sample, right? Are we going to test it or now?
6192355000033744 We need to find a sick person. An easier task than I'd like.
6192355000033745 <i>I</i> will. Not you.
6192355000033746 So you'll give your sample to the sick person, but then they need observation, right? I can help. Deal? I'll wear a face mask and everything…
6192355000033747 Observation is not required. We'll know the results immediately.
6192355000033748 Pffft. Big surprise. You know, I'll leave one day. At least the Old Man taught me about herbs. You don't care. You wouldn't even beat me if I broke rules.
6192355000033749 Oh, I can provide <i>that</i> kind of teaching all right.
6192355000033750 Patience.
6192355000035551 Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
6192355000035552 They'll be observed at the hospital.
6192355000035553 It's just the first sample. We're at the beginning of a long journey.
6192355000035554 What if it doesn't help? How will you know what to do next?
6192355000035555 I think I just got a new friend. They'll tell me.
6192355000035556 I'll look inside them when they die. Something's bound to change.
6192355000035557 Perhaps I'll ask Dankovsky.

6192355000062551 Prompter
6192355000068060 Notkin asks you to come by, big bear. Looks like our troubles hunt in packs.
6192355000068061 What's going on?
6192355000068062 One of our lads, Patches, came down with somethin' nasty. He's burning up, won't last long. That dandy doctor from the Capital examined him. Told us the pills would kill him for sure.
6192355000068063 How'd he even find you all?
6192355000068064 What do you mean, pills will kill him?
6192355000068065 Did he tell you anything else?
6192355000068066 Dunno, he just came sniffing about. Was looking for something. In the walls, in the kennels, even in the air.
6192355000068067 So why didn't he help?
6192355000068068 How should I know? He was rambling on about them being old and stale and 'tibiotic or something. That guy is a worthless fraud, he is. Wants to board us up inside our hideout and let us rot.
6192355000068069 Antibiotics.
6192355000068070 He said our place should be locked up, so we don't spread whatever Patches got. Maybe it's catching? If you ask me, I think Patches just ate some moldy crackers…
6192355000068071 So why didn't the dandy help you?
6192355000068072 Tell Notkin I'm on my way.
6192355000068073 Tell Notkin I'm on my way.
6192355000068074 I'm busy, kid. Find someone else to bother.
6192355000068075 Notkin told us: "Go and find the younger Burakh. If anyone can make sense of this mess, it's Isidor's son. That fancy weasel only thinks about boarding us up, so Burakh's our only hope."
6192355000068076 We'll see.
6192355000068077 I'm no therapist.
6192355000068078 Quit it with the praise already.

6192355000076080 We scrounged up all these pills from all over town. But the big-city doctor said Patches will die if we give him any… His body can't take the strain. \nBut you… You're going to try anyway, aren't you?
6192355000076081 Pills? Is this rat poison or something?
6192355000076082 He said those are antibiotics. Rambled on about them being old, stale, more harm than good… Said we need to know exactly what's wrong before we can use them. Patches is burning up like a lit match, but there's no knowing why…
6192355000076083 If we can't know what's wrong with him, what can I do? I deal in surgery…
6192355000076084 What makes you think I can do better than that dandy?
6192355000076085 Old Burakh would've had something for this. He used herbs to find out what's wrong with his patients. Used to say twyre reveals everything hidden in a body. \nCan you do that?
6192355000076086 I can do many things.
6192355000076087 Let's have a look at Patches.
6192355000076093 You're a doctor too, aren't you? You can heal him. Maybe you can cut away the illness… take out his appendish or something.
6192355000076094 Diagnosis is always the first thing, knucklehead. Always! You can't play medicine by ear!
6192355000076095 Should I cut off one of his legs, too, just to be safe?

6192355000087153 
6192355000109275 I'll have to brew a little something, first… Can he make it three hours?
6192355000109290 That big-city doctor was just here, too. Told me to pass a message on: "Don't waste your time on Patches, it's over for him. Instead, pull yourself together and come see me. I've got something important for you." That's it.
6192355000109291 That's what he said? He can get bent.
6192355000109292 And what do <i>you</i> think?
6192355000109293 Guess I'll go have a talk with the Bachelor… about the Hippocratic Oath, if nothing else.
6192355000109295 Get off my back, boy.
6192355000109296 Is he gonna make it?
6192355000109297 Hear his steady breathing? He'll live.
6192355000109298 \n…Is he gone?
6192355000109299 I'm afraid so.
6192355000109300 …The Bachelor was right. Patches was always a goner. He said it was some terrible illness. That there is no cure, and we all need to be quarantined. \nMaybe he wanted to talk to you about that. Are you going to see him now?
6192355000109302 Right, he was here. What did he want?
6192355000109303 I'm sorry, boy. I tried, but it wasn't enough.
6192355000109304 Sadly, the best-laid plans of mice and men oft go badly… as Grief likes to say.
6192355000109305 Too early to say. Time will tell.
6192355000109306 And that Bachelor said it was no use! I knew he was lying, the big-city grifter. "Impossible" this, "goner" that… Nonsense. Wanted you to abandon us and go see him about some urgent business instead.
6192355000109307 So he wanted me to abandon a patient in favor of chatting with him? Charming.
6192355000109308 Well he, uh… he told us things looked grim, and that you should drop everything to go talk to him. \nBecause, he said, it's a desperate situation and our lot has to be quarantined. He said you shouldn't even come here, so you don't catch it yourself!
6192355000109309 I see. I should pay the man a visit.
6192355000109310 I wonder what's so urgent…
6192355000109311 Your gang should stay put for now. Keep off the streets, all right?
6192355000109332 Well, he told us it was hopeless… We were worried you'd believe him and leave Patches to die. What did you give him, by the way? One of your old man's tinctures?
6192355000109333 No, this is one of my own… I have accepted his legacy.
6192355000109334 You're a shifty one, aren't you? You should have more faith in me.

6192355000126660 Sahba? Who is that?
6192355000126661 What's that supposed to mean?
6192355000126662 Our leader. Our protector. Our teacher. She loved your father, yargachin.
6192355000126663 I'm sorry.
6192355000126664 The children waited for your help, the help of a Burakh. You let them down. In honor of your name, Sahba did your work. It didn't go well. She paid with her life.
6192355000126665 What children? What are you talking about, Worm?
6192355000126666 Damn it! I wasn't fast enough!
6192355000126667 You are lost, yargachin. You misunderstand fate. You misunderstand your place in the Kin. Your role is Isidor's role. Become his heir, shuu dee.
6192355000126668 Bish. I do not want to.
6192355000126669 You have been crowned heir. Thank Sahba. You can avoid fate, but others will carry the burden. And it may break them, as it broke Sahba.
6192355000126670 Got it, Worm.
6192355000126674 I am to give you the udhar that contains your inheritance. Here it is. You can turn away from it, if you want. But if you do, do not be shocked when everything around you ceases to make sense.
6192355000126675 Bayarlaa. Now leave.
6192355000127475 I know best what my father would want from me.
6192355000127476 I can. And you can't force me to decide.

6192355000146851 Who are you?
6192355000146852 Just the milkman. Don't mind me.
6192355000146853 Who are you? You look weird.
6192355000146854 Artemy Burakh. Surgeon.
6192355000146855 What do you want? You look like you can hardly read. And I doubt you're into stargazing.
6192355000146856 Where's Daniil Dankovsky? He's staying here, right?
6192355000146857 Why would I introduce myself first? I don't talk to strangers.
6192355000146858 Why so rude? Where's your hospitality?
6192355000146859 My name is Artemy. Are we acquainted now?
6192355000146860 I'm Burakh. Local doctor. You must have heard of me.
6192355000146861 You lie. I know Burakh. He's twenty-five years older than you, and kind. And you smell of blood, like a wolf.
6192355000146862 Well… Things don't always turn out right. 
6192355000146863 Oh, like you've seen a lot of wolves. Outside of books.
6192355000146864 I'm Eva. Eva Yan. I've been allowed to live here for as long as I'd like.
6192355000146865 Is that so? I remember a time when this observatory actually was used.
6192355000146866 So this is like… the Kains' guesthouse?
6192355000146867 I guess you just appeared here spontaneously, huh?
6192355000146869 He… he isn't here. And he isn't coming. He's gone to the Town Hall. For a meeting. An important meeting. With doctors.
6192355000146870 Who's that walking upstairs, then? Pacing impatiently? Waiting for me?
6192355000146871 Why would he set up our meeting here, then?
6192355000146873 Just mice… No, I mean… uh… ghosts! Restless souls! There are lots of them here.
6192355000146874 Uh huh. Could've guessed that myself.
6192355000146879 Pretty huge mice, huh? You must be an excellent chef.
6192355000146880 Doctor Dankovsky ordered us to meet him here, by the house he's staying at. We've been waiting for half an hour, but he still isn't coming out. Meaning he's busy. So we wait. You will too.
6192355000146881 No way. I'm not waiting, I'm going in.
6192355000146882 Who are you?
6192355000146883 Volunteers. Orderlies. He made us put on these clothes and come to him.
6192355000146884 The man clearly has theatrical ambitions. Why did he make you wear… this?
6192355000146885 He has a strange sense of humor.
6192355000146886 Take these rags back to the Theatre and go home.
6192355000146887 Flea protection. He said we'd thank him soon. And we believe him.
6192355000146888 Well, aren't you a bunch of gullible fellows.
6192355000146889 Good that you're taking hygiene so seriously.
6192355000146890 Flea protection? This town hasn't had fleas in twenty years.
6192355000146920 He couldn't! He didn't! And you know what? You're not welcome in this house!
6192355000146921 Stop shaking. We need to talk business.
6192355000146922 You're a bad liar, sweetheart. I think I'll take a look upstairs.
6192355000146923 Happy now? Don't ever do that again.
6192355000146924 So he's off to the Town Hall, huh?
6192355000146925 Mice indeed. Sorry I didn't believe you.
6192355000146928 Uh huh. To the Town Hall. And then to the Theatre… He said he had an… important appointment…
6192355000146929 Right. One can tell at a glance that he's an avid theatregoer.
6192355000146930 Something isn't right here.
6192355000146931 …With some doctors, yes. I suppose that would be me.
6192355000146932 Well, off to the Town Hall.
6192355000146933 Earth warm your roots, emshen.
6192355000146934 Who are all these people, Sahba? What do they want?
6192355000146935 My legs aren't <i>that</i> crooked, khetey.
6192355000146936 They respect me, you see. I know not the Lines, but I sense Earth. I speak to them on her behalf. They believe I am made of soil, like shabnak-adyg, though they don't call me that.
6192355000146937 They ask strange questions, Sahba. Why do they come to you?
6192355000146938 So you are like a religious teacher, to the Kin. Did Father know?
6192355000146939 …No. I shielded him from this. Remember: It was I who loved him. I was not loved in return, for he regretted me coming into being… I reminded him of his bitter sin.
6192355000146940 What sin?
6192355000146941 The First Outbreak. Do you know how old I am? I first awoke five years ago, when it happened. There were many dead, and many of the dead were of our people, the Khatanghe. The Crude Sprawl is a poor district.
6192355000146942 But what were you shielding him from?
6192355000146943 What do these people want here?
6192355000146944 I teach the truth of the Kin to these people. I retell our old legends. I remind them of Boddho's will, of how the world is a body. I hear the Earth, and speak her will for them. I make sure they know where they came from, and where they are going. \nA sick people, a weak people needs this. Our future hangs by a thread.
6192355000146945 I've talked to them… I suppose I did your work for you.
6192355000146946 But what is your role in all this?
6192355000146947 From what is about to happen. Khatanghe want blood. \nHe was a kind man. He needed not to know of his people's anger. Of how he himself stoked that fury. They would never hurt him for what he had done; he was too venerated. But they will take it out on the Town.
6192355000146948 So you're all plotting rebellion?
6192355000146949 They don't seem angry to me… Confused, perhaps.
6192355000146950 I knew that would happen. You have done well, following the Lines.
6192355000149451 You think so? My answers were not the same you would have given them.
6192355000149452 Why were they asking me, then, and not you?
6192355000149453 Lines, Lines, what is it with you people and Lines? Ugh. I've hated this nonsense since I was a child.
6192355000149454 They believe they come here for advice. False. They have long since made up their minds. Now only their weakness sows doubt in them; we take on the burden of that doubt. Whatever we tell them, they'll do what they think is right.
6192355000149455 Yeah, I used to flip coins… I always knew what to do before the coin even fell, no matter which side was up.
6192355000149456 Is that your idea of help?
6192355000149457 They are helping us, not the other way around. The question matters, not the answer; to the listener, not the speaker. They carry their own stories; you carry yours. Such is the truth of the Lines, tangher. The Truth of the Earth.
6192355000149458 You're a good teacher indeed.
6192355000149459 I'll… give this some thought.
6192355000149460 I disagree, Sahba.
6192355000151852 
6192355000151853 
6192355000153098 What an interesting place.
6192355000153099 Who are you?
6192355000153126 Kharaalai, I'm in trouble. My sister disappeared. Have you seen her? She has four moles on her cheek. I fear she may have ended up in the Slicer House. They'll sell her piece by piece now…
6192355000153127 What Slicer House?
6192355000153128 Beshe. I haven't seen her.
6192355000153129 A bad place in the Town, behind the Guzzle. Var lives there, a chemist. He buys body parts—sells them, too. Many know, but none act.
6192355000153131 I don't know him.
6192355000153132 I know him.
6192355000153135 They say that we kill people and bring Var the guts. That's always been a lie. But now? I'm not sure… Where else could my sister be?
6192355000153136 Who knows. You'll find her.
6192355000153137 Perhaps she was killed during the witch hunt.
6192355000153138 I think I should pay a visit to the Slicer House. Might be useful...
6192355000153139 Have you been to the governor? About the patrols, I mean? The pay is good, but… too good, actually. Suspicious. What's going on with that?
6192355000153140 What patrol?
6192355000153141 Not my kind of work. I'm too impatient.
6192355000153142 If you're in doubt, flip a coin.
6192355000153143 All strong men—who aren't cowards—should report to the Town Hall, it went. They might even announce an emergency situation. I wonder why? A revolt at the Factory, maybe? It's not working. Hear the silence?
6192355000153144 I guess they haven't caught the murderer yet. Perhaps they need people for a raid.
6192355000153145 So the governor's in the Town Hall? Got it.
6192355000153146 Fat Vlad said the Olgimskys got you in their pocket. Tell me, then, the hell's going on at his Factory! Why'd it shut down? Will we still be paid?
6192355000153147 Olgimsky thinks I belong to him? Did I hear you right?
6192355000153148 I don't know anything. I don't work there.
6192355000153149 He said you're his protégé, that no one touch you. Means he has plans.
6192355000153150 Oh, so he's got plans, that damn fat cat.
6192355000153351 I tried to help Patches, but failed. At least I made an attempt, I suppose.
6192355000153352 
6192355000153353 I had less time than I expected.
6192355000153354 According to Notkin, Bachelor Dankovsky has deemed me worthy of speaking with him and wants to see me at once. I wonder what for?
6192355000153355 
6192355000153356 Bachelor Dankovsky has deemed me worthy of speaking with him and wants to see me at once. Must be something serious.
6192355000153357 Eva swears that Dankovsky is in the Town Hall. Well, that's not hard to check.
6192355000153358 Something is very wrong. The alarm is coming from the Town Hall. I should hurry there.
6192355000153359 Eva swears that Dankovsky is in the Town Hall. Well, that's not hard to check.
6192355000155051 I see. I'll have to take care of that, then.
6192355000155052 Exactly. So leave me alone.
6192355000155053 Hey! We just paid respects to your father at the cemetery. You know if you don't go there within the hour, he's gonna get turned into kindling?
6192355000155054 …Turned into kindling?
6192355000155056 Damn it!
6192355000155057 They refuse to bury him. You didn't hear? I think it's blasphemy, myself.
6192355000155058 Shut up. I'm on my way.
6192355000155059 Who would refuse…? No, don't tell me. I'll figure it out.
6192355000155060 Grace says Mom still hasn't forgiven me. It's been two years since she died, but the grudge lives on.
6192355000155061 How does Grace know?
6192355000155062 Who is Grace?
6192355000155063 She talks to the dead. I swear. She can press her ear to the ground, fall asleep, and wake up with news. It's a gift, 'cause she's nutso. Her dad was addicted to twyrine. Her mom, too, even while she carried Grace.
6192355000155064 You swear? I guess I should check.
6192355000155065 Seems someone needs to find a better place for the girl…
6192355000155067 The air in the Hindquarters has turned foul. Heavy, viscous air… Some rift opened in the ground, maybe? I'm not sure.
6192355000155068 Death has arrived there. That's why.
6192355000155069 Must be some sort of vapor…
6192355000155070 I need to talk to Khan at the Tower. Though, the Town is all abuzz now, makes me kinda reluctant to leave.
6192355000155071 What Tower?
6192355000155072 Oh, all this is so very interesting.
6192355000155073 You blind, big fella? Just look over there. The Tower across the river… Our Polyhedron. The only place where life is real.
6192355000155074 Khan… I know the name. He's in the Tower?
6192355000155075 When was that thing even built? it wasn't here when I left.
6192355000155076 Our Taya is in the Termitary, isn't she? Why was it locked? Will they open it soon?
6192355000155077 I don't know. I think they will.
6192355000155078 Wait a second. What Taya? Taya Tycheek?
6192355000155079 Taya Tycheek. But we call her the Mother Superior. Mother Superior! Isn't that cool as heck? It's Capella's idea!
6192355000155080 It's cool, all right. Cool as heck. But I need to talk to her.
6192355000155081 It's a mouthful.
6192355000155088 My wife was killed yesterday. How can I look our children in the eyes now? I've lost the right to be called their father.
6192355000155089 Why?
6192355000155090 I'm sorry.
6192355000155091 I promised her we'd share every joy, every woe. I promised to protect her. What use is that now? What use are words without action?!
6192355000155092 That's… kind of true.
6192355000155096 What could you have done?
6192355000155097 I could have been… assertive. Think faster when it went down. I could have acted quickly, efficiently, instead of staying in my head! If only…
6192355000155098 Stop whining.
6192355000155099 You know? This is true for me, too. I need to be bolder.
6192355000155100 What's done is done. Live on, pal. For the children.
6192355000155101 See you tonight at Sahba's place? It's dangerous, yes… This is <i>ngan-pa dgu-’dzoms,</i> a place you must not bring outsiders.\nEveryone's looking for a shabnak-adyg. It's good they forgot Sahba.
6192355000155102 I'm an outsider. Why are you telling me this?
6192355000155103 Do you go there every night?
6192355000155104 You're Kin, Khatangher. Sahba talked about you a lot these days. We waited for you, yargachin.
6192355000155105 In that case, you can wait some more.
6192355000155106 The Kin can even live there. People come and go, yes.
6192355000155107 So will I.
6192355000155108 So, I'm Kin to you?
6192355000155109 Your meetings don't fit into my plans.
6192355000155110 Got it.
6192355000164251 Did you know folks are murdering women in the street? Those are your men, Bad Grief! Yours!
6192355000167822 Do you have dynamite?
6192355000167823 What for?
6192355000167824 I wanna blow up the railroad tracks.
6192355000167825 They say an inquisitor's coming. We should keep them from getting in, don't you think?
6192355000167826 Just nostalgic. Remember how we used to put bullets on train tracks?
6192355000167827 I see, I see…\nListen, artilleryman. You're a surgeon, not a bomber. Gotta be careful with those hands. Let's tackle this as a team.
6192355000167828 Why not? Let's do it together. Just like the good old days.
6192355000167829 …You're oddly enthusiastic about this. I was only joking.
6192355000167830 Go into the steppe after midnight. Follow the railroad tracks… The long ones that unfurl to the outside world. A real line, not your metaphors.\nYou'll find me waitin'.
6192355000167831 I'll figure it out.
6192355000167832 I understand all kinds of lines. I'll find you.
6192355000167833 Those aren't metaphors.
6192355000167834 You finally came. I'm freezin' my ass off, here.
6192355000167835 What's with the fire? For a second, I thought you'd started without me.
6192355000167837 A fire… A signal fire, Cub. Used to summon.
6192355000167838 I would've found you without it.
6192355000167839 What makes you think it's for you? It's not.
6192355000167840 …Are you pranking me?
6192355000167841 Summon who? Bos Turokh?
6192355000167842 No, Cub. Bos Turokh is just a steppe folktale. Me, I'm simple. An ordinary man. And my goals, unlike yours, are ordinary too.
6192355000167843 What are you talking about? Is this some kind of prank, asshole?
6192355000167844 Use your head, artilleryman. Of course we're not blowing anything up! This railroad is my bread and butter. My veins! Hell, my carotid arteries!\nBlowing things up… It doesn't matter. The inquisitor will come. They'll instill order. Fix you terrorists.
6192355000167845 Are you stupid, Grief? You'll be the first person they hang!
6192355000167846 Well, I doubt you're trying to summon the inquisitor.
6192355000167847 Are you <i>sure</i> you're okay? Let me check your fever.
6192355000167848 All right. Did you bring the dynamite?
6192355000167849 Tell me, Cub: Have you completely lost it? What dynamite? What even makes you think I have some? Do you think I'm General Ashes? I'm a knife man. I never really told you I even <i>had</i> dynamite!
6192355000167850 So are we… not blowing anything up?
6192355000168751 …They're a smart bunch, or so I've heard. Explains the unique status. An' smart folk tend to stick together. Help each other climb the ladder, even…\nIt's you who should worry about gettin' hanged, idiot. Dynamite…
6192355000168752 My fault for trying to work together with you.
6192355000168753 All right. Forget it. Let's just watch the fire.
6192355000171751 Knife
6192355000171752 Too rough for medical procedures. Too dirty for cutlery. Only good for taking lives.
6192355000171753 Murder is a sin worse than digging wells in our town. Not because the soul is considered sacred, but because the body is. What is not whole, is not holy. A torn body is a foul mockery of the universe.
6192355000175557 [a conversation about how the fight could have gone better, and about innovative wound-dressing]
6192355000175558 [let's talk]
6192355000175559 [not interested]
6192355000179256 That you were, pal, that you were. Tired? Or do you need a bite? A drink? I can share. But you'll have to pay for the water. Not too much around.
6192355000179257 I could use some bread.
6192355000179258 I need water. My skin's starting to crack.
6192355000179259 You're right… I need sleep.
6192355000179260 "Here"? Where is… here?
6192355000182465 No need… I've been there, already.
6192355000183651 But the earth doesn't.
6192355000183654 Do you think they still remember you? It's been six years, after all.
6192355000183655 Well… maybe not all of them. But someone has to, right?
6192355000183656 They do.
6192355000183657 One of them's definitely forgotten.
6192355000193278 Burakh.
6192355000193280 Do you believe them? Before you answer, Burakh: I implore you to think, truly think. Thousands of lives might depend on your answer.
6192355000193281 Yes. I believe them.
6192355000193283 …Oh yeah. The well is not why I called you today.\nYou see, these esteemed people here are trying to convince me the odonghs are… well, immune to our infection. They supposedly do not get the sand plague.
6192355000193284 What does that have to do with you?
6192355000193285 They should've come to me with that instead.
6192355000193286 Well, if they don't, lucky them.
6192355000193287 You see, I supervise certain things at the Bull Enterprise. I am, after all, an Olgimsky. \nA large number of our workers are odonghs. Almost everyone who works with the livestock is an odongh. It's hard, dirty work. And if what they're saying is true…
6192355000193288 …Then you can resume production.
6192355000193289 …Then they can be tasked with certain unpleasant work.
6192355000193290 …Then in the end, they'll be the only survivors in the entire Town.
6192355000193291 Not quite, Burakh. Not quite. I'm racking my brain over a different concern… Don't ask me what it is. \nJust look at them and tell me: Are they lying? Or could it be true? After all, you—your father was a steppe man.
6192355000193292 I think I do need the details, though. What's troubling you?
6192355000193295 All right. I'll look at them.
6192355000193296 And how am I going to be able to tell? With a medical exam? You're joking. The Bachelor's your man for this one.
6192355000193297 Now let's make this clear, Burakh. I like you, and we have interests in common. But I will not discuss the Factory with you. I will not discuss the inner workings of our business. \nOur workers are our capital. It's our family enterprise.
6192355000193298 As you wish, then.
6192355000193299 I already have. They're not like us… But that doesn't mean anything.
6192355000193300 Yes, what they're saying makes sense. I've never seen a sick odongh.
6192355000193301 Let's take a look at those odonghs of yours, then.
6192355000193302 A medical exam would be pointless. I'll ask them and see if they're telling the truth.
6192355000193303 No. I don't believe them.
6192355000193304 They believe what they say. If it's true, though…
6192355000193305 What they say is interesting. They're chimeras. They truly are a blend of two kinds of matter. And there's a truth in that. But I have to think it over.
6192355000193306 Don't believe them. They're just like us.
6192355000193307 I do believe they actually don't get sick. They're chimeras, not humans.
6192355000193308 Why the long face? What happened?
6192355000193309 Well… I think I figured something out. About the cure.
6192355000198151 I just don't see too many reasons to celebrate, to be honest.
6192355000198152 Will you tell me?
6192355000198153 I know what kind of organic sample we need. But I've got no idea where to find it.
6192355000198154 No.
6192355000198155 C'mon, keep talking! Do I need to pry every single word out of you?
6192355000198156 So, bulls have antibodies, right? Cells that destroy the disease. And people can carry the microbe itself in their blood, but they can't weaken it. Do you understand? I can't get the two together. But I need to.
6192355000198157 <i>C'mon</i> me once again and I'll make you clean floors. Got it?
6192355000198164 So what? Can't you mix them?
6192355000198165 I need some sort of… minotaur. But they don't exist.
6192355000198166 No, I can't just mix the two samples. They're too different. Long story.
6192355000198167 So what's your plan now?
6192355000198168 I'll look for a creature that combines the traits of both man and bull.
6192355000198169 The world, you know… It's more alive than it looks. Some things seem inanimate, but when you peer closer…
6192355000198170 Not sure. Not yet.
6192355000198171 So, how's it going?
6192355000198172 Badly.
6192355000198173 Well, I never expected to succeed right away.
6192355000198174 But you can make… um, that stuff that cures the disease. Antibiotics. You said that yourself.
6192355000198175 The best our antibiotics can do is stall the disease.
6192355000198351 See? You're a man of fate, Burakh. What are you trying to prove? You can't change fate. Have you heard the story of Oedipus?
6192355000198352 Yes. I've read about him.
6192355000198353 My name was Jacob Sterkh. Worked in shipping. Two marriages, both happy. Brought up a daughter. \nFriends woke me up in the night; they were getting a posse together to catch old Kain's killer. We ambushed him at the Station. That's where I was killed; with my own knife, no less.
6192355000202693 Burakh. The situation is regretful. I just didn't have time to warn you.
6192355000202694 This was ugly of you.
6192355000202695 I understand. Forget it.
6192355000202696 You shouldn't have started the meeting without me.
6192355000202697 Well, let's get down to business. We have three doctors in town. Four, if we count the deranged girl who claims to have a healing touch—rubbish, of course. But she has a lot of energy, and she knows a thing or two, so it won't hurt to let her work. \nAnd Burakh, allow me to be frank?
6192355000202698 Shoot.
6192355000202699 We're wasting time.
6192355000202700 …Wait a second, you mean the girl in the wool cap, with needles for eyes?
6192355000202701 Where did you graduate? What are your qualifications? Do you have a degree?
6192355000202702 I don't have a degree.
6192355000202703 I'm a surgeon. And a damn good one.
6192355000202704 Medical school.
6192355000202705 Burakh, I want you to become my aide. Our primary goal is developing a vaccine. You're a local, and… enterprising. I need your help.
6192355000202706 Vaccines aren't my area of expertise.
6192355000202707 A vaccine? We wouldn't finish that until after the whole town is extinct. But what an amazing breakthrough for your resume, right?
6192355000202708 A vaccine is something you create for the future, not for people who are sick now! You just want to protect your buddies in the Capital if the plague spreads, huh?
6192355000202709 Other towns like this one exist, you know. \nIf this disease is half as lethal as the outbreak five years ago, this place is doomed. Other people can still be saved. Or perhaps you have better suggestions?
6192355000202710 I'll think of something. I won't let you just give up on the sick.
6192355000202711 How can you know that? You weren't here five years ago. You weren't here five days ago!
6192355000202712 Just say it. What do you want from me?
6192355000202713 I will make the vaccine, but I can't do it without you. All you need to do is be at hand and do as I say. I will take full responsibility for the situation.
6192355000202714 Perhaps I'll drop by… if I have the time.
6192355000202715 No deal. I am responsible for my actions, no one else. Family tradition.
6192355000202716 So what do you have in mind, Burakh?
6192355000202717 I need to find a way to… save people.
6192355000202719 Neither were you. But I've been collecting evidence—since yesterday, when you were dashing around the steppe. My explorations have actually been successful. \nAnd mind your tone, Burakh. I don't take kindly to rudeness.
6192355000202720 Familiarity breeds affection. I'm sure you'll grow to appreciate it.
6192355000202721 Yes, I wasn't here for the First Outbreak. But this is my hometown.
6192355000202722 They are mine. Our goal is to stall the epidemic… and prevent a worldwide pandemic.
6192355000202723 My goal is survival. We're each on our own, emshen.
6192355000202724 A worldwide… huh. You're pretty honest about your ambitions, aren't you?
6192355000202725 That's your goal. Mine is to protect my hometown.
6192355000202726 Yes… I guess she wears a cap. And she does have… a presence. You've met?
6192355000202727 We have… but it doesn't matter.
6192355000202728 Don't ever let her close to you! We… we don't need her.
6192355000202729 Forget her. What did you want to talk about?
6192355000202733 Think about it. A curative serum for an unknown disease? This contagious, and this lethal? On such short notice? What a utopian thought. \nA vaccine, on the other hand, can protect the healthy—the people who still have a chance.
6192355000202734 I'd rather take care of those who are already suffering.
6192355000202735 Go to hell, emshen.
6192355000202736 And you're calling me ambitious? If this is the same disease that broke out here five years ago, then plague is like mumps compared to it!
6192355000202737 So what?
6192355000202738 We don't know what really happened during that outbreak!
6192355000205551 
6192355000205552 
6192355000206351 Chief Notkin's pack nest in this warehouse. Kids here trade for food and sharp objects.
6192355000206352 The Soul-and-a-Half Fortress
6192355000206353 
6192355000206354 Var the Scar-Faced buys organs.
6192355000206355 Lara Ravel's mansion. We used to call her Gravel, because she always had an edge on us. I can always have a nap here.
6192355000206356 The Shelter
6192355000206357 My father's house. My house. Locked.
6192355000206358 Bad Grief's Nest
6192355000206359 Grigory Filin, also known as Bad Grief, reigns over a small warehouse kingdom these days.
6192355000206360 The local authorities often visit the place. But the town jail is in the same building.
6192355000206361 The Lump
6192355000206362 The Olgimskys' mansion. Fat Vlad is the owner of the Bull Enterprise, but many just call him "the Master."
6192355000212152 You believe taking your father's vessel was enough to become him? You jest, emshen. You cannot heal. You know not the Lines. \nDon't take too much on, or you'll snap like a rotten bough…
6192355000212153 Well, we'll see now if I can heal or not.
6192355000212154 I don't need your concern. I can take care of myself.
6192355000212155 Fine. I won't.
6192355000212156 Isidor's notes remain at my place. You're in no hurry to take them, are you? I've heard a thing or two about the Lines, I can replicate the Art. What about you, he-who-casts-off-his-own-legacy? Can you?
6192355000212157 They're at your place? Very well. Let's pay it a visit, and there I'll take my legacy.
6192355000212158 Whatever. Do as you will.
6192355000212159 I'll try.
6192355000212160 He will die, emshen. You will take his fate into your hands, and he will die. Stain not your hands with the death of a person who trusts you.
6192355000212161 How do you know he will die?
6192355000212162 You're not a doctor, khetey. I am.
6192355000212163 Who the hell are you?
6192355000212164 You are not a healer yet. You will fail. You're a big man, but not so big as to take on responsibility for others…\nBut someone must try it. This is where you are right. We can't simply let it happen without a fight… So let me fight.
6192355000212165 Then let this be a learning experience for me. Move aside, khetey. I won't hide behind your back.
6192355000212166 Perhaps I'm not so big. But I'm definitely big enough to take responsibility for myself.
6192355000212167 All right. Go on. I'll keep an eye on your progress.
6192355000212168 I am Sahba Usp'tae. The townsfolk call me Aspity. I am respected, for I can speak on behalf of Earth. I interpret her will. And now I speak to you on behalf of your father.
6192355000212169 Did you know him well?
6192355000212170 Presumptuous…
6192355000212171 I loved him. He made me. I owe him a debt of gratitude.
6192355000212172 But you're not a doctor. How do you know the boy will die?
6192355000212173 Say what you must, and move aside. They're waiting for me.
6192355000219951 I don't know yet.
6192355000219955 Yeah… I could use a cure for the blues now.
6192355000219958 I do. It's the thing that makes people tell the truth.
6192355000219959 No, I mean a blood serum. A cure. Serum treatment.
6192355000219960 So imagine a person gets infected, right? Their body begins fighting the sickness. Creates antibodies.
6192355000219963 D'you live under a rock or something? An alarm rang across the whole Town. Only you and deaf folks haven't heard about the Sand Plague yet…\nA cure needs to be made. A… what's the word? A panacea?
6192355000219964 I know all that.
6192355000219965 A panacea? Fairy tales will do you no good.
6192355000219966 I think you should aim right for the philosopher's stone, kid. Piece of cake.
6192355000219971 I've come… I've come to help. There must be something I can do, right?
6192355000219972 At times like these, reasonable folks stay at home. You should too, Lara.
6192355000219973 I'm sure there's something you can do.
6192355000219975 Well, Stakh's desperate for us to keep busy. Who else could provide cold compresses to the sick?
6192355000219976 …Okay. I'll find a way to help on my own. And you? What are you up to?
6192355000219977 Me? It's a tough one, I suppose. I'm going to make a cure for the sand pest.
6192355000219980 A cure? In these conditions? Don't you need… I don't know, special instruments? An army of chemists? The best we have is a kitchen stove.\nHow do you hope to succeed?
6192355000219981 Are you familiar with how blood serums work?
6192355000219982 Hey, Pasteur and Koch worked in barns. Never stopped them.
6192355000219983 No, I don't. Wait… No, I definitely don't.
6192355000219984 We take blood rich with antibodies, purify it, and inject the patient with the resulting serum.
6192355000219985 We can enhance the antibodies of someone already ill with certain herbs—for example, twyre.
6192355000219986 It won't be perfect. Side effects are almost guaranteed, but it should save the patient. All we need to do is find the right donor.
6192355000219987 And where will you find a suitable donor? Sand pest kills anyone, everyone, and it kills quick. Not a soul survived the outbreak five years past.
6192355000219988 I'll find someone. The blood of sick townsfolk will be a good start.
6192355000219989 I never said it was a person. Such a serum could be made from animals.
6192355000219990 Sick people have antibodies. Maybe only a little, and in certain areas of the body, but they can be found.
6192355000219991 This hunt for blood sounds dangerous, Cub. Won't you just infect yourself? Promise me you'll be as careful as you can. If you need me, please ask.
6192355000219992 I'm not making any promises.
6192355000219993 I promise.
6192355000219994 Thank you, Lara. You're the only one who believes in me.
6192355000223951 It's hard to admit, but I think arrogance is my undoing. This damn microbe is a shapeshifter, a proteus. It eludes me. The vaccine doesn't work. Burakh, this is a dead end.
6192355000223952 It is a dead end, erdem. I've tried all the obvious components, but none of them work.
6192355000223953 I have extracted a microbial culture. I weakened it—it's doable even without all the tools I'm used to.\nBut it's ever-changing! Like a person first sick with pox, then with cholera, then with typhoid fever! What do I do?
6192355000223954 Hm… A sickness like this needs unique antibodies. What kind of creature could produce them?
6192355000223967 This cure… It needs some sort of special tissue. It needs to be more than human…
6192355000223968 There are more kinds of life in the world than it seems at first glance… Could this be the answer?
6192355000223969 And yet, there is a wholeness to this disease. There must be some commonality between all those heinous shapes. What do they share? If I understand that, I could catch it by the tail! The answer must be so close…
6192355000223970 But who says that this creature is beyond reach? Human or not… Who cares.
6192355000223971 It's not even about immunity. The tissue must fight back, not defend… <i>overcome</i> the enemy, not just protect itself!
6192355000223972 The scientific method has never failed me. I've always walked the path it showed me. But science is… a minx. You need to keep her fascinated, to change yourself, invent new things. I need to think outside the box…
6192355000223973 The scientific method… no. Hand-me-down answers won't help me here.
6192355000223974 Searching for answers in one's specialty… in the fields one has unique access to… Hmm…
6192355000223975 When something fights back… that's not a rejection, that's something else. Yes… the answer must be close…
6192355000223976 Thinking outside the box… Yes! That's the approach this problem needs!
6192355000223977 …Which means that I need to approach the problem from a very unusual angle. But it's challenging. The fuller one's memory, the more active the brain, the more limits it imposes upon itself.
6192355000223978 Correct. When you're at a dead end, perhaps what you need is to rise upwards.
6192355000223979 Yes. When it seems like a dead end, that might be an illusion. Just walk through walls.
6192355000223980 Accepting that one is lost… That's a breakthrough all on its own.
6192355000231951 Meaning we just increase the dose, right? Then they'll be cured.
6192355000231952 It's lucky for those infected that I'm in charge instead of you.
6192355000231953 If you increase the dose, the patient will simply die.
6192355000231954 No. We need a serum that can cure the plague once and for all.
6192355000231955 So how do we make a panacea, then?
6192355000231956 We need a different organic tissue… of some kind.
6192355000231957 We need a creature that can withstand this disease. And I don't think it will be human.
6192355000232036 Why should I love you? I don't need to love you at all. I can stop loving you whenever I want.
6192355000232037 What are you doing here, little one?
6192355000232038 I see.
6192355000232039 Did you see an energetic boy with freckles come out of here?
6192355000232040 I didn't. No boy. Nobody came out.
6192355000232041 You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.
6192355000232042 …
6192355000232043 What's wrong? Tell me.
6192355000232044 So why'd you come here, anyway?
6192355000232045 Do you want me to take you home? Where do you live?
6192355000232046 Let's go catch some roosters. I'll show you something.
6192355000232047 Roosters?
6192355000232048 I can't. I'm busy.
6192355000232049 I live in a train car all by myself. And you know, I have a real colorful… thing, I forgot what it's called. I hung it on the opposite wall.
6192355000232050 Not the best place for a little girl to live.
6192355000234551 All quiet for now. I have time to gather my thoughts before I get back to business.
6192355000237251 A train car? It must be cold in there.
6192355000237252 All by yourself? That's not good.
6192355000237253 It's a kind of grass with a little comb on top. I know every kind of grass. They show themselves to me. I know them even better than those dancing-prancing girls.
6192355000237254 Well… That's remarkable.
6192355000237255 Let's go.
6192355000237256 We're not going now. Let's go at night. Come to my train car and use our secret knock. Like this: knock-knock, knock, knock-knock.
6192355000237257 You know what, kid? You're gonna leave that train car. Come live with me.
6192355000237258 Deal. I'll try to remember.
6192355000237259 I don't want to live with you. Why should I live with you? I might come for a visit. Maybe live with you for a tiny bit, later, if you have some food.
6192355000237260 I'll find something.
6192355000237261 Food is… Never mind, I'll get something.
6192355000237651 How fares your kine, Khatangher?
6192355000237652 Do you know what an udurgh is? What does the Khandro sigil stand for?
6192355000237653 Poorly.
6192355000237654 A body that contains a world. Everyone knows that.
6192355000237655 But what does that… mean?
6192355000237656 Everyone but me…
6192355000237657 Be khara, it can be a creature made of many creatures. Like a family. A tagloor—a group of people bound by the same fate.
6192355000237658 You haven't made it more clear.
6192355000237659 I see.
6192355000237660 Our words are erased, Khatangher. We turn our fathers' flutes into sticks. We take old words, big words, and apply them to small things. But the connection to the source is still there. The Lines remember.
6192355000237661 Yes… Connections are like veins. You can't just tear them out.
6192355000237662 Khaya dee. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.
6192355000247451 Father is dead. Should I still insist on rushing home…?
6192355000247452 I let the traitor go. Not sure if Notkin would want to know or not.
6192355000247453 In a warehouse that belongs to kids, something's brewing.
6192355000247454 Well, I cut out the parts he didn't need. Let's see what Bad Grief thinks of that.
6192355000254351 Be khara, you are a true heir to Isidor. You show it with alacrity, with your deeds. You know the ties that bind the world.
6192355000254352 I just try to follow the Lines.
6192355000254353 Drop it, khetey. I will never compare to him. He was a true weaver.
6192355000254354 He cannot be replaced, but someone has to do his job. So here I am.
6192355000254355 Blame not yourself. "A physician is entitled to some mistakes," as your father used to say. He erred, too. What matters is that you tried. You had the courage to try. You took upon yourself his role.
6192355000254356 I did.
6192355000254357 A physician isn't entitled to that.
6192355000254358 Did Father make mistakes, though? I remember no such thing.
6192355000254359 This is your father's udhar, his "warm vessel." Inside is your inheritance. Open it.
6192355000254360 It's heavy…
6192355000254361 Bayarlaa, Sahba. I gratefully accept.
6192355000254362 Any new thoughts on the contents of the udhar?
6192355000254363 No.
6192355000254364 The murderer still breathes. That's what's bothering me.
6192355000254365 I'll think about them.
6192355000254851 What have you got in your pockets?
6192355000254852 Tools. Forget it. Here's what I want to know: What business did you have with my father? Old Burakh?
6192355000254854 Well… we actually went to his place often. He used to teach us things. Why do you ask?
6192355000254856 So you used to go to his place together? All of you? Everyone on this list here?
6192355000254857 Sometimes we'd all go together, sometimes in twos or threes… sometimes alone. A lot of things happen. Why are you asking? It's not like we bothered him; he invited us.
6192355000254858 What did he want from you?
6192355000254859 Maybe one of you knows how he died, then? Maybe you?
6192355000254860 So you were his friends. Did he have enemies?
6192355000254861 No, I don't think he would…
6192355000254862 Think again.
6192355000254863 Kid, you're clearly hiding something. But it's very important for me to know. Do you understand?
6192355000254864 You know what? Ask Capella. She's the oldest of us all, and the best explainer. She's a good person, too.
6192355000254865 Capella? Who's that?
6192355000254866 Olgimsky's daughter, huh? Why her?
6192355000254867 She is like… a big sister to us all. She put together a union.
6192355000254868 A… union? What union?
6192355000254869 All right. I'll ask her.
6192355000254870 Don't worry about it. Just a union. Of people under fifteen. Anyway, ask her. She might be mad at me if I say too much.
6192355000254871 Okay.
6192355000254872 Good. Tight lips are a good skill to have.
6192355000254873 Fat Vlad's daughter. But she's not like him at all. She even lives in a separate wing of the house.
6192355000254874 Is it a good thing or a bad thing that they're different?
6192355000254875 Good.
6192355000254876 What carry you in all those pockets, Burakh?
6192355000254877 Tools. Never mind them… Here's what I'd like to know: What business did you have with my father? With Old Burakh?
6192355000254879 We… went to his place often. He used to teach us things. Why do you ask?
6192355000254881 So you used to go to his home together? All of you? Take a look at this list…
6192355000254882 Sometimes we would all go together, other times in twos or threes… or alone. Many things happened. Why do you ask, though? It's not like we imposed on him; he invited us.
6192355000254883 What did he want from you?
6192355000254884 Maybe one of you knows how he died, then? You, perhaps?
6192355000254885 So you were his friends. Did he have enemies?
6192355000254886 No.
6192355000254887 Think a little harder.
6192355000254888 Kid, you're holding something back. But this is <i>very</i> important to me. Do I make myself clear?
6192355000254889 You know what? Ask Capella. She's the oldest of us all, and the best explainer. She's a good person, too.
6192355000254890 Who's this Capella?
6192355000254891 Olgimsky's daughter, huh? Why her?
6192355000254892 She is like… a big sister to us all. She put together a union.
6192355000254893 A… union? What union?
6192355000254894 …Very well, I'll go talk to her.
6192355000254895 Don't worry about it. Just a union. Of people under fifteen. Anyway, ask her. She might be mad at me if I say too much.
6192355000254896 Okay.
6192355000254897 Good. Tight lips are a good skill to have.
6192355000254898 Fat Vlad's daughter. But she's not like him at all. She even lives in a separate wing of the house.
6192355000254899 Is it a good thing or a bad thing that they're different?
6192355000254900 Good. Don't hold her family against her.
6192355000254901 What's that you're carrying?
6192355000254902 Tools. Forget it. But tell me: What business did you have with my father? Old Burakh?
6192355000254904 Well… we actually went to his place a lot. He used to teach us things. Why?
6192355000254906 So you used to go to his place together? All of you? Look at this list of names.
6192355000254907 Sometimes we'd all go together. Sometimes just two or three… or alone. A lot of stuff happened. Why do you care, though? It's not like we were bothering him. He invited us!
6192355000254908 What did he want from you?
6192355000254909 Maybe one of you know how he died, then? What about you, huh?
6192355000254910 So you were his friends. Did he have enemies?
6192355000254911 Nope.
6192355000254912 Think, okay?
6192355000254913 Kid, you're obviously hiding something. But this is very important to me. Do you understand?
6192355000254914 You know what? Ask Capella. She's the oldest of all of us and she's the best at explaining things. And a good person, too.
6192355000254915 Capella? Who's that?
6192355000254916 Olgimsky's daughter, huh… Why her?
6192355000254917 She's like… a big sister to us all. She created the union.
6192355000254918 A… union? What union?
6192355000254919 …Very well, I'll go talk to her.
6192355000254923 Fat Vlad's daughter. But she's not like him at all. She even lives in a separate wing of the house.
6192355000254924 Is it a good thing or a bad thing that they're different?
6192355000254925 Good.
6192355000258351 I'll use this scalpel you just had lying around, then.
6192355000258352 Huh… You really do know how it works.
6192355000261451 Capella
6192355000261452 Eva Yan
6192355000267051 Scout
6192355000269851 текст: Я отпустил предателя. Уж не знаю, захочет ли атаман Ноткин о том слышать.
6192355000269852 Ну что ж, лишнее я вырезал. Поглядим, что Гриф об этом скажет.
6192355000270051 Who's Notkin?
6192355000270052 The leader of the Soul-and-a-Halves. Everyone knows us. Our headquarters is in the Warehouses.
6192355000270053 I see… We used to have our own hideout over there when we were kids, too.
6192355000270054 I seek them all, all those on your list. Joyfully: I might take them one by one, I might take them all at once. Shall I follow your whim? Shall I kill them one by one?
6192355000270055 Why? Why are they on this list?
6192355000270056 One by one would be better.
6192355000270057 You have me there, warrior. I relish that you are fearless enough to offer straight answers. One by one it is, then.
6192355000270058 Let the boy go. What use is he to you?
6192355000270059 I'll find a way to beat you. Just you wait. I'm not afraid.
6192355000270060 Your father was wiser than you. Mightier. He knew we did not quarrel over mere menfolk's lives. The goal is the Eighth. The kids matter only as long as they are of use to the Eighth.
6192355000270061 Who is the Eighth?
6192355000270062 Useful how?
6192355000270065 Guess! Time yet remains for you.
6192355000270066 You want to play at riddles? I'd rather be the one asking. Want a tough one?
6192355000270067 So, all the people on the list are useful somehow?
6192355000270068 Who slew your father, Burakh?
6192355000270069 I don't know.
6192355000270070 You?
6192355000270071 I'll figure it out soon.
6192355000270072 You are a fool, Burakh. You know nothing. Understand nothing. Call yourself a healer? Don't kid yourself. Who will you heal? From what? Shall you seize an ill babe and cram them full of your "antibiotics"?\nYou're an unbearable bore, no fun at all.
6192355000270073 Likewise. You're not here to be played with. You deserve to be hunted down and destroyed.
6192355000270074 Indeed, surprise me.
6192355000270075 It walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening. What is it?
6192355000270076 Thieves came to steal the homeowners, but the house itself escapes through the windows.
6192355000270077 How do I kill you?
6192355000270080 At least I know the list of your future victims.
6192355000270081 Moreso the Eighth.
6192355000270082 I'll figure it out. I'll ask around.
6192355000270083 At least I understand it's not human.
6192355000270651 But what's my fate?
6192355000270652 Fate is not to be fought, beakhead. It must be overcome another way.
6192355000270653 I told you already, Burakh. It's not pretty. You will spill blood. Just let it go, Ripper. Don't be so bull-headed. Just because you have a hammer doesn't mean every problem's a nail.
6192355000270654 Nothing wrong with my head. My brain's functioning just fine.
6192355000270655 If I have a hammer, then you might be in trouble, beakhead.
6192355000270656 What Kain? …Who did you expect to find there?
6192355000270657 Kain? Don't you mean Burakh?
6192355000270658 I was called Kirik. It was my idea to catch the murderer at the Station. So we lay in ambush. The train came. A man got off. "Get him, boys!" I cried. \nThat was stupid of me. The killer would be getting on, not off…
6192355000270659 Take it as a lesson, fool. This world is not for the likes of you.
6192355000270660 I'm sorry.
6192355000270661 It's for the best, Kirik. All of this is for the best…
6192355000270662 They called me Bertie. Short for "Bertrand." And that's one of the kinder nicknames… "Bertie" was fine. A name's just a name. \nI got murdered at the Station last night. Didn't rightly know what I was doing there. Figure I just went along with the herd.
6192355000270663 That's enough tear-jerking.
6192355000270664 With a name like that, it must've been a tough life. It'll be better now.
6192355000270665 I'm sorry, Bertrand.
6192355000270672 Did you enjoy your little chats? They don't blame you, as you saw. I suppose they haven't quite come to terms with their fates yet. Or perhaps they have. Death does that to people.
6192355000270673 If I could only fix it…
6192355000270674 Serves them right. I won't cry over them.
6192355000270675 I'll tell you a story.\nOnce there was a man who wanted to fix everything. He begged on bended knee for a chance to turn back time… And when he got it, history repeated itself. "Good job," we told him. "That's your fate." He asked us, "Once more?"
6192355000270676 So?
6192355000270677 So we let him try once more, but with a catch. He who denies his fate will be punished. He'll keep living as a cripple. Lame. Wounded. See where I'm going with this?
6192355000270678 Did he try again, then?
6192355000270679 I do. Shall we try?
6192355000270680 I don't remember and I don't care. Even if he didn't, there probably wasn't a happy ending. You can't fight fate, Burakh. It's immutable.
6192355000270681 I'll still try.
6192355000270682 He was permanently crippled? I wonder how…?
6192355000270683 I'm not a ripper.
6192355000270684 I'm finished, Doc. Don't come near me. We both know how it is. No escape. No face mask will save you. Don't come by again.
6192355000270685 Hush, now. And don't you dare give up! I'll find a cure!
6192355000270686 How long has it been?
6192355000270687 Not so long. My bones feel like they've been burning for about an hour.
6192355000270688 Does it hurt?
6192355000270689 Don't give up, you hear me? There has to be a way!
6192355000270690 Tell them to carry me away from here! Away from my friends. And our Halves, the fools won't let me go. \nLet them quarantine me! Let them take me away! Otherwise everyone will die! Please, Doc!
6192355000270691 We'll carry you wherever you want. We will. Please, calm down.
6192355000270692 We'll find a way to cure you, boy. Let me give you some medicine…
6192355000271151 I'm sorry.
6192355000271152 Did you catch it from your friend? What's his name… Patches?
6192355000271153 I suppose. I don't know.
6192355000271154 You need to get to the hospital.
6192355000271155 Just don't be afraid. Listen, it's not over yet!
6192355000274051 Patrolman
6192355000276251 Live without looking forward, emshen.
6192355000276252 Khetey, tell me about this word: "udurgh." That's the sigil from the list—the one from my inheritance. What do you know of it?
6192355000276253 I'm trying.
6192355000276254 It is… a creature made up of many other living beings. "A body that contains the world."
6192355000276255 Such as…?
6192355000276256 So, it could be a human being. Millions of things live inside each one of us.
6192355000276257 Perhaps, emshen. I know not such things, I lack your city knowledge. Many living beings inhabit us, like people inhabit Bos Turokh. That, I believe.
6192355000276258 Bos Turokh, the forefather of bulls?
6192355000276259 So, it <i>is</i> a person.
6192355000276260 Bos Turokh, the great bull of elder stories. He is Earth. We follow the Lines when we cut up bulls because in his lines, in his nerves and sinews, Bos Turokh encased the knowledge of how the world is connected.\nWhen opening up a body, a butcher reenacts Creation.
6192355000276261 Bos Turokh created the world. I remember that story.
6192355000276262 Even Worms no longer believe we live on a huge bull.
6192355000276263 Sure, it's metaphor. But a beautiful, clever metaphor. Think of the world as though it is a living thing. Understand that all things are tied to all other things, just like a body. Respect it like a creature with its own free will.
6192355000276264 So you think the "udurgh" is Bos Turokh?
6192355000276265 My father listed a giant bull of legend among his patients? That's absurd.
6192355000276266 Perhaps. Think about it. Your father chose the sigil because your written language lacks a suitable name for such a creature. A body that contains the world. Something living that consists of many parts.
6192355000276267 That doesn't help me at all.
6192355000276268 "A body that contains the world." Could be anything, really.
6192355000276269 That's what the Kin might have called, say, a train. A train, made of many cars. The description fits, you know.
6192355000276270 They might. But unlike illiterate Worms, your father knew the word for "train" well. And I doubt he thought of trains as living things in need of salvation.
6192355000276271 Fair enough.
6192355000276272 Bayarlaa, Sahba. This was an enlightening conversation.
6192355000276273 Yes?
6192355000276274 Stakh, take a look at this sigil. It's called "udurgh." Ever heard of that?
6192355000276275 Nothing. Just passing through.
6192355000276276 More Kin nonsense? They mark bulls with this. What does it matter? I have no interest in their stupid cattle brands.
6192355000276277 So no love for our kind. Why?
6192355000276278 You've never come across the word? "Udurgh." Think for a moment… Maybe my father mentioned it?
6192355000276279 Your father wasted too much effort on that rabble.
6192355000276280 Big words.
6192355000276281 My father and I, we're also of the steppe. Did you somehow forget?
6192355000276282 They distracted him from his work. Wanted him to live for them, toil for them, tend to them!\nAll they need is an owner. A protector. A caretaker. Someone to cling to, like fleas, draining their blood. They're all about blood.
6192355000276283 Someone has a temper. Is this personal?
6192355000276284 Wolves! Wolves, each and every one of them! They surround you, smother you, they wait till you're out of breath, then they press on, and on, and on.\nThey put him into an early grave, the blasted Kin, and I'm soon to follow.
6192355000276285 What, you? What reason could they possibly have?
6192355000276286 "They," huh? Not "you"? So you think I'm a different breed?
6192355000276287 You sound jealous. Or maybe…?
6192355000276288 Well, maybe I gave them a reason. Or maybe it's habit for them by now.\nLook. Take your damn sigil and get lost. You picked a curious time to study folklore. You need work, or what? Let me know, and I'll make you busy.
6192355000276289 I'm working right now, Stakh. Figuring this out is my job, too.
6192355000276291 Folklore… There's an idea. Doesn't Olgimsky's son record steppe folklore?
6192355000276292 You need more sleep, friend.
6192355000276293 Might be the Kin, might not.
6192355000276294 Glad to see you, Burakh.
6192355000276295 You mentioned that you study steppe rites. Does the word "udurgh" mean anything to you?
6192355000276297 They believe a bull's body mirrors the structure of the universe. Your "udurgh" is this sacrificial bull.
6192355000276298 Not quite what I expected…
6192355000276299 Can a person be called that?
6192355000276300 Well, it's complicated. I can't help with the finer points. I know a man well versed in such things: Foreman Oyun. But there's a… predicament.
6192355000276301 A predicament?
6192355000276302 Oyun… I know the name. He was Father's friend. So he could help me?
6192355000276303 The Foreman of the Abattoir. A resourceful and reliable man—irreplaceable, even. He's a link. He helps us keep the Kin under control.
6192355000276304 I know all that. So where is he?
6192355000276306 I need to see him.
6192355000276307 I assume he's locked in the Termitary with the rest of the Kin. Which means he is well out of your reach. You'll have to wait until this blasted epidemic is over. \nI hope you're doing everything you can to end it.
6192355000276308 Why was the Termitary locked?
6192355000276310 Your father told me that the Termitary was closed on his orders. But he refused to explain his reasons.
6192355000276311 Fine, Burakh, since it's you who's asking.\nThe Termitary was closed because of a massive upcoming strike. And since our workforce is rather… special, it would have inevitably become a bloody, bestial riot. Do you follow me?
6192355000276312 Yes. A preventative measure?
6192355000276313 Go on.
6192355000276316 It was a stroke of luck that it happened right before the epidemic. The strict blockade of the Termitary became a quarantine. Now we can be sure that thirty percent of the whole Town is quite safe.
6192355000276317 Thirty percent? Did I hear you right?
6192355000276319 They are a wild people. They are restless. You know how prone they are to bouts of collective hysteria. It's like a dancing fever… or a laughing sickness. Like a flock of birds, if you will. \nIt's unfortunate the Termitary is packed so tight. Exacerbates the issue.
6192355000276320 Meaning?
6192355000276321 A fresh census is long overdue, but as far as I know, the Termitary shelters about five thousand people. Yes, the conditions are hard to bear. Crowding, poverty. But don't blame our family for that.
6192355000276322 I need to get in. Immediately.
6192355000276323 There's also a girl, Taya… Tycheek's daughter. I need to make sure she's all right.
6192355000276324 I need Oyun.
6192355000276325 You bewilder me, Burakh. You're a doctor, aren't you? You of all people should understand such things.\nRight now, the Termitary is an ark. A bastion of safety. Despite the riots, despite the crowds and the possible hunger. There is water, at least.\nCan you guarantee you won't carry the plague in on your boots?
6192355000276326 No… No, I can't.
6192355000276327 We have to think of something…
6192355000276328 You have no idea what you're talking about, Burakh. What did they tell you about the Termitary? That it's a prison?\nI built that behemoth of a bunkhouse after the wooden town burnt down. They're crammed together in there? Well, they weren't before! It's tight because… they're <i>breeding!</i> Do people breed when their conditions are poor? No… they die out! They'd have more space if they did, but they don't! Am I making my point clear?
6192355000276329 It's still a prison, though.
6192355000276330 Fine, let's drop the subject.
6192355000276331 Come on, don't shout. You'll have a stroke.
6192355000276332 There are people who want to move in there.
6192355000276333 No good, no good… It's crammed full as it is. Five thousand souls are… no joke, my boy.
6192355000276334 Well, I personally want to get inside too.
6192355000276336 Five thousand in a building that size? That's a torture chamber!
6192355000276337 Mother Boddho caress your step, yargachin. Have some coin. We've collected it; there's a lot. Tell them to let us into the Warren. We're scared.
6192355000276338 The Warren? You mean the Termitary?
6192355000276339 Why do you want to get in there?
6192355000276340 Tell them to let us in. Fat Vlad will listen to you. Take the money—just tell him yourself!
6192355000276341 He won't. Go back where you came from.
6192355000276342 I talked to him already. No use.
6192355000276343 All right. Give it to me. I'll try.
6192355000276344 Keep your money.
6192355000276345 It's foul. Cramped. Suffocating. Too high, too concrete. But safe.
6192355000276346 Are you hiding from the mob? They calmed down. Relax.
6192355000276347 What are you running from? The clay demon?
6192355000276350 Why speak of it? Evil is coming, yargachin. You know it too.\nInside lives Taya, Overseer Tycheek's daughter. She can protect us from any evil. No harm will befall the place where Mother Superior lives.
6192355000277551 I don't understand what you mean.
6192355000277552 What evil?
6192355000284467 A key to the secret shelter your good father used to cure people. He ordered me to relay it to you. Respectfully, I obey. Here is the key.
6192355000284468 He ordered you? When? He's… he's dead.
6192355000284469 Some secret if he invited people in. Any random stranger could know!
6192355000284470 What makes you think he's dead? People like Old Burakh are above death. They cannot be vanished. Take the key, and see for yourself.
6192355000284471 All right.
6192355000284472 I laid him to his final rest myself. Let us not cling to false hope.
6192355000284473 Indeed… Why does everyone call it secret, then? Perhaps it was only concealed from the people he wanted to hide his work from. Such as the powers that be. And us common people, we know everything.
6192355000284474 When did Father give you the key? He died three days ago!
6192355000284475 I wonder what kind of work needs to be hidden from The Powers That Be.

6192355000290453 Governor Saburov is in the Town Hall. He's in charge of Father's case.
6192355000290454 If I don't hurry, Father will be laid to rest in the wrong way.
6192355000290455 Something incredible is happening at the Cemetery.
6192355000290456 
6192355000290457 What the hell is happening at the cemetery?
6192355000290458 Khan lives in the Polyhedron.

6192355000290460 Khan is in the Polyhedron.

6192355000290463 
6192355000290464 Taya Tycheek lives in a worker bunkhouse, the so-called Termitary.
6192355000290465 
6192355000290466 Taya Tycheek is the Termitary, a giant bunkhouse for our workers.
6192355000290467 "Udurgh" means "the body that contains a world." It refers to something that consists of many parts.
6192355000290468 
6192355000290469 "Udurgh" means "the body that contains a world." It refers to something that consists of many living parts.

6192355000302052 Ene she yuun khun gheeshebshe? You have ears like a jerboa. Did you know you can catch shingles from a jerboa? Just like that.
6192355000302053 Well, you have ears like a mouse.
6192355000302054 And not just shingles.
6192355000302055 You're Taya Tycheek.
6192355000302056 My entire family is right here. And I'll have you know it's your family, too.
6192355000302057 Are you all fine? I mean, are you healthy?
6192355000302058 Myy uymen… I hate it here. They tell me all day long that I'm the most important person, yet they won't let me out. Won't let me play. Won't bring me anything I ask for.\nAnd they keep screaming and screaming through the walls! Who would want to live in such a place?
6192355000302059 Where's your father? Overseer Tycheek?
6192355000302060 How can I know that if they won't even let me out of this room? It's so, <i>so</i> boooring!\nAt least you got here, that's <i>something</i> new. And even that is only because I'm dreaming of you. Bou khara, bou shagna…
6192355000302061 It's good that they're not letting you out. It's safer that way.
6192355000302062 How come?
6192355000302063 Because we are the Kin. We are of the same blood. Of the same root. All children of Boddho, toonto nutag, aba ezhe… something something… That's what Dad says.\nAnd you've got a scratch on your cheek!
6192355000302064 But where's your dad?
6192355000302065 She yuunde ereebshe? Why did you come, anyway? You must have some sort of request for Our Not-So-Highness. I'm listening.
6192355000302066 I just wanted to make sure you're alive.
6192355000302067 What would you like to be brought, girl?
6192355000302068 I thought it was I who dreamed of you.
6192355000302069 Do you know who, or what, an "udurgh" is?
6192355000302070 Where's Foreman Oyun? Is he here with you?
6192355000302074 Follow the road by which bulls come to us from the steppe.\nMedeneghshe, now <i>that</i> was a great place to live. I'd like it sooo much to leave these ugly walls and move there. Life would become incredible. And it's so easy…
6192355000302075 Yeah, can't imagine any complications with that.
6192355000302077 Thanks, kid.
6192355000302078 Not to go on all-Fours; that is the Law. Are we not Men?
6192355000302079 Who are you?
6192355000302080 Our Mother Superior, joy of our people, long expected you. Speak, now, to me.
6192355000302081 Why you, though? I'll talk to her.
6192355000302082 It is all the same. Mother Superior has hundreds of eyes, ears, and hands. We are all one. This tongue is her tongue. These ears are her ears. I have long waited for you, guest. Speak. I will listen.
6192355000302083 I'd rather just listen.
6192355000302084 Not to suck up Drink; that is the Law. Are you not Men?
6192355000302085 I am.
6192355000302086 I'd rather look around.
6192355000302087 Mother Superior, joy of our people, wants you to lead us away into the steppe. We want to go home. \nHave you not heard her? She likes not this place. This evil cesspit overflows with ennui and misery.
6192355000302088 Why won't you let her out of her room?
6192355000302089 I want to inspect the Termitary.
6192355000302090 Impossible. It is dangerous out there.
6192355000302091 Why?
6192355000302092 Is this because of your riot? Are you still losing your minds?
6192355000302093 This is not to be spoken of. Or there will be punishment. Such is the Law.
6192355000302094 I hear screams. That means some people are alive out there. Comforting.
6192355000302095 Yeah, yeah. "Are you not Men?"
6192355000302096 So it <i>is</i> about the riot…
6192355000302097 I, Mother Superior, joy of our people, now grant you an audience. Have you seen already how the udurgh suffers without our care? Have you leaned against his ear? Have you tasted his humors? Or have you quenched his thirst?
6192355000302098 Where is he?
6192355000302099 No, I haven't seen him. Who's this "udurgh?"
6192355000302107 Everywhere.
6192355000302108 In here, too?
6192355000302109 It is a creature that contains the world within it. How else could I put it?
6192355000302110 How do I get to him?
6192355000302111 I've heard that already.
6192355000302112 You'll see for yourself if you go to the old village and look closely. Very closely.
6192355000302113 I've been there, back when I was a kid. It's empty.
6192355000302114 Look at what? The stars? The Lines are truly everywhere.
6192355000302352 Who is Lika?
6192355000302353 Oh, you mean the nice doggy boy I saw at the station? His name is Lika, huh?
6192355000302374 Well, I see you're all experienced burglars here.
6192355000302375 Sure. A train full of needles derailed outside my window. Happy now? \nWhy do you care? We barter 'cause we don't need pins anymore. We've outgrown 'em.
6192355000302376 You're all grown up, aren't you? Now listen up, kid. Only butchers are allowed cutting tools in this town. Got it?
6192355000302377 Scissors for a needle is a good trade. Deal.
6192355000302378 Trust me, kid, you don't.
6192355000302379 Are you a butcher?
6192355000302380 Sort of.
6192355000302381 By birth.
6192355000302382 I'm a surgeon. It's like a butcher, but with a sharper knife.
6192355000302383 And for a very good reason.
6192355000303851 List
6192355000303852 A list of names. The handwriting is clearly Father's. I need to touch this to read it.
6192355000303853 1. Sticky\n2. Capella\n3. Murky\n4. Notkin\n5. Khan\n6. Grace\n7. Taya Tycheek\n8. [unfamiliar steppe sigil]
6192355000307651 
6192355000307652 Home, sweet home welcomed me with its knives honed. What is that supposed to mean?
6192355000307653 Father's funeral will take place tomorrow at dawn. I'll hardly have a chance to pay respects to him until then.
6192355000313751 Don't be afraid. We're all on the same side for now. Aren't we?
6192355000313752 What is there to be afraid of?
6192355000313753 I know who you are. You're the kids from Father's list.
6192355000313755 We're all grateful to you. We know protecting us isn't easy, but you still do it. You make sure we live.
6192355000313757 There are seven of you. But there was an eighth on the list. Where is he?
6192355000313758 Here. For now. He's the udurgh.
6192355000313759 Is he behind that door?
6192355000313760 I can't see him.
6192355000313761 We think it's your father behind the door. But maybe the Eighth is transitioning already… Have you discovered who he is? We're curious too.
6192355000313762 Why?
6192355000313763 No, I don't know yet.
6192355000313764 What's behind the door?
6192355000313765 Because he's the udurgh. If he lives, so do we. If he begins to die, so will be.
6192355000313766 What's an udurgh?
6192355000313767 How do you know that word?
6192355000313768 I want to go back.
6192355000313769 You think you can't see the Eighth because you're looking the wrong way. But he's here. It's fortunate he's still on this side.
6192355000313770 Why?
6192355000313771 This door leads nowhere. There's just more of the same behind it.
6192355000313772 We don't know. And neither will you. We can't enter yet. Nor do we want to. No one does.
6192355000313773 Why is the Eighth nameless?
6192355000313774 I'll open it.

6192355000317753 A hospital has been set up in the town Theatre. Every doctor is there.

6192355000322352 It hosts a hospital now. But the nightly shows still go on.
6192355000331351 Her scream, the poor thing… It must have hurt terribly. Could she… could she have been a person? Clay doesn't scream.
6192355000331352 Who was that? Who was burned?
6192355000331353 What have you done?!
6192355000331354 Hell if I know… They think it was the clay wench… The one who killed the old man. \nBut I guess it wasn't… Oh, poor sinners!
6192355000331355 What wench?
6192355000331356 What old man?
6192355000331357 You're crazy.
6192355000331358 Go away, go away! It's bad enough as is.
6192355000331359 I can't believe my eyes.
6192355000331360 "Welcome home, Artemy."
6192355000332651 Hazelnuts
6192355000332652 Can be munched down—with little effect. The kids here would sell their souls for a handful.
6192355000332653 The game goes like this: find a nut that has traveled far, guess its name, shake it, and listen to stories from the soul trapped inside.\n\nThis originated with the Polyhedron. We didn't play it as kids.
6192355000332654 Rumor has it, a bizarre creature was captured here.
6192355000332851 Something tells me Big Vlad and I have things to discuss.

6192355000334051 Straight Razor
6192355000334052 Too wonky to be used as a weapon or surgical instrument, but kids love it.
6192355000334053 Ten years ago, local bandits used to call themselves "barbers" and brandish a particular style of razors as a mark of their identity. I wonder what became of that culture.
6192355000334054 When a person is done with their name, they discard it.
6192355000334055 Scrap Name
6192355000334056 People in this town are like a flight of birds, and birds don't require names. Individuality is overrated.
6192355000334057 Morphine
6192355000334058 Relieves fear and pain, leaving you drowsy and numb. If I take this before sleep, I'll recuperate better.
6192355000334059 A person is only alive for as long as they feel pain. No matter what Katerina Saburova does, she remains alive.
6192355000334060 Rusty Key
6192355000334061 Unlocks an abandoned room in the Factory. A useful find, since I'm now homeless…

6192355000334152 The ferryman requires payment before he'll let me on the boat. This odd coin will do.
6192355000334153 Kids play "Mice and Guardians" with these. The rules of this game are unknown, but the rumors say they change every day.
6192355000336051 Neomycinum
6192355000336052 Lowers infection. Fixes the Bone Layer of the human body. Doesn't completely heal the patient, but lowers the chance of death.
6192355000336053 The best way to avoid infection is to be dead. Antibiotics, which lower infection at the cost of health in general, are the first step to the grave.

6192355000336070 Covers the face.
6192355000336071 This mask resembles those worn by medical personnel, but instead of sterile gauze, it's made of dirty cloth, and instead of clinging tightly to my face, it hangs loose. Frankly, it's just a rag with two ties.
6192355000336072 Cloak
6192355000336073 Rough cloth that can be used as protective cover, if I'm ever that desperate.
6192355000336074 I'd love to make a tent from this and tell folks scary stories about imaginary catastrophies.

6192355000336080 The 4th Division was relocated here by accident. They never wanted to kill their compatriots among the plague. They were planning to do in in the trenches.

6192355000336085 A tasty dairy drink. Satisfies hunger, quenches thirst.
6192355000336086 The Kin once told me the best tan is made during thunderstorms, or by swearing at the milk as harsh as you can. I tried every cuss in the book, but I never learned the art very well.

6192355000345351 For you, emshen. Heart, liver, kidneys. They still smell of life.
6192355000345352 Why would I need these?
6192355000345353 You're nuts.
6192355000345354 You've killed someone and cut them open, odongh. Is that so?
6192355000345355 Make potions, as your father. Cures from grief, poison, envy, aches. He made any cure when he had good meat. This is good meat. Take it.
6192355000345356 I don't need these.
6192355000345357 This is punishable by death. Don't you know?
6192355000345358 Only a menkhu can cut a body. Is there a menkhu among you?
6192355000345359 Yes, emshen. We do not pity ourselves. Burakh-esegher is already there. We'll follow behind him, then arrive, then be companions. We are content to do this. \nSegne dehe, take these. You'll save many lives.
6192355000345360 What makes you think I need these?
6192355000345361 You do need these, yargachin. Real potions have meat, unente. \nHerbs have borders. Your great father used more than herbs. He made cures from blood and flesh, from those alive.
6192355000345362 But what does it have to do with me?
6192355000345363 What kind of cures?
6192355000345364 No, yargachin. We have broken the law. Those who do not know the Lines cannot cut bodies. We will give our lives, mine and Kooseh. No others.
6192355000345365 But why?
6192355000345366 These are a gift, so you don't risk your life. Don't cut the living unless there is need. Don't cut the dead unless there is need. Even if you're a good menkhu, Boddho does not like it. \nBetter we suffer than you.
6192355000345367 Bayarlaa. I accept your gift, and your sacrifice.
6192355000345368 If my medicine ever needs organs, I'll get them myself. Remember that, and tell the others.
6192355000345369 Fat Vlad is right. You're a bunch of beasts.
6192355000345370 Any kind. Cures for pain, cures for fever, cures for the inner fire. Cures for all three Layers of the body. \nThose who know the Lines can cure any disease with guts and herbs. This is how the world works.
6192355000345372 I'm not Father. I can't make those kinds of cures. Take these organs back.
6192355000345373 So it's a universal method? Curious…
6192355000345374 How do you know about the three Layers?
6192355000345375 Skin. Blood. Thin threads. Your father treated with those.
6192355000345376 …Nerves. Those "threads" are called nerves.
6192355000345377 …Yet he sent me away to learn from those with different views.
6192355000345551 A tincture reveals some symptoms of the disease, showing which of the three Nyespa is damaged. But if a patient is administered too many tinctures, the pain can kill them.

6192355000347651 Didn't we tell you? We used to play a game of "sand pest." Meaning we needed to make medicine, right? So the kids who played it ground pills together and mixed the powders.\nRumor has it, one mixture really did work. But no one remembers which one. The kids who made it have long since grown up.
6192355000347652 Okay. Thank you for this gift.
6192355000347653 They mixed pills together? Sounds like a recipe for disaster.
6192355000347654 \n…Y'know what? Have your poison back. I don't need it.
6192355000347655 It can kill you, for sure. They say it's like lighting a coal fire in your belly—makes your stomach bleed. But it does cure the sand pest, got it?
6192355000347656 Got it.
6192355000347657 Weird… but sure, let's roll with it.
6192355000347658 You children play some strange games.
6192355000347659 Have you eaten the shmowder? C'mon, hurry up.
6192355000347660 I have. Thanks.
6192355000347661 Hold your horses. What's this stuff anyway?
6192355000347662 Isn't it too precious to share with me?
6192355000347663 Why would you give me something so rare?
6192355000347664 I have no choice. One must keep a clean conscience. You taught us that murder is wrong, didn't you?
6192355000347665 So what exactly does this stuff do?
6192355000347666 You told us it's fine to kill bad people, didn't you? So I'm silencing my own conscience, I guess. Asking for forgiveness in advance.
6192355000347667 I see. So what exactly does this stuff do?
6192355000347668 And who is it that you plan on killing, boy?
6192355000347669 None of your business, big guy. No one, perhaps.
6192355000347670 So what's in the box?
6192355000347671 Hurry up and take it. Time is of the essence.
6192355000347672 I already have.
6192355000347673 It's fine. I'll keep it for a while.
6192355000347674 Whatever. We'll find a use for it, of course. I did offer it to you though, so my conscience is clean.
6192355000347675 Yeah. You keep it that way.
6192355000347676 Fine, I've changed my mind. I'll keep it.

6192355000348959 
6192355000348960 This track is an umbilical cord. Our only connection to the outside world.
6192355000348961 How old are you, kid?
6192355000348962 It does resemble that. I thought about it, too.
6192355000348963 Six, if Mother is not mistaken. But I'm not sure. I'm worse with numbers than words.
6192355000348964 Yeah. You speak like you're thirty.
6192355000348965 I've noticed. You two are weird.
6192355000348966 This umbilical cord needs to be cut. Quickly. Sand pest flows through it. And a special emissary will arrive soon. A state inquisitor. Heard of those?
6192355000348967 Of course I have. We could use one, these days.
6192355000348968 I thought they were disbanded two years ago.
6192355000348969 No. This emissary will signal our doom. As we sentence the outside world, so will the inquisitor sentence us. But they're faster. Get it? The umbilical cord needs to be cut. \nPerhaps you can do it? You're a surgeon, after all.
6192355000348970 You mean like… blow it up?
6192355000348971 No. I'm a different kind of surgeon.
6192355000348972 Sure, as an example. I'm not an expert. I'm only six, after all.\nJust destroy the rails. Or we're all dead. State emissaries have no sense of humor. Maybe a scalpel will do? Just cut and be done with it.
6192355000348973 What, the rails? I'd just blunt the blade.
6192355000348974 A contraption would serve better. I think I know just the man…
6192355000348975 I'm trying to divine who it will be. A man or woman? If a man… there will be blood, but it'll be easier for you to prevail, in the end. If a woman… less of our blood, more of yours. That's what my flowers tell me.
6192355000348976 Who are you talking about, kid?
6192355000348977 Heh. Those are some thoughtful flowers.
6192355000348978 We're expecting guests. Bad guests. Violent. So I'm asking my flowers if we'll survive. They're not sure…
6192355000348979 Come on. Our town is hospitable. We honor old traditions.
6192355000348980 It doesn't take a flower to predict our chances of survival.
6192355000348981 I know a good obstetrician, all right… He'll cut whatever needs to be cut, including railroads.

6192355000352351 I don't know what happened to Father's body. I guess they burned him. I wasn't there.
6192355000352352 
6192355000352353 In his letter, Father said that he is to face a grave trial. Or was it "us"? I don't remember…

6192355000352359 
6192355000352360 The dog killer is the doghead who saw me at dawn. He could testify to my alibi. But I gave Notkin my word. The murderer will be tried.

6192355000356968 The bacteria live in infected organs. Meaning I can extract a serum from them.\n\nA tincture mixed with an <b>infected organ.</b> I'll have to get them on my own... from infected bodies. And I'll have to try different organs.
6192355000358451 My master, Vlad Olgimsky, humbly requests your presence. It concerns a most urgent matter.
6192355000358452 Humbly? Doesn't sound like Fat Vlad.
6192355000358453 Too bad. I'm busy enough as it is.
6192355000358454 Tell him I'll come by as soon as I have the time.
6192355000358455 Apologies, I should have been more clear. My master is the younger Olgimsky. Younger for now, anyway.
6192355000358456 Ah, that changes everything.
6192355000358457 You think Fat Vlad's days are numbered? He'll outlive us all yet.
6192355000358458 I can't. I'm busy.
6192355000358459 Olgimsky Jr. wants to see me.
6192355000358463 It is good that you listen, yargachin. Do you know how we Worms came into being?
6192355000358464 You simply spawned from the Earth.
6192355000358465 Mother Boddho made you out of what was left over after making humans.
6192355000358466 You mean according to legend? Same way the Shabnak did. The Earth molds you out of her innards, and spits you out.
6192355000358467 That is right. Our nature is twofold. We're part Earth, part flesh. That is why we possess properties of the Earth, shүү dee. What is no threat to Earth, is no threat to us.
6192355000358468 But you do also possess the weaknesses of flesh, no?
6192355000358469 Quite a deal you've got there. What could possibly threaten the Earth itself?
6192355000358470 We took some properties of flesh, yes? And some from Earth. Joined, they became something new. We've learned to sense herbs. We've learned to understand cattle. We are unaffected by a disease that Earth created.
6192355000358471 Yes, a whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Always.
6192355000358472 What makes you think the disease comes from the Earth?
6192355000358473 Where else? All grows from Earth. When she is joyous, she fills the fields with twyre. When she is irate, she makes shabnak, pits, and disease. Those do not affect us. We are one with Earth.
6192355000358474 So, the usual… Whatever happens, it's Mother Boddho doing it.
6192355000358475 No. You haven't convinced me.
6192355000358476 That's… possible.
6192355000361451 
6192355000361452 
6192355000361453 I brewed… something. But did I choose the right organ?\n\nI need to test this cure on an infected person. Sometimes, infected people just lie on the ground in infected districts. But someone I know by name can serve as a test subject too.
6192355000361454 
6192355000361455 
6192355000361456 An infected brain can be brewed into an antibiotic. It weakens the disease, but does not kill it.\n\nIt's no panacea.
6192355000361457 
6192355000361458 
6192355000361459 An infected heart can be brewed into an antibiotic. It weakens the disease, but does not kill it.\n\nIt's no panacea.
6192355000361460 
6192355000361461 
6192355000361462 Infected kidneys can be brewed into an antibiotic. It weakens the disease, but does not kill it.\n\nIt's no panacea.
6192355000361463 
6192355000361464 
6192355000361465 An infected liver can be brewed into an antibiotic. It weakens the disease, but does not kill it.\n\nIt's no panacea.
6192355000361466 
6192355000361467 
6192355000361468 Infected blood can be brewed into an antibiotic. It weakens the disease, but does not kill it.\n\nIt's no panacea.
6192355000361469 An infected brain produces an antibiotic, too. Still not a panacea.
6192355000361470 An infected heart produces an antibiotic, too. Still not a panacea.
6192355000361471 An infected kidney produces an antibiotic, too. Still not a panacea.
6192355000361472 An infected liver produces an antibiotic, too. Still not a panacea.
6192355000361473 Infected blood produces an antibiotic, too. Still not a panacea.
6192355000361474 
6192355000361475 
6192355000361476 Wrong. Trying out infected tissue leads nowhere. I need to think outside the box here.
6192355000361477 
6192355000361478 
6192355000361479 I'm trying to follow the principles they taught me in medical school. But Dankovsky's education is better—and he gets nowhere. My strength lies in the lore obscure to others.\n\nThe answer is in the steppe.
6192355000361480 
6192355000361481 
6192355000361482 Is it true that bulls never get infected with sand pest?
6192355000363951 
6192355000363952 
6192355000366351 Vlad Olgimsky wants to see me. A dubious success.
6192355000367377 Lara Ravel
6192355000367378 
6192355000367379 
6192355000367380 
6192355000369251 
6192355000370451 Where go you, friend? What plan is next to follow?
6192355000370452 I plan to go on with my life.
6192355000370453 Actually, I don't know what to do.
6192355000370454 Where should I go? What should I start with?
6192355000370455 I want to leave. This town has nothing else to offer me.
6192355000370456 What say the townsfolk?
6192355000370457 The townsfolk?
6192355000370458 Who cares about their babbling…
6192355000370459 They're so alike, aren't they? A backdrop, faceless… They surely know nothing important—right?\nA hive, a swarm, a flock: no use for names. Whatever one knows, they shall all know in turn. 
6192355000370460 Why should I care?
6192355000370461 A hive? A swarm? A flock?
6192355000370462 The crowd is but a many-headed beast. Like it or not: You are but one such head. They know you better than you know yourself. Have you heard them, Burakh? Communication: See how it means finding a common ground?
6192355000370463 Oh yeah, they were eager to communicate with me yesterday. My ears are still ringing.
6192355000370464 I can feel it. Kind of slimy to the touch.
6192355000370465 Sounds unpleasant. A mouthful.
6192355000370466 They all know something of your tale, Burakh. And from each one, a different strand of it. Some know where you're to go. Others, will say why you must go. And some will warn of danger, terrible danger, that you may avoid it.
6192355000370467 So I'm the only one who knows nothing.
6192355000370470 But you said they're a swarm, all alike.
6192355000370471 Untrue! Grown-ups will know what children don't. And children know what steppe Kin do not. Such is the mechanism of life, that turns in its own petty pace from day to day. You choose only whose lips reach your raised ears.
6192355000370472 I'm used to only relying on myself.
6192355000370473 That is because you are alone, Burakh. Confused, alone, losing the plot, Burakh! Does not the map of your own mind suffice? Then talk! Communicate.\nHere, hear me now: Teensies and tots, the town's own young, indeed already know who waits for you today. If you still doubt: Then speak to one. Any child.
6192355000370474 I don't like children.
6192355000370475 No one's lips. I don't care for gossip.
6192355000370476 I guess I should go looking for a child…
6192355000370477 But what should I do exactly? Where should I go next?
6192355000370478 Talk to the crowd, Burakh! To faceless folk, all so alike in their great numbers. Hear them: the buzzing swarm, the squawking flock—the scent, the trail you seek is there in what they say. For life is what they talk about. \nAnd see, Burakh, a doctor's path is too about life.
6192355000370479 They talk about so many things…
6192355000370480 They're too fickle. They say one thing at dawn, and another at dusk.
6192355000370851 Khatangher
6192355000371151 Rusty Key
6192355000371152 And a note. Signed "V. O." To read it, I need to touch it.
6192355000371153 "I've found a spare key, but these key thefts (?) are becoming concerning. Your equipment is far from cheap, is it not? It would serve no one if it gets stolen.\n\nAnd do keep in mind that if our small arrangement is uncovered, I too will have to bear the consequences.\n\n-V. O."
6192355000372151 Simple townsfolk know more than it seems. If I'm unsure what to do, I should talk to them. \n\nI've been told that young kids may be of interest to me right now.
6192355000372152 
6192355000372153 Simple townsfolk know more than it seems. If I'm unsure what to do, I should talk to them. \n\nI've been told that young kids may have information for me.
6192355000372154 The streets are empty. An alarm bell is tolling. The sound comes from the Town Hall.
6192355000373651 Prompter
6192355000375651 The cemetery caretaker's daughter. She looks after the dead herself now, since twyrine did her dad in.
6192355000375652 Looks after the dead?
6192355000375653 Yeah. Twyrine is an evil concoction.
6192355000375654 There you are.
6192355000375655 Here I am.
6192355000375656 How old are you?
6192355000375657 Eight, soon. Five for now.
6192355000375658 Keep growing, then. Don't slow down.
6192355000375659 Got anything interesting to say?
6192355000375660 You need to see Capella. Soon, soon, soon.
6192355000375661 I was on my way.
6192355000375662 Soon? Why?
6192355000375663 Because.
6192355000375664 Short and to the point.
6192355000375665 I'd give you candy, but I'm all out…
6192355000375666 Who is Capella?
6192355000375667 Our mom. Big Vlad's daughter—my dad works at his Factory, you know.
6192355000375668 Why do I need to see her?
6192355000375669 Sorry about your father…
6192355000375670 My, my, my, what have we here? A real cure? To drive me out of the body?
6192355000375671 Hopefully.
6192355000375672 We'll see about that. Soon.
6192355000375673 So that's what it is? Thanks for the hint!
6192355000375674 You are just like your foolish father. Following in his footsteps. Doing what he did, five years ago.
6192355000375675 Really? Did he also make a panacea?
6192355000375676 What did he do?
6192355000375677 I'm very happy to follow his path.
6192355000375678 He did not let me into the Town. Boarded off the Crude Sprawl. It burned out from the inside, to the last soul. With no food, I starved to death. And so the Town returned to its unknowing slumber.
6192355000375679 Sounds like a job well done.
6192355000375680 Cruel. My solution is more humane.
6192355000375682 That was a long time ago. He then had time to think of what happened. To understand that one should not drive me away… Neither from a town, nor from a body.\nI am a heavenly gift, Burakh! Will you also take five years to understand it? You hold poison in your hands!
6192355000375683 Just admit it: You're scared.
6192355000375684 Yes, it is. To poison you.
6192355000375685 In five years, perhaps I will regret this. For now, step aside.
6192355000377551 An incredibly reputable source has informed me that I need to see Capella, Olgimsky's daughter.
6192355000377552 
6192355000377553 An incredibly reputable source has informed me that I need to see Capella, Olgimsky's daughter.
6192355000377554 
6192355000377555 
6192355000377556 It feels like the cure for this pest can only be made from a minotaur. A chimera. Half-human, half-bull. \n\nWhere would I find such a creature?
6192355000377557 
6192355000377558 
6192355000377559 Dankovsky's findings support my own suspicions: common bulls are useless to us. \n\nI'm glad we agree. It doesn't help, though.
6192355000377751 
6192355000378451 No vaccine yet… Another fruitless attempt. But there must be a solution to this problem! There must!
6192355000378452 I guess.
6192355000378453 You look exhausted, erdem. Get some sleep. Twyre is in bloom.
6192355000378454 Tell that to Rubin. He doesn't sleep at all—though, he's well aware of that twyre of yours.
6192355000378455 Is he, I wonder?
6192355000378456 Anyway, how's it going? Any progress?
6192355000378457 I got something. Bulls can't get infected.
6192355000378458 I will if I get a chance. It's like he has a death wish.
6192355000378951 None.
6192355000378952 The whole bull thing… I had one delivered to me. I injected it with a strain, intending to collect a blood sample the next day. But the beast disappeared in the night! Any idea who could be behind it?
6192355000378953 Here, take a look. A sample of bull blood.
6192355000378954 No, I don't.
6192355000378955 If you get a new one, have it guarded.
6192355000378956 …Are you a mind reader?
6192355000378957 Sometimes. A bit.
6192355000378958 Are you sure? I had the same line of thinking. At least that's the first thing I checked.
6192355000378959 And?
6192355000378960 No, I'm not sure. That's why I came to you.
6192355000378961 No. It's just that you have experience with this. You're a scientist. I'm a surgeon.
6192355000378962 Leave it with me, I'll study it. Will only take a few hours. While I'm busy, you may hit the cot over there, by the folding screen. You need it. I've seen corpses prettier than you.
6192355000378963 I can't. I have a lot on my plate. I'll just drop by later.
6192355000378964 All right. Thanks, erdem.
6192355000378965 Well, seems like you were right. But it's of no use to either of us.
6192355000378966 Why is that?
6192355000378967 Indeed, they produce antibodies. A lot of them. But they're useless to us.
6192355000378968 Tell me more.
6192355000378969 How well are you versed in raw sample hyperimmunization for xenogeneic serums? Do you know how immunoglobulins are extracted from a native serum?
6192355000378970 No.
6192355000378971 Say it once more, slowly.
6192355000378972 We didn't learn that in any of my courses.
6192355000378973 Sand pest evolves and mutates in human blood. Fast. It doesn't do that in bulls. It's as though bulls are of no interest to it. But their antibodies <i>could</i> theoretically be useful…
6192355000378974 But?
6192355000378975 Unless the disease is weakened, we can't inject a person with those antibodies. It's too risky. Children, for example, definitely wouldn't survive the procedure. We're too different from bulls.\nMeaning what we need is…
6192355000378976 …A minotaur. A creature that combines man and bull.
6192355000378977 You want me to wait while you find a way to weaken the disease? No way.
6192355000378978 So it's a dead end. I see. Thanks, erdem.
6192355000378979 So bulls are indeed immune to sand pest?
6192355000378980 Maybe to you, erdem. Not to me.
6192355000378981 Of no interest, you say? …Wait a second!
6192355000378982 What?
6192355000378983 No, nothing. Just thinking…
6192355000378984 Artemy Burakh?
6192355000378985 Well?
6192355000378986 Wrong door.
6192355000378987 Aglaya Lilich, a State Inquisitor and Commissar for Critical Emergencies, has arrived in town. She has chosen the Cathedral as her base of operations.\nAs one person responsible for the current situation, you have been invited to a meeting. Immediately.
6192355000378988 <i>I'm</i> responsible for everything that's happening here?
6192355000378989 Immediately? Doesn't sound like an invitation. More like a notice of interrogation.
6192355000378990 Perhaps.
6192355000378991 I don't like this…
6192355000378992 All right. I'll go.
6192355000378993 The sick are my first priority. The Inquisitor will have to wait.
6192355000378994 Artemy Burakh, no one cares what you want. The Inquisitor plans to solve the current crisis in under a day.
6192355000378995 The cows that bellow loudest give the least milk.
6192355000378996 No… what was the name, Burakh? She's no <i>cow.</i> She's a wolf. Got it?
6192355000378997 Wipe the drool up, will you? Or did the Inquisitor appoint you her personal bootlicker?
6192355000378998 If that's so, there must be a line all the way to her office, with or without me.
6192355000378999 Got it.
6192355000379000 I guess I might as well take a look at this miracle.
6192355000379001 <i>Immediately.</i>
6192355000379002 Piss off.
6192355000379003 Heard you loud and clear.
6192355000379006 This will be a long conversation. You must pay complete attention.\nYou don't need to tell the truth, but lying will have consequences. Ready?
6192355000379007 Well, I'd like to take a seat first. Looks like I'm in for something interesting.
6192355000379008 So this is what you inquisitors are like. Not what I expected.
6192355000379009 To face the consequences? I am.
6192355000379010 I don't have to tell the truth? How so?
6192355000379011 Lies are much more informative, even if the truth saves us both time. Shall we begin?
6192355000379012 I think we already have.
6192355000379013 You're the one in charge.
6192355000379014 Are you that cynical, or that brave? You don't seem like a fool.
6192355000379015 That is not for me to judge.
6192355000379016 I am, first and foremost, exhausted. We've seen too much over the last week to be afraid of you.
6192355000379019 Have you already begun the questioning?
6192355000379020 Let us start with the classic problem.\nWould you push an obnoxious fat man in front of a trolley to keep four children from being run over?
6192355000379021 I would.
6192355000379022 I would not.
6192355000379023 This is not a problem. It is a provocation.
6192355000379026 I see.\nQuestion two. Soldiers are about to execute your two daughters. If you offer them one voluntarily, they will only shoot her. If you refuse to cooperate, they will shoot both.\nYour move?
6192355000379027 Look, why are you asking me this? It's not what you really called me here to talk about.
6192355000379028 I can't make such a choice unless I am truly facing this situation, God forbid.
6192355000379029 They'll kill everyone anyway. I won't cooperate.
6192355000379030 I'll choose one.
6192355000379031 I have no daughters. Should we maybe get down to business?
6192355000379032 …You are an intriguing man, Artemy Burakh. Your speech has a unusual cadence to it. A rare thing, indeed.\nBut I believe I have now attuned myself to you. Do you know why I am here?
6192355000379033 I can guess.
6192355000379034 I've been told you are well versed in the local lore and medicine, with its unusual beliefs about the human body. I've been told you are working on a cure for the disease.\nAnd as there can be no cure, this is merely sabotage, am I correct?
6192355000379035 I <i>have</i> made a cure. Here it is.
6192355000379036 And who told you that, I wonder?
6192355000379037 Words, words, words.
6192355000379038 So can a cure be produced, or not?
6192355000379039 It can. I guess.
6192355000379040 I don't know.
6192355000379041 I'm starting to suspect it can't. It would require a creature that does not exist.
6192355000379042 I've also been informed he was a close friend of yours.
6192355000379043 He was.
6192355000379044 Rubin died tonight. Have you not heard?
6192355000379045 I only know he's dead, nothing more.
6192355000379046 Do you know what happened to him?
6192355000379047 How did he die?
6192355000379048 It doesn't matter, now. What matters is why he sent the sample on your behalf rather than his own.
6192355000379049 No idea.
6192355000379050 This is… not unexpected.
6192355000379251 He was acting a bit strange, of late.
6192355000379252 I think he wanted to make up for his… outburst.
6192355000379253 Passing the torch to me, so to speak.
6192355000379254 …I am impressed. The coincidence is so perfect, it's uncanny.\nBurakh, you… managed to surprise me. Did you test it?
6192355000379255 I did. It works.
6192355000379256 Not yet.
6192355000379257 A cure for the sand pest changes… many things. Thousands of life and death questions, of which I am now interested in… four.\nNow I need the recipe, and access to the ingredients. Show me.
6192355000379258 Which four lives are you concerned with?
6192355000379259 …Burakh, are you mad? I don't believe you fully comprehend who I am, or what is happening right now. Is that so?
6192355000379260 I guess.
6192355000379261 I don't have a recipe.
6192355000379262 Ingredients will be an issue. I don't know where to get them.
6192355000379263 I don't care.
6192355000379264 Let's deal with the epidemic first, bicker later.
6192355000379265 What is this sample made of?
6192355000379266 Blood, mostly. Herbal tinctures, but those are secondary. We're lucky it's September. Twyre is in bloom.
6192355000379267 Infected human blood?
6192355000379268 No. I don't know whose blood it is.
6192355000379269 …If I didn't just <i>hear</i> you, Burakh, I'd assume you were trying to make fun of me. Allow me to reciprocate, then.\nDid you know that the whole ordeal with divining your fate is more than mere mystical nonsense? Your fate has been… amputated. I can tell that, for certain.
6192355000379270 Perhaps. I don't really care.
6192355000379271 What do you mean? Are you that apathetic? Or is it that you simply don't understand how painful it is to remain a puppet in the hands of those more powerful than you?
6192355000379272 I act on what I believe is my duty. If someone tries to use my actions to their own ends, I don't care.
6192355000379273 I always try to do the right thing. I don't care if someone orchestrates it. The heart is smarter than the brain.
6192355000379274 …You're a fool.\nAlthough, perhaps… you're not the fool here. Go. This conversation is over.
6192355000379275 So there will be more at some point? Looking forward to it.
6192355000379276 …Do I see a hint of tears?
6192355000379451 Town Hall
6192355000379452 Isidor Burakh's House
6192355000381351 One of Grief's boys got stabbed. Something tells me he deserved it. I don't have time for this.
6192355000381352 
6192355000381353 I came into my legacy… sort of. I traced Father's path. I will take care of his patients. I've proven by deeds that I know the Lines.\n\nFrankly, I was acting at random. Got lucky, I suppose.\n\nBut everyone still considers me a menkhu.
6192355000381354 I came into my legacy… sort of. I traced Father's path. I tried to take care of his patients… unsuccessfully. \n\nBut everyone still considers me a menkhu now.
6192355000381355 The high and the mighty of this town have finally taken notice of a Burakh. The witch hunt is over. \n\nI can now go out safely.
6192355000386851 I had no plans to lift a finger for that scum, but it's hard to let someone suffer. In the end, I did help Piecework.

6192355000394651 Screw you.
6192355000397251 Are you sad?
6192355000397252 What do you care?
6192355000397253 I am.
6192355000397254 I haven't got time to be sad.
6192355000397255 I just wanted you to know: I sympathize. I've never had parents. I've never had anyone… So I know how terribly awful it must feel right now.
6192355000397256 If you never had parents, then you don't.
6192355000397257 I don't need your sympathy.
6192355000397258 What do you want from me?
6192355000397259 I'm sorry I said mean things to you. That's why you think I'm evil, isn't it? But it was the truth.
6192355000397260 It's fine. I don't hold a grudge.
6192355000397261 Get lost.
6192355000397262 What do you want?
6192355000397263 I just wanted you to know that the girl from the cemetery—Grace—is talking to your father right this moment. And I think it strains her a great deal.
6192355000397264 You're lying.
6192355000397265 Are you messing with me again?
6192355000397266 She is…?
6192355000397267 They're speaking. And I think it's killing her… Could you tell her to stop? Please? I think she might listen to you. I feel sorry for her—do you understand?
6192355000397268 This can't be true.
6192355000397269 No, you don't.
6192355000397270 Right this moment, you say?
6192355000397271 Right this moment.
6192355000397272 I don't believe you.
6192355000397273 And he's responding?
6192355000397274 Yes, it can.
6192355000397275 Get lost.
6192355000397276 Is she sitting by his grave or something?
6192355000397277 Why won't you believe I'm a good person, Burakh?! Open your eyes! I speak the truth! Remember, I'm always speaking the truth!
6192355000397278 Fine. I'll take a look. But if it turns out you lied to me…
6192355000397279 You deranged lunatic…
6192355000406175 Why linger? Don't get sidetracked. You have a duty. You have the list. Go back.
6192355000406176 Who are you?
6192355000406177 I like it here better.
6192355000406178 We're watching. Observing. No time for games, now. We must watch.
6192355000406179 Watch what?
6192355000406180 You don't have to. Go home.
6192355000406181 Which of them will enter the door first? I think it will be the older girl. Not the boy in a collar. 
6192355000406182 No one's going anywhere.
6192355000406183 Relax. I'll go first.
6192355000415051 Your place is all dirty.
6192355000415052 Look who's talking. When was the last time you took a bath?
6192355000415080 Isidor's son. Artemy, is that right? Or is it Ersher?
6192355000415081 No, Ersher was my older brother. He died young. I'm Artemy.
6192355000415083 Does it matter?
6192355000415084 Have you come to present yourself to the Mistress? It's taken long enough. I don't believe this is a courtesy visit. That means you have a request.\nSpeak.
6192355000415085 I thought your house had troubles.
6192355000415086 That street rat, Clara, said you were in need of help.
6192355000415087 I don't have any requests. Maybe you have something to ask of me?
6192355000415088 Ha! Now this is funny.
6192355000415089 What's funny?
6192355000415090 So you're all right?
6192355000415091 I'm fine. Healthy and strong enough.\nBut my husband could benefit from your help. He requires your counsel, but is too proud to ask. Alexander would rather bear all on his shoulders than distract you from your work. Could you speak to him?
6192355000415092 You care for him so much… Though, it makes sense.
6192355000415093 I'll speak to him. Is he at the Town Hall?
6192355000415094 Yes, at the Town Hall… Or maybe in his half of the house… I'm not certain. I haven't seen him in a while. Yes, quite a while… Almost a day.
6192355000415095 Really? That's strange.
6192355000415096 Perhaps, if I have the time.
6192355000415097 Very well.
6192355000415098 I'm glad I paid you a visit, Katerina. I'm starting to understand this house.
6192355000415851 
6192355000415852 
6192355000415853 
6192355000415854 
6192355000415855 
6192355000415856 
6192355000415857 
6192355000415858 
6192355000415859 
6192355000415860 
6192355000418351 
6192355000418352 
6192355000418353 Anna Angel… Something bad is happening at her place.
6192355000418354 
6192355000418355 
6192355000418356 One can't throw away bad fortune, or cut it off. But it can be traded. For a spindle, in Anna Angel's case.
6192355000418357 
6192355000418358 
6192355000418359 
6192355000418360 Anna Angel. I traded her bad fortune away from her… but it's not so easy to get rid of a guilty conscience.
6192355000419689 Katerina, are you sick?
6192355000419690 I have a weak heart, but that's nothing.
6192355000419691 May I examine you, just in case?
6192355000419692 I'll be going, then.
6192355000419693 Ah, Burakh. If you've grown weary of your medical duties and seek to join the town guard, you'll leave disappointed. Your expertise would be wasted on the streets. \nNot to mention we're almost out of leather caps.
6192355000419694 I'm used to disappointment.
6192355000419695 Good to see you've kept your sense of humor.
6192355000419696 So what brings you here today? The hunt for the urchin that carries the plague? \nIf so, don't bother—my porch is already packed with volunteers. Pockets full of matches and kindling leave no room for common sense.
6192355000419697 What urchin?
6192355000419698 That's okay, I've brought my own.
6192355000419699 Are they planning another burning?
6192355000419700 I'm here to check on you. You're clearly overworked.
6192355000419701 Don't bother, I'm fine. Everyone is overworked these days. You, Rubin, Dankovsky… All the <i>actual</i> workers, unlike those layabouts outside.\nI could use your help with another matter.
6192355000419702 With those layabouts, I assume?
6192355000419703 Never thought I'd hear praise from you.
6192355000419704 They showed up this morning, claiming to have found the carrier. A homeless little girl, clearly infected, but nonetheless alive and well.\nI know perfectly well what urchin they mean! Be assured, she has nothing to do with this.
6192355000419705 How can I help?
6192355000419706 You're a doctor. They'll trust you more than me. Tell them they're mistaken. Better yet, if they capture her, they can't hurt her. Without her, we're doomed. Isn't that right? Dankovsky told me that, about his vaccine project.
6192355000419707 That's right. I'll tell them to stay their hands.
6192355000419708 Little? Clearly not your… ward, if that's who you're talking about.
6192355000419709 Exactly. They're agitating over nonsense. Someone has to calm them down.
6192355000419710 How exactly?
6192355000419711 Little… little urchin… Wait! That's not Clara, that's another girl!
6192355000419712 What? Which girl?
6192355000419713 I mean… Maybe. Just a thought.
6192355000419714 Never mind.
6192355000419715 I'll remind them of the shabnak hunt and how <i>that</i> went.
6192355000419716 Let them riot. There's no stopping them.
6192355000419717 Why don't you tidy it up, then? Shouldn't be too hard.
6192355000419718 I don't have time. Too busy.
6192355000419719 Busy with what?
6192355000419720 Me too, little one.
6192355000419721 I got a new friend. A talking friend.
6192355000419722 Really? A talking one?
6192355000419723 That's good. It's always nice to have a friend.
6192355000419724 Like a doll?
6192355000419725 No, not a doll.
6192355000419726 Then who?
6192355000419727 She's a secret friend. I don't know why, but she doesn't like you at all.
6192355000419728 Most people don't.
6192355000419729 Just like you, huh.
6192355000419730 Well, I won't pry into your secrets.
6192355000419731 I dunno… Maybe I could be sort of a daughter to you.
6192355000419732 Oh, that's new. Didn't you say you don't like me?
6192355000419733 No, I don't think I could handle a daughter right now.
6192355000419734 Um, well. You're not as bad as your daddy.
6192355000419735 Why are you saying he's bad?
6192355000419736 What do you mean, "sort of"?
6192355000419737 Sort of.
6192355000419738 Don't you trust me?
6192355000419739 No. I'm much worse.
6192355000419740 …
6192355000419741 Well?
6192355000419742 You're a glum little kid, aren't you?
6192355000419743 That's what my friend says. She knows everything in the whole world because she can sneak into any tiny little hole.
6192355000419744 Who is that friend of yours, anyway?
6192355000419745 Maybe I'll introduce you. She asks about you a lot, but doesn't want to meet you yet.
6192355000419746 You do that.
6192355000419747 I'm not so eager, either.
6192355000419748 Any little hole? That's convenient.
6192355000419749 My friend told me she's ready to meet you. That's what she said, she did.
6192355000419750 Who is your friend, Murky? Is she human?
6192355000420751 No. 
6192355000420752 Then what?
6192355000420753 I can't tell.
6192355000420754 How does she talk to you, kiddo?
6192355000420755 Inside.
6192355000420756 Then how can I meet her?
6192355000420757 My friend said that if you come to the Crow Stone at night, she'll show herself.
6192355000420758 Tell her I will be there.
6192355000420759 I have a bad feeling about this friend of yours.
6192355000420760 Why not the graveyard, then? No. You go keep your friend company.
6192355000420761 I don't have time for games, Murky. Can't you see I'm busy making a cure?
6192355000420762 That's why she wants to see you. She's scared.
6192355000420763 Scared of what?
6192355000420764 That friend of yours… Is she so sneaky because people are looking for her?
6192355000420765 Why is she afraid of me, Murky?
6192355000420766 This is troubling… Tell her we can meet.
6192355000421951 Those angry women in your yard… Have you seen them?
6192355000421952 If not for the plague, the entire Town would crowd my yard. They all despise me, you know. Little by little, they encroach on all I hold dear.\nNo matter. You're a doctor, aren't you?
6192355000421953 Yes, I am.
6192355000421954 I'm not here for medical reasons.
6192355000421955 …You're a strong person.
6192355000421960 It's good you've come, Burakh. We require medical assistance, and this time I can't rely on that troublesome Dankovsky.
6192355000421961 Weren't you two getting along?
6192355000421962 "We"?
6192355000421963 He is too… rational for the problem at hand.
6192355000421964 Yeah, I know what you mean.
6192355000421965 In our town, that's an advantage.
6192355000421966 My wife is very ill, Burakh. I'm not sure how to help her.
6192355000421967 What's wrong with her?
6192355000421968 She seems to be losing her mind. She… she is obsessed with… things. Strange things.
6192355000421969 Go on. I'll keep this confidential.
6192355000421970 Katerina believes she cares for our town as if she were… some mystical ruler. She is delirious.\nI think she… communicates with <i>something,</i> some being.
6192355000421971 What kind of being?
6192355000421972 I see. I'll take a look at her.
6192355000421973 I'm not used to speaking about these matters. My mind tells me she is imagining it, but at times, I can hear it respond to her.\nYet, when I enter her room, I find her sitting alone on the bed, and I can't muster the courage to speak to her.
6192355000421974 I understand. I'll examine her.
6192355000421977 It's hard to speak about these things.
6192355000421978 It's impossible for one person to help another.
6192355000421979 I'm a surgeon, not a head doctor.
6192355000422651 
6192355000425352 Prompter
6192355000425353 Look 'round, Burakh, at this abandoned house.
6192355000425354 What about it?
6192355000425355 Of course it's abandoned. Those thugs wouldn't be here otherwise.

6192355000436051 Have you secured all you need to survive?
6192355000436052 I've got nothing I need. Neither food, nor water, nor clothes.
6192355000436053 I'm managing, for now.
6192355000436054 I hardly urge that you mimic those two. But times are dire; and what you need, you may find lurking in empty houses such as these.\nAnd if the owners should return abruptly… You were neither first nor last criminal here.
6192355000436055 So you say I should burgle this place?
6192355000436056 You mean to say I could pin the blame on those two. Right?
6192355000436057 Exactly. 'tis your life at stake; and things are merely things, that you might then repay. You are, indeed, a doctor here, Burakh. 
6192355000436058 Quite so. A doctor, not a burglar.
6192355000436059 So you're like my inner voice, huh? And it's not my conscience speaking.
6192355000436060 Fair enough.
6192355000436951 Something's wrong here.
6192355000436952 
6192355000437851 Your wife considers herself a Mistress. She's supposed to see things no one else does.
6192355000437852 Do you know, Burakh, where a Mistress' power comes from? The prophetic dreams, her influence over others, keeping the Town in balance…
6192355000437853 I don't. Tell me.
6192355000437854 I can see that you're suffering.
6192355000437855 I am suffering—that is true. From pain. From sleepless nights. From impotence.\nRecently, I felt a glimmer of hope that my suffering was at an end. But I was mistaken. There is no hope.
6192355000437856 Why?
6192355000437857 A glimmer of hope? From what?
6192355000437858 The power of a Mistress stems from the earth, and only from the earth, no matter what Nina may have said. \nThe only true power is in the earth. It feeds us all. We grow as grass in the field, and breathe in its spirit.
6192355000437859 There are other powers out there.
6192355000437860 The earth is just soil. Nothing more.
6192355000437861 We're all bound to Earth.
6192355000437862 All these years, I couldn't find the key. I was deaf and weak.\nIt's like musical talent—without it, one can hear, but cannot play. One without the gift cannot take up a melody started by another.
6192355000437863 I don't have an ear for music either.
6192355000437864 All gifts are like that. Surgery, too—each body has its own feeling.
6192355000437865 But recently, the earth started to respond. The tiny people living underground. Mice and rats… and worms, worms too, but mice are more reliable. Rats, they're just like us. Their intelligence equals ours.
6192355000437866 Are you all right?
6192355000437867 You're raving. You need rest.
6192355000437868 The earth and rats are different beings. Don't confuse one for the other.
6192355000437869 And how do you know that? What do you even know about these matters? When the earth must speak to people, it will take any form it wants!
6192355000437870 Calm down. I believe you.
6192355000437871 The Kin say that in these cases the earth makes shabnaks.
6192355000437872 Earth has no mouth, no ears. I see why my past attempts were fruitless.\nBut it took pity on me. It speaks through its herald—to me. He comes to me. Tells me truths. Truths a Mistress must know. All as it should be.
6192355000437873 What does it tell you?
6192355000437874 Could it be your inner voice?
6192355000437875 No.
6192355000437876 Does it talk to you about your fears?
6192355000437877 He says the sand pest and the earth are one and the same. That means there is no salvation.\nWe are bound to the earth. We walk it, we breathe it in, we eat its fruits, we cannot escape it. Our bond is inseverable. He's right. All signs confirm it.
6192355000437878 It might be your inner voice, Katerina.
6192355000437879 Does it ask questions? It's important that you tell me.
6192355000437880 It is the voice of your fear.
6192355000437881 But the disease appeared only recently. The earth has been here forever.
6192355000437882 Ah, I don't know. I don't know anything.\nHere he comes again. He wants to speak to me, but I don't want to! I'm scared, Artemy. When I heard his voice, I began to believe in my power.\nBut now I see this power is useless.
6192355000437883 You need to get some sleep. Sound sleep will help.
6192355000437884 There's no one in this room but us.
6192355000437885 What do you want to hear, human?
6192355000437886 Does the plague really come from the earth?
6192355000437889 Human.
6192355000437890 Rat.
6192355000437892 …What kind of creature <i>are</i> you?
6192355000437893 I'm not.
6192355000437894 What are you, then?
6192355000437895 Someone pinch me.
6192355000437896 A thing of shadow. A thing of the depths. A thing of Earth, flesh of her warm flesh. I know the answers. You don't even know the questions. What seek you within me?
6192355000437897 Happiness, I guess… Same as everyone.
6192355000437898 Truth.
6192355000437899 I'm just seeking you.
6192355000437900 Everything comes from the earth. You came from it, as well, and will return in time. Is coming from the earth so great a crime that one must burn for it?
6192355000437901 Not necessarily.
6192355000437902 What kind of creature are you?
6192355000437903 I am not a creature. You do not know how to ask the right questions.
6192355000437904 Are you the voice of the earth?
6192355000437905 Why are you torturing this woman?
6192355000437906 This woman tortures herself. She calls for me, I arrive. She questions, I answer. Our business is not yours.
6192355000437908 You told Katerina the plague and the earth are one and the same. How so?
6192355000437909 If I kill as many as the sand pest? Yes.
6192355000437910 Teach me, then.
6192355000437911 Here, the earth is still alive. Truly alive. You should know better than most—if you remember your pitiful childhood, of course.\nAll living things resist death. Do you understand?
6192355000437912 But sand pest is death itself.
6192355000437913 I don't.
6192355000437915 Time after time, I'm amazed by humans—the naivety, the conceit. You consider yourselves the crown of creation. That alone puts you above help.\nAny mouse understands its place better than your sorry species.
6192355000437916 Not all of us.
6192355000437917 Only a handful of you think differently—like this unusually sensitive woman. But even they are not prepared to confront that which they seek. The truth snaps them in half like matchsticks. All in all, you are a weak lot.
6192355000437918 Speaking of this woman, leave her alone. I'm asking nicely for now.
6192355000437919 Thanks.
6192355000437920 Mice don't care about these matters.
6192355000437921 How do I kill the plague? Tell me, if you know so much of the earth.
6192355000437922 How does one kill the self in oneself? Answer me this little question, human.\nYou still haven't found any answers to his riddle, other than mundane suicide. Carry on with that. We will help.
6192355000437923 Who is "we"?
6192355000437924 So dumb… How can one be so dumb? So dumb, worthless, and narrow-minded? I hope you don't have any other questions.
6192355000437925 No questions left.
6192355000437926 We're stronger than you think.
6192355000437927 I've got some, but I don't care for your answers.
6192355000437928 I feel that all your words are lies. Or truths twisted beyond repair.

6192355000441860 Who are you? Tell me!
6192355000441861 Yes… It was…
6192355000441862 That's what makes the plague so terrible, you fool! \nYou can't reason with it. There's no method behind it, no mind. No negotiation. There's only death—and if it has a voice, it's yours. Your own voice!
6192355000441864 Imagine your child told you a boogeyman knocks on her window at night. I'd rather check, just in case, than regret it for life.

6192355000451855 What?
6192355000451856 Is it working?
6192355000451857 I doubt you'll make it come in sooner.
6192355000451858 Why do you ask, Uncle Hunchback? And you're so huge... like a giant!
6192355000451859 Can I help?
6192355000451860 I sure am. Eat healthy, and you'll be just as big.
6192355000451861 I'm not a hunchback, I'm just tired.
6192355000451862 There's too few of us. Not enough power.
6192355000451863 Is it like tug-of-war?
6192355000451864 Do you all call at once, or take turns?
6192355000451865 Actually… You are really big. Maybe you <i>can</i> help. Do you know how to train-summon?
6192355000451866 Depends on the train.
6192355000451867 I used to, but it's been a while…
6192355000451868 Look. First you have to wish really, really hard for it to come. Can you do that?
6192355000451869 Definitely.
6192355000451870 Well… I can try.
6192355000451871 Nah, maybe you should go on without me.
6192355000451872 Next, you have to give it a name. It needs to be an adjective. So that it'll be adjacent. Got it?
6192355000451873 "Inevitable."
6192355000451874 "Black."
6192355000451875 "Abrupt."
6192355000451876 "Iron."
6192355000451877 …No, I can't. I'm not good with words.
6192355000451878 Last, find the dead end of a railroad—the southernmost one that goes into the steppe and curves a bit. Stand there and think real hard about how it needs to come soon, and call it by the name held in your mind.\nWill you?
6192355000451879 Perhaps I'll try. Later.
6192355000451880 Fine, if I don't have to say it out loud. At least I won't look stupid.
6192355000451881 Nah, guys, this is too much. See you around.
6192355000451882 Two weeks late already. And I'm waiting for a wonderful parcel…
6192355000451883 Yeah. Food would be a nice delivery, too.
6192355000451884 Candy?
6192355000451885 Two weeks? Huh. That's never happened before.
6192355000451886 Nope. Stamps. And my daddy's peaked cap from the war.
6192355000451887 Well… Sounds cool.
6192355000451888 A whole parcel full of stamps? You're very lucky.
6192355000451889 Racing train. Fast-faster-fastest train. Speedy. Lightning-quick. Uh… Immediate. Ugh… I guess I'm choosing wrong names.
6192355000451890 For the train? Try swearing.
6192355000451891 Those names seem fine.
6192355000451892 What about Hurricane?
6192355000452151 The dog killer is the doghead who saw me at dawn. He will testify to my alibi. We'll meet by the Town Hall.
6192355000452152 
6192355000452153 If I'm desperate, I can find all I need in someone's house. The rest is about picking the lock and shutting up my conscience.

6192355000464451 Did you find Isidor's killer yet?
6192355000464452 Not yet.
6192355000464453 Why are you asking?
6192355000464454 You realize the same people who killed him also caused the plague? He stood in their way once and stopped them. This time, they succeeded.
6192355000464455 What?
6192355000464456 Caused the plague?
6192355000464457 Where's your proof?
6192355000464458 Oh, use your head! Isidor was killed—our only doctor. First murder in town for years! And what happens the very next day? An outbreak. You know, if a fire starts from four corners at once, smart folks call it arson.
6192355000464459 This can't be…
6192355000464460 Who would do such a thing? Why?
6192355000464461 Someone wants to eradicate the local population. Maybe even wipe the whole Town off the map. They don't even care if it takes them to their own grave—they can't live like this, so life is meaningless. \nNow… who has reason to hate the existing order of society? Use your head!
6192355000464462 You're talking about the Kin?
6192355000464463 This is a steppe disease, brought by the steppe people. That's where we should be looking. This plague, it didn't start out of nowhere. It was engineered, <i>directed</i> by someone. Ask anyone. It's not natural!
6192355000464464 You're just making shit up!
6192355000464465 You're lying.
6192355000464466 Perhaps… Perhaps you're right.
6192355000464467 I need to think about it.
6192355000464470 Why should I like you? I like my new… friend, now. My talking friend.
6192355000464471 Why doesn't your friend like me, Murky?
6192355000464472 It's good that you're not alone now.
6192355000464473 …She says it's because you're a doctor. She doesn't like that.
6192355000464474 Strange. Usually, that's the only thing people like about me.
6192355000464475 Sigh… I should've been an ice cream salesman.
6192355000464476 Did you bring me anything yummy?
6192355000464477 Hey, kiddo… Are you, by any chance, sick? Lemme take a look…
6192355000464478 No, I don't have anything for you.
6192355000464479 Well… I'm not scared of this plague at all.
6192355000464480 Everyone's dying from it, Murky.
6192355000464481 Then why do you go away for so long?
6192355000464482 I'm a doctor. I'm saving people from the sand plague.
6192355000464483 Not everyone dies from it. Only people who are scared, and I'm not scared at all.
6192355000464484 Who told you that?
6192355000464485 My new friend.
6192355000464486 Do you mean Clara? Is she your new friend?
6192355000464487 No, it's not Clara at all. It's my special friend. She's always with me.
6192355000464488 Okay, I see. I had imaginary friends, too.
6192355000464489 I don't think your friend knows much about medicine.
6192355000464490 Yeah, sure.
6192355000464491 You should be.
6192355000464492 You don't know anything. Some doctor you are.
6192355000464493 I know that it's deadly, Murky. Nobody's recovered from it.
6192355000464494 So you know someone who got sick and didn't die?
6192355000464495 That's very brave of you!
6192355000464496 My friend wants to know: Why do you keep asking everyone about her? Do you want to make friends with her, too?
6192355000464497 I'm not asking around.
6192355000464498 Not really.
6192355000464499 My friend wants you to know you shouldn't touch those who live in the ground! And don't hurt the earth, either. If you cut the earth, or cure it, nothing will grow there anymore.\nSee? My friend is good.
6192355000464500 That's not true about the earth.
6192355000464502 I told you everything I needed to. There's an awesome worm living underground, too. It has two belly spots—blue ones—and tiny little shoes. And hooves.
6192355000464503 A lot of interesting creatures live underground.
6192355000464504 Friends? I'm in.
6192355000464505 Were you listening by the window?
6192355000464509 Yeah. Dead people live there, too.
6192355000464510 Shoes or hooves. It can have one, not both. Make up your mind…
6192355000464524 She's almost… almost here. She just won't come out for some reason. I need to go… call her, I guess.
6192355000464525 What are you doing here?
6192355000464527 I just wanted… I wanted to show you that she's not really evil at all. I wanted to take her by the hand and bring her to you. She can't just get close to you like that if she's not with me. But if she's with me, she can.
6192355000464528 Why can't she get close to me?
6192355000464529 I'll find your friend myself, and I'll decide if you should even be friends with someone like that. Go home.
6192355000464530 You should go hide behind those rocks and wait. Just keep looking at me. I'll wait for her, sort of like a lure. She'll come to the fire when she thinks I'm alone. Then you'll see I'm not making her up.
6192355000464531 Very well, let's see. But I won't wait long. If nobody comes out in ten minutes, we're going home.
6192355000465360 
6192355000465361 
6192355000465362 Misfortune has found its way into the Rod. Or has it always lived there? \n\nI'm no fan of the Saburovs, but if I decide to pay them a visit, I should start with Katerina. Her room is at the back of the mansion.
6192355000465461 Finally, someone! So I was right to wait here… Maybe you, at least, know where she was buried?
6192355000465462 Who?
6192355000465463 You and I might have a friend in common, actually… Does yours have burning eyes and wear a long-nosed mask?
6192355000465464 No… Do you have a friend like that?
6192355000465465 I was just joking.
6192355000465466 Not yet.
6192355000465467 Then she's no friend of mine.
6192355000465474 Is this Murky's friend? There's another little girl hiding inside you, isn't there?
6192355000465477 No. Not a girl, not one, not inside.
6192355000465478 Then what is it?
6192355000465479 I'm picking a family for myself. I think I'm going to be together with my friend. We'll be sisters… or maybe she can even be my mommy. \nAnd I don't have any reason to like you. You're never even home.
6192355000465480 Is that why you brought me here? You made it all up, didn't you?
6192355000465481 I'll try to be home more often. Go home, little one. I don't like that new friend of yours.
6192355000465482 I suppose I don't even have a home. Can you really call that place a home?
6192355000465483 Why?
6192355000465484 She's dangerous. I think I know what she really is.
6192355000465485 Call it a hunch.
6192355000465486 You should just listen to me, like you would to your father. Understood?
6192355000465487 You will go home right this minute.
6192355000465488 When are you coming home?
6192355000465489 Soon.
6192355000465490 I don't know.
6192355000465491 That's up to your friend—hopefully, former friend.
6192355000465492 A lure? That's right! You know she's not your friend!
6192355000465493 You don't know that!
6192355000465494 I'll take a look and tell you later.
6192355000465495 There's nothing to <i>know</i> here. Just trust me.
6192355000465539 What do you want, Burakh? Why are you here? Go do your job, tinkerer! Have you already avenged your father? Come into your inheritance? Saved everyone on the list? Visited the Kin? Have you made a cure?
6192355000465540 So you're Murky's friend?
6192355000465541 Are you dense? You idiot… I'm keeping Murky from the plague. Do you understand? I'm doing it because you can't even watch over one child!
6192355000465542 I'm the one keeping her from the plague. And I have my doubts about you.
6192355000465543 I thought you were a grown man, Burakh. Did you honestly come to believe the disease has a mind, a goal, some agenda? That it walks on clay legs and talks to Murky? That it'll come here to tell you something?
6192355000465544 That's about it.
6192355000465545 How do you know all this?
6192355000465546 That's what I thought: If the plague has a form, it must resemble you.
6192355000465547 I need to check on something… in order to protect that girl over there.
6192355000465548 What do you mean I can't? I can.
6192355000465549 I think the plague has been talking to her for the last few days.
6192355000465551 
6192355000465552 
6192355000465553 Reflections writhe in the Rod's corners—more than in other houses.
6192355000465554 
6192355000465555 
6192355000465556 The townsfolk firmly believe the Saburovs are harboring a plague carrier in their house.
6192355000465557 
6192355000465558 
6192355000465559 Mob justice doesn't solve anything. But who is this orphan carrier girl they're after? I have a bad feeling.
6192355000465560 
6192355000465561 
6192355000465562 I assuaged the crowd, but the cause of their anger still haunts me. Is it true that not all victims of the sand pest die?
6192355000465563 
6192355000465564 
6192355000465565 An orphan girl named Murky knocked on my door. I feel like it's not the last I'm seeing of her. \n\nI think she doesn't like me. What do I do with her…
6192355000465566 
6192355000465567 
6192355000465568 
6192355000465569 
6192355000465570 
6192355000465571 Some friend of Murky's dislikes me.
6192355000465572 
6192355000465573 
6192355000465574 Rumor has it, the outbreak didn't happen by chance. Someone <i>made</i> it happen. A person. Is it possible?
6192355000465575 
6192355000465576 
6192355000465577 
6192355000465578 
6192355000465579 
6192355000465580 Katerina Saburova is sick. And it seems like the governor can also hear the voices in her head. The power of love? Or something shadier?
6192355000465581 
6192355000465582 
6192355000465583 The spirit tormenting Katerina is real, because Living Earth is real. It bears things like this Rat Prophet… and Sand Plague itself.
6192355000465584 
6192355000465585 
6192355000465586 Murky's friend will wait for me after dark by the Crow Stone. I don't like this one bit.
6192355000465587 Some friend of Murky's wanted to meet me at night in the steppe. No, I don't have time for kids' games right now.
6192355000465588 
6192355000465589 
6192355000465590 
6192355000465591 
6192355000465592 
6192355000465593 So Murky's friend is the disease? What the hell? Who speaks in its voice? Who is making fun of me? And if it is alive, what does it want?\n\nTo hell with it. Where's Murky?
6192355000465594 
6192355000465595 So Murky's friend is the disease? What the hell? Who speaks in its voice? Who is making fun of me? And if it is alive, what does it want?\n\nAnd could Murky…
6192355000465596 
6192355000465597 
6192355000465598 No one knows where Murky is buried.
6192355000465656 Was she… buried?
6192355000465657 Murky.
6192355000465658 …She was buried? By whom?
6192355000465659 They put her six feet under, but no one knows where. Capella can't see anything… We thought that if she can't see it, then maybe Murky is still alive somewhere. You don't know, either?
6192355000465660 I don't.
6192355000465661 …She loved you, you know. Murky, I mean. She was overjoyed to find you. All she wanted in the world was to bring her parents back, little weirdo. She believed it might somehow happen—through you.
6192355000465662 I can't bring the dead back.
6192355000465663 …I see.
6192355000465664 When did you last see her?
6192355000465665 So there is still hope?
6192355000465699 Will you protect all of us? The people on your father's list. I think they're the most vulnerable…\nEspecially Murky. I'm worried about her.
6192355000465700 I'm doing my best to look after you all.
6192355000465701 What about Murky?
6192355000465702 How do you know?
6192355000465703 I am my mother's daughter. I know things… I feel currents, sometimes.\nDo you think I can become a real Mistress? Will the butterfly emerge from the cocoon? One of these days, maybe?
6192355000465704 Maybe. I'm not an expert.
6192355000465705 Of course.
6192355000465706 Murky gets… hunches. She's almost a feral child, improperly raised. \nBut she senses things, knows everything from somewhere. Perhaps the earth tells her. Perhaps that's her gift… Understanding its words.
6192355000465707 She knows everything? Like what?
6192355000465708 Tell me more about Murky.
6192355000465709 Seems every other kid here has some gift.
6192355000465710 Earth is soil. Nothing more.
6192355000465711 Do you know why she followed you? How she knows you're Isidor's son?
6192355000465712 No. How?
6192355000465713 Yeah, why <i>did</i> she follow me? I wondered.
6192355000465714 Five years ago, your father, Isidor Burakh, made a grim decision. The outbreak was impeded, but many died.
6192355000465715 …And Murky's family lived in the Crude Sprawl. Didn't they?
6192355000465716 Do you now understand?
6192355000465717 She must hate me.
6192355000465718 I know.
6192355000465719 No. But she feels you are connected.\nHer heart is kind. She doesn't blame you for your father's deeds. And she doesn't remember her parents, because she was very small when it happened. But their absence pains her.
6192355000465720 Connected… Aren't we?
6192355000465721 She's a sweet girl.
6192355000465722 …I do.
6192355000466151 They say the Saburovs nurture the plague. That they harbor a carrier. A girl.
6192355000466152 What carrier?
6192355000466153 They also say you shouldn't waste breath on idle chatter.
6192355000466154 Hell if I know… That's why we're here, to get him to give her up, but he won't. Keeps lying, saying there's no carrier, trying to talk us down. Soon he's gonna cause people to hunt down women in the street, like on that first day.
6192355000466155 Why would they do that?
6192355000466156 And what will you do with her if he does give her up?
6192355000466157 Are you dense, pal? The plague plays right into Saburov's hands. The Kains and Olgimskys have always resented him, but now he wields power. \nHe's pulling out all the stops. <i>Promoting order,</i> he says. Some order!
6192355000466158 Nonsense. He's not like that.
6192355000466159 Who knows, maybe you're right.
6192355000466160 Only one thing to do. Put her back where she came from. Into the earth.
6192355000466161 If they do find a carrier, Saburov won't need your help to deal with them.
6192355000466162 Eager to kill, aren't you?
6192355000466163 Well, healer, will you tell us about the carrier? Is she in there? With him?
6192355000466164 Perhaps. I haven't seen.
6192355000466165 Listen to me, idiots. There is no carrier! It's all nonsense and idle talk.
6192355000466166 Listen carefully, and tell everyone. Even if there is a carrier, that carrier is our salvation.
6192355000466167 What does that mean?
6192355000466168 We'll make a cure from that person's blood. A vaccine. We need the carrier alive for that.
6192355000466169 Nothing for you to question me about. Just do what I tell you and you'll live.
6192355000466170 Is this true, healer?
6192355000466171 I always tell the truth.
6192355000466172 No. I'm kidding.
6192355000466173 Listen to me: no mob justice! Not one girl gets hurt. Do you understand me?
6192355000466174 They also say she's not alone. Not everyone dies from this sickness! Do you get what that means?
6192355000466175 What?
6192355000466176 I do. But we need to make sure, and that's not your job.
6192355000466177 According to my data, everyone dies. No one's survived.
6192355000466178 If there are people who get sick but don't die, the plague must come from them!
6192355000466179 "If."
6192355000466180 That's none of your concern. Go on home now.
6192355000466181 What do you know about connections? That's not how any of this works, you fool!
6192355000466351 She's shown her true colors, the false Mistress. If our beloved white swan Victoria were here, she'd be out on the street, shielding people from trouble.\nAnd Nina… if she were around, none of this would be happening. That's the sort of power <i>she</i> had.\nBut this one just locks herself up at home… A useless Mistress.
6192355000466352 Who are you talking about, ma'am?
6192355000466353 Your Victoria could do nothing about a plague like this.
6192355000466354 I remember Nina. After her, a plague feels like little more than a funhouse.
6192355000466355 You say Victoria… couldn't? You're just faithless! She would! She used to shelter the Town under her bright wings! She used to be our white mother! She would let no trouble in.\nWhat do you even know? Where did you even come from?
6192355000466356 You speak of Mistresses as if they work miracles. They're just women.
6192355000466357 That Saburov woman, Katerina. She's never had power. Utterly barren. We used to pity her, but now she's worse than barren—she sows poison.
6192355000466358 Nonsense. What poison?
6192355000466359 Sorry. I feel sorry for us all.
6192355000466360 So she was a woman of character. So what? They're all like that. Why ask more of her? And what power she had! She radiated heat, like a blazing forest fire. This one doesn't even give off light.
6192355000466361 "This one"?
6192355000466362 A fine excuse. So you like power, then?
6192355000466363 You know nothing, you dolt. If you don't know the power of the Mistresses, then shut your mouth and show some respect.\nHave some sense. Some give off heat, some give off light, some give off poison. We sense that she gives off poison.
6192355000466364 I suppose I should be going.
6192355000466365 No. I don't understand.
6192355000466366 If a person comes to think that you wounded their heart with deceit, does that mean that you truly are guilty of it? Moreso in regards to their feelings, their hopes, and their fears?
6192355000466367 Yes. You betrayed that person's expectations.
6192355000466368 No. Not unless you did intend to deceive them.
6192355000466369 First, we must find the truth. Then the falsehood. Then learn to pick them apart. Only after that can we answer such a question.
6192355000466370 What does this have to do with Alexander Saburov? Are you not his reflection?
6192355000466371 What indeed. I just asked you a question.
6192355000466372 Then: Yes, I suppose.
6192355000466373 Then: No.
6192355000466374 Then: This is a trick question, I shall not answer.
6192355000466375 Then: I forgot what the question was. Probably means it was a threatening sort of question.
6192355000466376 Our town's always had three ruling houses: Kain, Olgimsky, Saburov! Each one would reign o'er their own domain. The Kains were our head; the Olgimskys our belly. But pray, Burakh, tell me what the Saburovs held.
6192355000466377 They were the bones.
6192355000466378 They were the hands.
6192355000466379 They were the nerves.
6192355000466380 The Kains were weavers of laws and of dreams; the Olgimskys were masters of money and men. To Saburov remained an executive power: Their task was to keep the streets in order, in a town where there was almost no crime.
6192355000466381 Wasn't there?
6192355000466382 I guess the genocide that the Olgimskys were perpetrating against the Kin doesn't count as "crime."
6192355000466383 The Kains are proud to call themselves criminals, though. I always remembered that.
6192355000466384 'Tis funny, you see. When the Houses agreed to manage the Town, Saburov was in name the triumvirate's head.\nI know not what that meant, nor what it entailed.
6192355000466385 Veto power, maybe?
6192355000466386 It entails exactly what is happening now. They could seize control in face of a mortal crisis.
6192355000466387 I won't ask you what it meant, then.
6192355000466388 Saburov still believes that his mission is clear: Keep order! He may not look the part, but he is not a fool. He knows duty entails the pursuit of order through fear, and that violent means stain the soul of a duty-bound man.
6192355000466389 Stain the hands, too.
6192355000466390 Thank you, Reflection. I will keep this in mind.
6192355000466391 Ah, yes. The favorite excuse of vicious tyrants everywhere.
6192355000466392 When denied respect, is a man not wounded, Burakh? Not even for evil he does, but for failing to do much at all. Even more when you had not a chance to do any deed of note. There are only so many of those going 'round.
6192355000466393 Can't say. People seem to respect <i>me.</i>
6192355000466394 Nonsense. The world is full of opportunities for greatness.
6192355000466395 Perhaps it is now. But not in ordinary times.
6192355000466396 To live a year of your life without doing something contemptible is already an outstanding feat. One I've never seemed to quite accomplish…
6192355000466397 What I'm doing now will be enough for the rest of my life.
6192355000466398 I speak not of you, Burakh, I speak of my master!\nHis pride, his soul, has been wounded by lack of respect. He needs his authority, now more than ever. The Kains, the Olgimskys, never trusted our House. Perhaps this distrust never turned to contempt. But distrust it was, dear sir.
6192355000466399 What are you getting at, Reflection?
6192355000466400 Indeed, I see where Saburov's pain comes from.
6192355000466401 Respect is a crutch for those without better things to care about.
6192355000466402 Nothing. I've said my peace. You're a healer; one thinks you might care to learn more about pain.
6192355000466403 I am concerned with a different kind of pain.
6192355000466404 You think correctly.
6192355000466405 The wisest women in our town would take the title "Mistress."\nA word that calls to mind the tales of ancient sorcery. Do you believe in such a thing?
6192355000466406 Mistresses were two extraordinary women in the Town's ruling families. There was something undeniably uncanny about them.
6192355000466407 It's not a matter of belief. They're not goddesses.
6192355000466408 Who do you think the Mistresses are, then?
6192355000466409 Steppe-son, you bear the marks of nature's flow upon your skin; but mind how thin the twyre runs in your veins. You are more stone than Earth.\nLike ships must catch the wind in sails, our Town relies on Nature's flow.
6192355000466410 Nature is everywhere. Everything lives by her flows.
6192355000466411 Such "flows" are simple enough. Heat is their nature.
6192355000466412 None know how many winding paths there are; none know what forces run their course. There are no words for what they hold; to see them calls for gifted senses, gifted minds. And should one hear the call of such a gift: What feats, what brave new world, they'd find with it! Like being the very first to hoist a sail.
6192355000466413 Such gifts are not yet the domain of mankind.
6192355000466414 We lost that gift when we learned to make tools.
6192355000466415 Victoria Olgimskaya and Nina Kaina: One five-foot-six, one six-foot-one; mortals. But seen as giants! For they could feel the Powers move across the firmament…
6192355000466416 Women can sense these things.
6192355000466417 And?
6192355000466418 Some merely know the flows. Some feel them, now and then. A mistress tastes those waves, might drink of them. And when the stars align, might ride them. The people felt such women knew the workings of the world itself…
6192355000466419 And that's it?
6192355000466420 How is that not enough? The mistresses kept their hands quite clean of rough and tawdry magics. Victoria knew not a spell that brought the dead to life. But Nina did inspire fear. Along her steps, doors shut and children hid! But those two women gave the Town its life. None know the hows or whys of such a power.
6192355000466421 I've heard that Victoria did raise the dead. But that's probably just a rumor.
6192355000466422 Clearly they didn't bolt those doors tightly enough.
6192355000466423 Yes, I knew a man like that. Nobody knew how, but his presence would severely change the… pressure. Every time.
6192355000466424 Two Mistresses there were, and all felt that to be correct. For one was Night and one was Day; one was Heat and one was Cold; one was Storm, and one was Calm. Contrast reigned.\nNina held court over schism and unease; Victoria's domain was peace and nourishment.
6192355000466425 The Bright and the Fearsome, as they were called.
6192355000466426 The Dark and the Warm. Right, I recall.
6192355000466427 Taste and Laughter.
6192355000466428 The Kains had Nina; the Olgimskys had Victoria. When Saburov returned with his young bride, my Katerina, there was no place for her in such a scheme.\nBut her hairs would raise, and her skin would sense it. And once Nina did perish, Katerina took her place and seized a name for herself…
6192355000466429 …Nina, the Wicked.
6192355000466430 …Nina, the Wild.
6192355000466431 …Nina, the Nocturnal.
6192355000466432 Nina did only drive men to fear. But Katerina, naive as she was, mistook the nuance of Nina's role for a romantic darkness. And that in turn would drive her down the road to frightful things.
6192355000466433 And nobody really noticed.
6192355000466434 Luckily, she never became a second Nina.
6192355000466435 And is that such a blessing, sir? Nina did not just take children from their mothers.\nShe tinged our lives with color. Recall how in her days to walk the streets was an adventure.
6192355000466436 Yes, I remember those days.
6192355000466437 Perhaps our town would have been like that without her. It's not like anyone can check.
6192355000466438 Victoria died, and Katerina replaced both Mistresses. Two roles to play; she grew into neither.\nBut patient folk would wait for her to find her gift. And some may still await her day.
6192355000466439 True, it is easier to be fearsome than kind.
6192355000466440 She should have stayed out of those games.
6192355000466441 She took our… strange customs too seriously.
6192355000466442 Wild Nina begat Maria, the talented. Warm Victoria begat Capella, the gifted.\nMy Mistress has no one… She'd take any child, to raise as her kin, gift or no gift.
6192355000466443 Is she afraid?
6192355000466444 Is she in pain?
6192355000466445 Is she ashamed?
6192355000466446 She sits in darkness, weaving blackest yarn from heaviest thoughts.\nShe'd rather knit baby socks…\nInstead, she drapes black folds around her throat and chokes.
6192355000466447 There, there… No need to cry.
6192355000466448 Don't whine, Reflection.
6192355000466449 At night we hear her talk to herself, mad: I failed to give life to the Town, talentless! I failed to nourish town or child, giftless! I failed to guard against plague, useless! I am barren!
6192355000466450 I could prescribe something for her nerves.
6192355000466451 A grown woman, still playing at being a sorceress!
6192355000466452 She'll manage. Probably. There's definitely still time for her to have a child.
6192355000466453 But have you heard? Such wondrous news! We wait, in awe, for our new daughter, true and talented!\nAnd such a talent, sir! A blessed gift! And now we are not two but three; and one will much more mighty than two be.
6192355000466454 I'm happy for your mistress, Reflection.
6192355000466455 So where is this girl?
6192355000466456 She's pregnant?
6192355000466457 The daughter's adopted, and near grown up. It is for the best; we wait too long, and now, and orphan child will have a home at last.
6192355000466458 Can I see her?
6192355000466459 Yes, it's for the best.
6192355000466460 She walks the streets, and does her chores… Bound to this plague, somehow. She has the gift, so she must stay to stop the plague. Salvation can and must come from the House of Saburov.
6192355000466461 Your mistress has gone mad, Reflection.
6192355000466462 I've met that girl. She does indeed carry a long list of chores…
6192355000466463 What is this gift? Is that even important right now?
6192355000466493 Wait! Strike, if you will, but hear me. I came to entrust the lives of my new parents to you.
6192355000466494 I wonder what you did to your old ones.
6192355000466495 There was someone gullible enough to adopt you?
6192355000466496 "Strike, if you will, but hear"? Picked up some Latin from Dankovsky?
6192355000466497 Actually, it's Greek. Want me to give you the context?
6192355000466498 No need. I know it.
6192355000466499 You can distinguish Greek from Latin? I'm impressed.
6192355000466500 What? Why would you say that? I never even knew them. I've been an orphan for as long as I can remember.
6192355000466501 I didn't know.
6192355000466502 Right, that's what I figured.
6192355000466503 There was.
6192355000466504 Are they sick?
6192355000466505 I pity them.
6192355000466506 There's trouble looming over both of them. Something with their house. It's a house of troubles. My adopted mother is especially in danger. Can you help us? Can you watch over them? Please.
6192355000466507 If no one's dearer to you, watch over them yourself.
6192355000466508 Wait a second. Don't I ruin everything I touch? Isn't that what you told me?
6192355000466509 Forgive me. Please forgive me. Please.
6192355000466510 Why don't you help them yourself? Aren't you supposed to be the greatest healer in the world?
6192355000466511 I forgive you. But I want answers.
6192355000466512 I… I did take care of them. But I can't any longer. I need to disappear for a while. Maybe even forever.\nDon't ask… Please. You'll understand soon enough. But tell me you'll do it, Burakh! I know you have a warm heart!
6192355000466513 Fine. Who are they?
6192355000466514 Tell them to come to me.
6192355000466515 A warm heart and a cool head. I can tell that something's off. I'm saying no.
6192355000466516 The Saburovs. They're my new mother and father.
6192355000466517 You're a good fit for each other.
6192355000466518 The Saburovs… A house of troubles. I see.
6192355000466519 They can't. They won't. They don't know.
6192355000466520 They're bedridden?
6192355000466521 Don't know about what?
6192355000466522 Will you do it? They'll never ask anyone themselves! Mother thinks the whole Town hates her for failing to protect them from the plague! \nAnd father… He takes all evil on himself, so that no one else will be soiled. But mother has the worst of it. She needs a doctor…
6192355000466523 I'll do it. Be on your way now. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.
6192355000466524 I'll pay her a visit, but I can't promise I'll save her.
6192355000466525 No. Watch over those bloodsuckers yourself.
6192355000466526 So... have you seen my parents? How are they doing?
6192355000466527 Not yet.
6192355000466528 They care for one another. But what about you? Why aren't you taking care of them?
6192355000466529 Saburov is in trouble. People are unhappy with him—because of you.
6192355000466530 What...? People harass them? Because of me? Oh, but what do they want... why can't they just leave me alone!
6192355000466531 Is it true that you're immune to the plague?
6192355000466532 They think you're a carrier. Is it true?
6192355000466533 Oh my God, sweet God in heavens, obviously, seriously, definitely, clearly I'm not!
6192355000466534 Phew. You got me there for a moment.
6192355000466535 People believe that there is an urchin girl that the disease doesn't take for some reason. Do you know of many other suspects?
6192355000466536 Uh, a ton! There are lots of urchin girls around, especially these days.\nBut no matter how many there are, those rumors are utter drivel! Sand pest kills everyone it touches. There's no salvation... unless I help.
6192355000466537 Really?
6192355000466538 Many people think you're a saint. But there's something uncanny about you.
6192355000466539 Fools! Utter fools! They all think I'm connected to the plague because... because... I don't know why! Guess it's because I'm always first wherever calamity strikes. But that's because I rush to help...
6192355000466540 You're scaring me, Clara. And not just me.
6192355000466541 Help—by putting them out of their misery, huh?
6192355000466542 I can't. I can't go there. I don't want to make them look suspicious...
6192355000466543 Why would you make them look suspicious?
6192355000466544 You already have.
6192355000466545 Forget it.
6192355000466546 You're connected to this plague. Aren't you, Clara?
6192355000466547 I suspect you're patient zero, as the Bachelor would have put it.
6192355000466548 Then go, please! Before it's too late!
6192355000466549 I know!
6192355000466550 They're wealthy. They live in a sturdy house. Others need my help more.
6192355000466651 I'm a good person, Burakh. You can tell lies from truth, don't you? Then you know I'm not lying! I'm a good person.\nAnd if anyone tells you I'm a shapeshifter... those are just rumors. Shapeshifters don't exist!
6192355000466652 Fine. I believe you.
6192355000466653 No. I don't trust you.
6192355000466654 All kinds of things exist...
6192355000466951 The Rod
6192355000466952 Why did Clara tell me that Katerina requires help? She seems fine. Her husband, however…
6192355000466953 An angry mob pesters Alexander Saburov. They're looking for the plague carrier.
6192355000466954 Katerina's Reflection
6192355000466955 Alexander's Reflection
6192355000466956 Detractor
6192355000466957 Detractor
6192355000466958 Clara
6192355000467051 Murky
6192355000467052 My friend told me to tell you this: Why are you asking around about her? Do you want to make friends with her?
6192355000467053 I'm not asking around about her.
6192355000467054 Not really.
6192355000467055 Friends? Sure.
6192355000467056 My friend told me to tell you: You can't touch the ones who live in the earth! Also, you can't hurt the earth. If you cut it open or cure it, or something like that, things won't grow there anymore.\nSee? My friend's good.
6192355000467057 Things will grow there, actually.
6192355000467058 That fellow in the rat costume, is he a friend of yours?
6192355000467059 Were you eavesdropping by the window?
6192355000467060 Well, I just told you everything in general. Also, there's a wonderful worm living in the earth. It has two blue spots on its belly and tiny boots on its tiny feet with tiny hooves.
6192355000467061 Plenty of wonderful critters live in the earth.
6192355000467062 Yeah. You know what else lives in the earth? Corpses.
6192355000467063 Hooves <i>and</i> boots? Make up your mind.
6192355000467064 A rat costume? Ooh, can I have a rat costume too?
6192355000467065 Forget it. I'm just seeing things.
6192355000467066 It won't look good on you.
6192355000467251 Rat Prophet
6192355000467252 Clara
6192355000467680 I had a fight with Sticky, all because of your father again! I'm so worried now… What if we never make up?
6192355000467681 "Again"? What do you mean, "again"?
6192355000467700 Because! Everything is bad because of your dad. He always made everyone sad.
6192355000467701 Really? Everyone?
6192355000467703 What did you fight about?
6192355000467704 Don't worry about it. I bet it's something silly.
6192355000467705 I know why you feel this way, Murky…
6192355000467706 I do.
6192355000467707 But he really didn't kill your parents. The disease did.
6192355000467708 He didn't want to do it, Murky.
6192355000467709 Yes, he did.
6192355000467710 Why do you think so?
6192355000467711 Sticky says that your father is good, that he was smart and kind to people. But I know that's not true.
6192355000467712 Why isn't it?
6192355000467713 No, he's good. He was. It's true.
6192355000467714 If it weren't for him, we would be living like we used to, and nothing would be bad.
6192355000467715 How do you know that?
6192355000467716 Is your friend telling you things again?
6192355000467717 I know because I feel that way.
6192355000467718 Well… I guess there's no convincing you otherwise.
6192355000467719 My friend would never lie, you know. She talks about it, too.
6192355000467720 Are you sure?
6192355000467721 I guess she overrules me and Sticky, then.
6192355000467722 What did my father even do to you?
6192355000467723 Your dad… He killed my parents.
6192355000467724 That's new. Where did you hear that?
6192355000467725 That's what I heard. He locked them up so they couldn't go outside, so they got sick and died. I was just two years old.
6192355000467726 Someone told you a ridiculous lie!
6192355000467727 Damn… The First Outbreak…
6192355000467728 Murky, he didn't kill them. They died from the plague. He had no choice.
6192355000467729 Don't cry, little one. Please don't cry.
6192355000467730 I hope I can make up with Sticky… I don't hate having a brother at all. He grumbles a lot, but he's really nice. He makes food for me. Yesterday, he brought me sugar! He put it over a candle and made a piece of candy…
6192355000467731 You'll make up. I'm sure of it.
6192355000467732 Where did that rascal find it?
6192355000467733 Of course you don't hate having a brother…
6192355000467744 Ah, Burakh. As you can see, we're making progress with your case. There's plenty of evidence against him.
6192355000467745 What evidence?
6192355000467746 Well?
6192355000467747 Put him in prison. Let him stay there. It's safer that way.
6192355000467748 It's not him. I'm sure of it. You can release him now.
6192355000467749 That, Burakh, is ultimately not your decision. I only wanted your opinion. I will do with him as I see fit.
6192355000467750 Very well.
6192355000467851 Solid evidence. Would you like to speak with him yourself?
6192355000467852 What evidence?
6192355000467853 …That's not what I expected.
6192355000467854 So what are you going to do with him?
6192355000467855 In times like these, we can't get bogged down with investigations and hearings. Throw him in prison. Let him stay there… until things calm down.
6192355000467856 Wait. I want to speak with him first.
6192355000467857 Will they? I wouldn't want to find myself in prison at a time like this.
6192355000467858 I'll find the murderer myself, Governor. I trust myself more.
6192355000467859 Then my opinion is this: Prison's no place for an innocent man.
6192355000467860 Ah, yes. Burakh. Just when I needed you… Although, I actually need you for another matter. I'll figure out what to do with this wretch myself.\nI suspect foul play. Since you're here, you may speak with him, if you like.
6192355000467861 What other matter?
6192355000467862 I wish to talk to you alone. Make this troglodyte's acquaintance if you like, or simply wait. We can start as soon as I send off the convoy.
6192355000467863 Wait. I'll speak with him.
6192355000467864 No, don't do anything to him without my input. I have a few questions to ask him first.
6192355000467865 Go ahead and send them off. I'll pay him a visit in prison later.
6192355000468251 I would, thanks.
6192355000468252 He was with Isidor the night of the murder. He followed your father through the steppe at night. They were seen together. His story doesn't add up.\nIs that enough? I'm not an investigator, I'm the head of my house! And in these strange, strange times, the governor of this mad circus.
6192355000468253 So, who is the investigator?
6192355000468254 So, as the head, what will you do with him?
6192355000468264 You work fast. Another one, already? Just as guilty as the first?
6192355000468265 Who knows. Maybe you can find out?
6192355000468266 Probably not. But I would like to speak with him.
6192355000468267 What did you want to talk about?
6192355000468433 Something's still not right in The Rod. I should check on Alexander.
6192355000469967 Our theatre has seen better days. The repertory is getting stale. Same play, over and over again. It's beginning to get on my nerves.
6192355000472251 Friend

6192355000472454 
6192355000472455 The bull will be sacrificed at the Ragi Barrow in the evening. I think six is the right time.
6192355000474551 ???
6192355000474951 Clock Puncher
6192355000475551 That's all right. It'll be more fun soon.
6192355000481851 
6192355000481852 
6192355000481853 Saburov seized Father's murderer!
6192355000481854 
6192355000481855 
6192355000481856 The steppe man did not kill Father. He hasn't done anything wrong at all.
6192355000481857 The steppe man informed the people who did not need to know of Father's actions. But he's no killer.
6192355000481858 
6192355000481859 
6192355000481860 Saburov… seized Father's murderer again? Sounds dubious.
6192355000481861 
6192355000481862 
6192355000481863 That man is not a murderer. Curiously, his evidence suggests Simon Kain knew that Father was doomed beforehand.
6192355000481864 
6192355000481865 
6192355000481866 Who murdered Father? I still have no idea. There's only one thing I can tell for certain: Saburov knows even less.\n\nI can't rely on him in my search.
6192355000481867 
6192355000481868 
6192355000481869 Among other things, Father left me a list. Apart from seven kids, there was an eighth name there. "Udurgh." Who or what is it?
6192355000481870 Apart from the seven kids, there was an eighth on the list: "Udurgh." An udurgh, perhaps? Who or what is it? I suspect I will one day have to find out.
6192355000481871 
6192355000481872 Apart from the seven kids, there was an eighth on the list: "Udurgh." An udurgh, perhaps? Who or what is it? \n\nI suspect I will one day have to find out.
6192355000481873 
6192355000481874 
6192355000481875 The patients on my list are under threat.
6192355000481876 
6192355000481877 
6192355000481878 
6192355000481879 
6192355000481880 
6192355000481881 Notkin is infected.\n\n…Shouldn't he have been "in danger" first? It's breaking its own rules!
6192355000481882 
6192355000481883 
6192355000481884 The sand pest threatens the kids, but it's not them it wants. It wants the Eighth, the udurgh. And I can't protect it if I don't figure out what it is!
6192355000481885 
6192355000481886 
6192355000481887 Aspity might know who or what an udurgh is. She's well-versed in the steppe lore.
6192355000481888 Aspity doesn't know for certain what "udurgh" means. But perhaps I can extract more out of her?
6192355000481889 
6192355000481890 
6192355000481891 Rubin… He spent a lot of time with Father. Perhaps he's heard of this "udurgh"?
6192355000481892 
6192355000481893 
6192355000481894 Udurgh is a living thing.
6192355000481895 
6192355000481896 
6192355000481897 Rubin doesn't know jackshit. But he gave me an idea: Olgimsky's son studies steppe lore. Perhaps I could ask him?
6192355000481898 
6192355000481899 
6192355000481900 This "udurgh" is elusive. Many know the word, but few grasp the full meaning. \n\nForeman Oyun could explain it to me… but he's locked up with the rest of the Termitary.
6192355000481901 
6192355000481902 
6192355000481903 The udurgh's ear is in an abandoned steppe village—whatever that means. It's quiet for now. I need to wait.
6192355000482251 Infected Blood
6192355000482252 Can be used like any other infected organ.
6192355000483593 What d'ya want, man?
6192355000483594 Do you know what Stakh Rubin's been up to? He's kept me in the dark.
6192355000483595 What? Are you busy with something? I can't tell.
6192355000483596 Then that's the way he wants it, isn't it? Why would I give you a lantern?
6192355000483597 Have you seen him?
6192355000483598 Of course I am. I'm ruminatin'. What's that, if not work?
6192355000483599 I'm working too, then. Have you seen Rubin?
6192355000483600 Ha. I'd pay good coin to never see him, but I can't help but bump into the man… Neighbors share labors, as the sayin' goes.
6192355000483601 Did he join your gang? That's… unexpected.
6192355000483602 Screw your head back on, will you? You're shortin' out. We'd recruit a pig and all her piglets before we ever considered Rubin.\nHe just needed a hideout. And who'd help the poor sod but me? We're friends, after all.
6192355000483603 And where would that hideout be?
6192355000483604 Won't tell you. I promised to not sell him out, so I won't. Go look for it yourself. I've said enough.
6192355000483605 Yes. You have said enough. Thanks.
6192355000483606 If you're bumping into each other, he must be close.
6192355000483607 Fair enough. I'll find him on my own.
6192355000483608 Did he run into trouble?
6192355000483609 I'd like to know that, too. But he's a man with a code, like you. Doesn't trust me. Probably pains him to stoop to my level.\nDoesn't bother me. I'm not proud.
6192355000483610 You mentioned you weren't seeing each other often, right?
6192355000483611 You're neighbors now? So he hides out at the Warehouses?
6192355000491651 
6192355000491652 
6192355000491653 Stakh Rubin is doing something shady at night. Where could he be?\n\nOh, Stakh… Still, he's a friend. I have a bad feeling. Better hurry.
6192355000492451 
6192355000492452 
6192355000492453 So Rubin's not at home either. Not unexpected.\n\nGuess I'll have to ask the sly one, supposedly aware of everyone's comings and goings…
6192355000492454 
6192355000492455 
6192355000492456 Rubin operates in the Warehouses. That's all I know. A needle in a haystack… but perhaps there's some sort of trace?
6192355000492457 
6192355000492458 
6192355000492459 
6192355000492651 ???
6192355000493175 I'd like to trade with you, for my conscience's sake. But no one will trade with thieves or murderers. Barter is about trust.
6192355000493176 I'm neither thief nor murderer, pal. You'd do well to remember that.
6192355000493177 How fares your kine, Khatangher?
6192355000493178 Poorly.
6192355000493179 So relieved they brought fresh water from the springs. Otherwise, we'd have to drink from the Gorkhon.
6192355000493180 Have you lost it? You see the Abattoir over there? Guess where all its waste gets dumped.
6192355000493181 One and two and one and two,\nSteppe has gotten into you.\nWho breathes air in the fall,\nDies before he sees it all.
6192355000493182 But I like breathing.
6192355000493183 Hey, big fella… On your way here, did you hear anything? Like a train?
6192355000493184 What train?
6192355000493185 Do you still have a name?
6192355000493186 Same as you, I believe.
6192355000493187 A murderer walks the streets. Human or shabnak, who knows… But our kids are outside, too. Won't stay home no matter what we tell them!
6192355000493188 Why can't you just ground them?
6192355000493189 What does conscience have to do with it?
6192355000493190 Pah! "Trust." You're superstitious. I remember this attitude growing up.
6192355000493191 Barter is a sacred tradition. You understand that it's not about objects at all, don't you?
6192355000493192 Not about objects? Would you like to trade your coat for a match, then?
6192355000493193 I might have accepted that offer. But I won't trade with a man who has a burdened conscience. Why poison my own fate?
6192355000493194 There is no fate. We make our own lives.
6192355000493195 Nothing sacred about it… It's just old.
6192355000493196 Don't worry. You won't.
6192355000493197 A clear conscience is important… but even if I have sinned, it's not contagious. So mind your own soul, pal.
6192355000493198 You're weird. <i>Your</i> fate won't improve my life, only my own trust. Get it? When I trust someone, I get lucky, so good things come my way.
6192355000493199 Fair enough. I guess I didn't think about it.
6192355000493200 Fine. I'll clear my good name soon. Then we can barter.
6192355000493201 Trust is about forgiving your enemies, and seeing the good in them.
6192355000493202 Bayarlaa. How fares your kine?
6192355000493203 Finally! Someone who doesn't treat me like a villain.
6192355000493204 We, the Khatanghe, must help each other out. You are our Kin. \nYou shouldn't get into fights, tangher. You'll always lose, no matter who remains standing.
6192355000493205 How come?
6192355000493206 Think, tangher. If they kill you, then it's very bad, right? But if <i>you</i> kill <i>them,</i> it's still bad. Everyone will hate you. Won't let you in, sell you food, or barter. You'll be hunted. Do you need a wolf's life?
6192355000493207 Damned if you do, damned if you don't…
6192355000493208 I'd rather lose standing.
6192355000493209 But they don't treat each other that way!
6192355000493210 We are the Kin. They dislike us.
6192355000493211 I'm a halfbreed. I only have steppe blood on my father's side.
6192355000493212 Don't get into fights, unente. Clear up your name first. As time passes, people will accept you. Then do as you please.
6192355000493213 Sounds tempting.
6192355000493214 True. We are the Kin.
6192355000493215 I don't identify as one of you.
6192355000493216 Bayarlaa. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.
6192355000493217 Nice poem. You write that yourself?
6192355000493218 Guess a bear like you can breathe some and be fine. But only some.
6192355000493219 A bear, huh? Friends used to call me Cub when we were kids. But back then, it was ironic.
6192355000493220 If only! I'll never be that good.\nWhen'd you last sleep? The circles around your eyes, the wheezing… Just observing facts. Are you an outsider?
6192355000493221 I'm a local. Just been away for a while.
6192355000493222 I just arrived.
6192355000493223 I'm not one to turn down small favors.
6192355000493224 Mom says that while twyre, chickenpox, crowberry, swish, and joy all bloom, you have to sleep every five hours. Or your head will explode!
6192355000493225 You're thinking of a stroke.
6192355000493226 No explosions, but our brains do get less oxygen in the fall around here.
6192355000493227 Your mom is right.
6192355000493228 She seems to be an expert on local herbs.
6192355000493229 Huh? Are you a doctor or something? I hate doctors. Mom says all doctors are slackers and frauds, even Old Burakh.
6192355000493230 Yes. I'm a doctor.
6192355000493231 I'm a surgeon. Ever considered having your tongue removed?
6192355000493232 Gorkhon water will turn you into livestock. Saw it with my own eyes.
6192355000493233 You have no sense of humor, tenegh. Who'd drink from the Gorkhon? Even blood would be better. So, fresh spring water is good news.\nBut I wonder how long it will last…
6192355000493234 What about water bearers? Have they left for more?
6192355000493235 It used to last for quite a while. Did something change?
6192355000493236 Fat Vlad used to manage the water bearers. Now, it's his son.\nThe father is cruel, but he knows his business. The son is kinder, but useless. He'll certainly mess everything up.
6192355000493237 Why?
6192355000493238 What use are kind people? We aren't kind. We deserve no kindness.
6192355000493239 You're not cruel… Just bitter.
6192355000493240 True.
6192355000493241 Why do you think he's useless?
6192355000493242 Vlad the Younger manages the water bearers now, but he's a simpleton. I've even heard rumors he might be digging a well… \nSurely false, of course. Even someone completely incompetent wouldn't do that.
6192355000493243 Indeed. I doubt anyone in this town would be that reckless.
6192355000493244 Just superstition. I also believed it, for a while, but not anymore.
6192355000493245 No, I haven't heard anything.
6192355000493246 Oh, an outsider. So! We send meat and skins to the outside world, and they send back a big ol' train of provisions, mostly stuff we can't make.\nDad says it's like living out at sea, on a faraway island.
6192355000493247 Yeah, I'm a local. I already know all this.
6192355000493248 Does your dad work at the Factory? The skinnery or the cannery?
6192355000493249 Wha—? No, my dad's a postman! If he worked at the Factory, phew… I wouldn't be here at all! 'Cause mom would've had an abortion!
6192355000493250 Hey! Aren't you too young to talk about that kind of stuff?
6192355000493551 
6192355000493552 
6192355000493553 
6192355000493554 It's time to see if Rubin is done with his shady business.
6192355000493555 
6192355000493556 
6192355000493557 
6192355000493558 
6192355000493559 
6192355000493560 The Kin will only leave Rubin alone when he "rots on his own." There's nothing I can do about it.
6192355000493561 
6192355000493562 
6192355000493563 
6192355000493564 
6192355000493565 
6192355000493566 
6192355000493567 There was no udurgh in the old village, but I found strange blood there. I wonder what happens if I mix it with a tincture?
6192355000493568 
6192355000493569 
6192355000493570 I vouched for Rubin to an Elder.
6192355000493571 
6192355000493572 
6192355000493573 The mysterious blood produced a vial of liquid. Now I need to test it on someone infected.
6192355000493574 
6192355000493575 
6192355000493576 It was all worth it. I made the serum. The panacea. My concoction cures the plague completely.
6192355000495151 Why? She says it herself when she sees Uncle Bertie.
6192355000495152 Sure, the life of a factory worker isn't exactly blessed…
6192355000495153 The train is already two weeks late. We might very well starve soon. Like, we've almost run out of sweets. Uta bartered away all her buttons for a lump of sugar yesterday! Unbelievable!
6192355000495154 Two weeks? That's a long time, actually…
6192355000495155 Unbelievable, indeed. I'd keep my buttons.
6192355000495156 Beats unemployment.
6192355000495157 And you walk around repeating it? Have some tact.
6192355000495159 What do you mean, "still"? It will remain with me even as I die.
6192355000495160 Father threw his out. He's faceless, now. Makes me kinda sad.
6192355000495161 Why did he do that?
6192355000495162 I bet it does!
6192355000495163 Cheer up. Faces and names are only fiction.
6192355000495164 Guess he did something bad… I wonder what.
6192355000495165 Or something good. That's how it usually goes.
6192355000495166 I don't think knowing would do you any good.
6192355000495167 But I'm curious. I would hate to lose my name.
6192355000495168 …And your face, yes? Cheer up. It'll be fine.
6192355000495169 Really? Do you know for sure? 'Cause he can't tell now.
6192355000495170 Of course. He understood something very important.
6192355000495171 Same here.
6192355000495172 You just… don't stop loving him.
6192355000495173 So what? Fate will get you anywhere.
6192355000495174 Fate! Why do I care if it's fate or not if illness befalls me? Who said each person only has one, single fate?
6192355000495175 I didn't. Perhaps we have several.
6192355000495176 But they do.
6192355000495177 Everything's terrible… It all started with that awful tower. There's nothing we can do, now. Kids do whatever they damn well please. \nCan't say anything to them… I mean that. Try, and the words stick in your throat. They've become complete strangers to us. But what about common blood, I ask you? What about paternal love?
6192355000495178 You're sure there's nothing to be done?
6192355000495179 What does this have to do with the Tower?
6192355000495180 Hard to explain… The Tower crushes us. Try to speak a word against it, and it's as if an invisible blade slices your vocal cords.\nIt did something to our kids. Like they're crossing a river over thin ice, and you can't follow, only call after them.
6192355000495181 They'll return, and the ice will become thicker.
6192355000495182 Because they belong to that damned tower now.
6192355000495183 What is it, anyway?
6192355000495184 Eh, it's natural. When I was a kid, I also preferred to be outside.
6192355000495185 Do you know who built it?
6192355000495186 The Kains, of course, let the fires of hell take them. Who else? If only the Saburovs ruled this town by themselves, it'd be such a nice place…
6192355000495187 Oh… Makes sense now.
6192355000495188 Don't worry about the kids. They're smarter than us.
6192355000495189 How many children do you have?
6192355000495190 Me? Two younger brothers. Twelve and fifteen. Both in the Tower.
6192355000495191 Let them play.
6192355000495192 Living in their own world could be good for them.
6192355000495193 Nothing a few lashes with a belt wouldn't fix.
6192355000495251 
6192355000495252 
6192355000495292 ???
6192355000500152 
6192355000500208 
6192355000500209 
6192355000500229 My respects to you, esegher. You looking for him, too?\nHe has not come yet. Sly.
6192355000500230 Why are you looking for him?
6192355000500231 What's he so afraid of?
6192355000500232 So he hasn't been home for a while?
6192355000500233 This is our third night of waiting.
6192355000500234 Why are you so persistent?
6192355000500235 Elders say he's wronged us grievously. Elders say many Khatanghe will die for his misdeeds.
6192355000500236 What has he done?
6192355000500237 Why?
6192355000500238 A bull knows when olonngo is near. He doesn't want to go in. Pushes back.
6192355000500239 Come on. How did he wrong you?
6192355000500240 Olonngo? Oh, right. "A ford." Your name for the Abattoir.
6192355000500241 Who knows? Who cares? Elders say, and we obey. What is there to think about? Why think without reason? Too soon to think.
6192355000500242 Father was <i>so</i> right to send me away from here.
6192355000500243 Indeed. Thinking is hard.
6192355000500244 Go away. Clearly he knows you've laid your ambush here.
6192355000501051 Yes! It works!
6192355000503651 Stakh Rubin
6192355000504651 Executor
6192355000504652 Well, Burakh, you're nearly dead. Got a few minutes left. I'm here to announce your demise.
6192355000504653 Can't do much on such short notice.
6192355000504654 Are you with that… crowd?
6192355000504655 How do you know my name?
6192355000504656 I know everything. Part of the unfortunate job. I've got your whole journey laid out here.
6192355000504657 And what sort of journey is it going to be?
6192355000504658 Of course I'm not. They were just peaceful townsfolk. Craftsmen, factory workers, good sons and fathers… but me, I'm much more dangerous. I'm the Mask of Fate.
6192355000504659 Peaceful? Yeah right. Why did they try to kill me?
6192355000504660 And what's my fate?
6192355000504661 It's not pretty, Burakh.
6192355000504662 Really? Why?
6192355000504663 My esteemed colleague will explain.
6192355000504664 So what did you want to tell me?
6192355000504665 You've been bashed on the head several times, and the locals' fists are heavy. And one of those four stab wounds looks deep. Significant blood loss, too, and the local climate is unforgiving in terms of strain. \nDo you have any heart conditions?
6192355000504666 None.
6192355000504667 Ha.
6192355000504668 My heart's too soft.
6192355000504669 Your health is a mess. I'm guessing you haven't eaten in several days, and that you didn't sleep last night… Did you? That's what I thought. So your hunger and exhaustion are critical, too. I wonder which of these afflictions will be the death of you first… \nSo what's your plan?
6192355000504670 Any good advice?
6192355000504671 If I'm going to die, so be it.
6192355000504672 Aw, fatalism looks cute on you. Better not to make proclamations like that without gritting your teeth. \nProblem is, your teeth have almost been knocked out, so clenching your jaw is hard. Fatalism's much more fun when you've got options, isn't it?
6192355000504673 Maybe.
6192355000504674 I'm done with you. Piss off.
6192355000504675 Dressing your wounds would be a good idea.
6192355000504676 Where would I get bandages?
6192355000504677 Thanks, beakhead. But the doggy over there helped me already.
6192355000504678 What doggy, Burakh? Are you hallucinating already? There aren't any dogs here.
6192355000504679 I could use more bandages, though, if I knew where to get them.
6192355000504680 A drugstore, Burakh! You've been studying surgery for six years and you're just finding this out now? \nBut it's not just about the wounds. Even when they're dressed, you still need to be aware of your body. It's not always on your side. Pay attention to its needs.
6192355000504681 I'll figure it out. What next?
6192355000504682 Thanks. I'll keep you in mind if I need to learn more about human anatomy.
6192355000504683 Next you die anyway, because the whole town will soon have it out for you. And it's got nothing to do with the three poor souls you've just done in.
6192355000504684 Great. Why do they hate me?
6192355000504685 My colleague over there can explain it better. That's his role. Mine is teaching you how your body works, so you don't die <i>before</i> you make it home.
6192355000504686 Fair enough. Forewarned, forearmed.
6192355000504687 I don't need it. I'm a doctor, remember?
6192355000504688 [a long, but useful conversation about survival in this unfriendly world]
6192355000504689 [a conversation worth having]
6192355000504690 [i don't have time for long talks]
6192355000504691 Wait just a second. A short warning here. You can, of course, rely on telepathy to skip a conversation. But do keep in mind that you will never be able to return to it again. Ever.
6192355000504692 Wow, a talking bird! One more caw please.
6192355000504693 Got it. Now shoo.
6192355000504694 You don't have to mince words. Be my guest, cover your ears, sing la la la—it will all end soon, anyway. Even a conversation skipped will leave… crumbs of meaning in your mind.\nYou'll still be able to limp to the next plot point. But you'll reach the destination with a head just as empty as it is now.
6192355000504695 All right, fine. You've got three minutes. What did you want to tell me?
6192355000504696 [and this is where this conversation ends]
6192355000504697 Persistent, huh? Good. Maybe you'll even survive a day or two this way.
6192355000504698 Got a bite? Birdseed's fine.
6192355000504699 I was on my way to talk to your colleague. Mixed you two up. You're sort of similar.
6192355000504700 Food is sold in shops. Though your reputation might prevent you from a warm welcome. \nBut there's a meat warehouse nearby that was conveniently broken into recently. The perpetrators walked down the railroad tracks. There, ahead and to the right. Think you can catch up to them?
6192355000504701 Not sure. To be honest, I'm dead tired.
6192355000504702 Yes. The railroad track that goes through the Warehouses is just a stone's throw away.
6192355000504703 You can sleep at someone's place… if they like you enough. I doubt there's anyone like that around, though… People have forgotten you.\nYou do have your own house, I suppose. Do you remember where it is?
6192355000504704 Of course.
6192355000504705 Actually, I could use a map.
6192355000504706 Thanks, I know that already.
6192355000504707 Godspeed, Burakh. Though I doubt it'll be easy, God's presence or not.
6192355000504708 Easy isn't my style, anyway.
6192355000504709 Any useful advice, then?
6192355000504710 Be careful. Be stealthy. People are scared out of their minds now, and quick to attack. Trust no one. Speak to my esteemed colleague over there. He wants a word with you.
6192355000504711 All right.
6192355000504712 I already have. You're both useless.
6192355000504713 I'll manage without his wisdom, I'm sure.
6192355000504714 Welcome back home, Warden. You've been away a while. You probably don't even remember the heady scent of twyre in the air… Do you know why you got attacked?
6192355000504715 No clue.
6192355000504716 I'm not a warden to anyone, much less to an irritating bird.
6192355000504717 Rude. Do you think it's smart to get cheeky at me? Don't spit into the wind, as the saying goes.\n"Wardens," Burakh, are your family's role in the local steppe Kin. You <i>are</i> a steppe man, aren't you?
6192355000504718 Half. My father is a steppe man.
6192355000504719 It's an old tradition. No one remembers it anymore.
6192355000504720 And that's your business how?
6192355000504721 Your father does.
6192355000504722 Father is the sort of person who remembers everything.
6192355000504723 Yeah. The locals respect him a lot.
6192355000504724 Indeed. Old Isidor Burakh is the exemplar of a true doctor—and a true human being, if a miserable one. Do you honor your father?
6192355000504725 I do.
6192355000504726 We're done here. I won't discuss my father with you.
6192355000504727 He's the reason I returned. He summoned me… with a letter. Said there was a threat. Do you know anything about it?
6192355000504728 The whole Town is looking for a murderer. A very important and respected man was killed last night. The townsfolk loved him better than some children love their fathers. Don't be too hard on them.
6192355000504729 Should I feel bad for them? Say sorry, maybe?
6192355000504730 What does that have to do with me?
6192355000504731 Who was killed?
6192355000504732 Maybe you should. Your father would. A brilliant doctor. Far better than us.
6192355000504733 I know.
6192355000504734 Oh, we're colleagues, now?
6192355000504735 Eh. I'm more of a manager, really. But I'm in the field. And we've done a lot of business with your father.
6192355000504736 Well, Father and I practice, unlike you. So don't pigeonhole us together.
6192355000504737 Leave my father alone. What do you want with me?
6192355000504738 Whatever. That bit's not important. Time is short. Oh, by the way, Burakh… Time is important. Be careful how you spend it. And be aware that you don't have much left.
6192355000504739 How much?
6192355000504740 I know. A few more minutes. Your colleague already told me.
6192355000504741 You knew the victim—less than you thought, but more than most. Don't worry, you'll learn more soon. But I, personally, can't divulge this sort of information. Investigator's privilege.
6192355000504742 So you're an investigator?
6192355000504743 Aren't we all? Everyone lies, so you can only get to the bottom of things by using your brain. That's what your father used to say. It's an actual quote from him, by the way, because I happen to know him. And we got even better acquainted today. How about you? Did you two argue much? 
6192355000504744 Never.
6192355000504745 Why do you care so much, bird?
6192355000504746 You know him? Unlikely. He hates people who hide their faces.
6192355000504747 Nothing's a threat to him anymore, trust me. Maybe dishonor. But even that's unlikely. You're a man of obligation, after all, aren't you?
6192355000504748 I am.
6192355000504749 Runs in the family. Why?
6192355000504750 No dishonor will come to him for any reason.
6192355000505151 Well… a little more.
6192355000505152 I intend to live to eighty, no less. We're a long-lived family.
6192355000505153 You've got less than two weeks, Burakh. Twelve or so days. Trust me, I'm a… specialist. So use your time well. And hurry home now. Why are you wasting your time here? Your father's waiting.
6192355000505154 I'm a picture of good health. Trust <i>me,</i> I'm the doctor here.
6192355000505155 I should hurry home, that's true. That's why I returned to town, after all.
6192355000505156 I don't like you much, beakhead.
6192355000505157 You've just got <i>that</i> sort of face. Suspicious. Unfamiliar. Menacing…
6192355000505158 My face is perfectly normal, thanks.
6192355000505159 But I'm a local. I'm from here.
6192355000505160 [a conversation about your recent past and likely future]
6192355000505161 [i'd like to know that]
6192355000505162 [i'll figure it out myself]
6192355000505163 Wait just a second. A short warning here. You can, of course, rely on telepathy to skip a conversation. But do keep in mind that you will never be able to return to it again. Ever.
6192355000505164 Wow, a talking bird! One more caw please.
6192355000505165 Got it. Now shoo.
6192355000505166 You don't have to mince words. Be my guest, cover your ears, sing la la la—it will all end soon, anyway. Even a conversation skipped will leave… crumbs of meaning in your mind.\nYou'll still be able to limp to the next plot point. But you'll reach the destination with a head just as empty as it is now.
6192355000505167 All right, fine. You've got three minutes. What did you want to tell me?
6192355000505168 [and this is where this conversation ends]
6192355000505551 
6192355000505607 
6192355000505619 Why did you come, kholboön? There's enough of us here already. We begin soon.\nOr do you want to protect your friend? He's dead already. Can't be changed.
6192355000505620 Perhaps I do want to protect him.
6192355000505621 Can't <i>anything</i> be done about this?
6192355000505622 The heart of the Kin has made up its mind, so this is how it will be. If you kill us, others will come. If not today, tomorrow.\nYou cannot save your friend. He's ubshe. A dead man.
6192355000505623 "The heart"... you choose pretty words. I know a word or two as well. Who is in charge of all this? Whom do I need to talk to for you to leave Stakh alone?
6192355000505624 You pitiless beasts… At times like this, I'm ashamed to be a Khatangher myself.
6192355000505625 No one. There are no ones. Only the Whole. The People. The Kin. The Khatangher. It shares a heartbeat, a sense. It decides nothing. It acts.\nYour friend is a thorn in our heart. If you truly want to help him, pray to Stepmother Suok, kiss Earth. Pray for the thorn to rot on its own. Then there'll be no need to extract it.
6192355000505626 You want me to pray that he dies on his own, sparing you the dirty work? No way in hell.
6192355000505627 I may not protect him from the whole Kin, but I can sure deal with you bunch.
6192355000505628 Khatangher
6192355000505629 Khatangher
6192355000506851 Cub? The heck are you doin' here?
6192355000506852 I was about to ask the same.
6192355000506853 This place is fascinating. A sort of club.
6192355000506854 Just… collecting folklore.
6192355000506855 You heard about Rubin? Know why the Kin wants him dead? He's walkin' around all downcast, doesn't sleep. Says not to ask. Says it's safer like that.\nWhat's he done, I wonder? I wanted to ask Sahba, but maybe you know?
6192355000506856 Rubin is in danger? What makes you think so?
6192355000506857 You're lying. That's not what you wanted to ask. I can tell.
6192355000506858 I don't know. Guess he's overworked.
6192355000506859 She's dead. Go home.
6192355000506860 If I did lie, I wouldn't tell you the truth now anyway, would I? So back off.\nLike your people say: "Who can pierce the nature of things better than a yargachin butcher? Only a yargachin idiot."
6192355000506861 Who told you that Rubin's in trouble?
6192355000506862 "Yargachin" means "butcher." Stop flaunting your ignorance.
6192355000506863 I check up on him. We're neighbors now, after all. It was me who granted him his new den.
6192355000506864 Huh… I see. Well, I'll check up on him too, then.
6192355000506865 Where? Show me.
6192355000506866 Already told you too much. This business is between me and Rubin, not you. He wanted secrecy, he got it. Makin' an exception for Artemy? Nah.
6192355000506867 That's all right. The Warehouses aren't endless. I'll find him.
6192355000506868 All right, all right. Consider the secrecy maintained.
6192355000507251 Bad Grief
6192355000507252 Messenger
6192355000507253 Governor Saburov is calling for you. It's urgent.
6192355000507254 What's the matter?
6192355000507255 Urgent. Always is.
6192355000507256 It appears your father's killer has been found. The interrogation is held at the Rod.
6192355000507257 I'll be there. Go. Warn everyone I'm coming.
6192355000507258 Found again? They've found one before. Me.
6192355000507265 
6192355000507278 Suspect
6192355000507304 I know you, yargachin. May Mother Boddho caress your step. \nYou're my salvation. You know the Lines and can tell lies from truth. Look into my eyes. I did not kill your father.
6192355000507305 Why were you taken?
6192355000507306 Talk to me. Don't hold anything back. What happened that night?
6192355000507307 For a good reason.
6192355000507308 How so?
6192355000507309 A good reason? And yet you didn't kill my father?
6192355000507310 Here is how. I betrayed your father. I am guilty of that. I may even be responsible for his death.\nBut it was from ignorance! Boddho is my witness—I wished him no harm!
6192355000507311 Tell me.
6192355000507312 Wished none, but did some, huh?
6192355000507313 On the eve of their deaths, your father and Simon Kain went out into the steppe. They dug a hole. In secret.\nI witnessed this and told Tycheek, the Termitary overseer. I should have gone to Foreman Oyun, of course… He was a friend to your father.
6192355000507314 So what happened next?
6192355000507315 What makes you think going to Foreman Oyun would have been better?
6192355000507316 And what of it? You told Tycheek. So what?
6192355000507317 What does Simon Kain have to do with this?
6192355000507318 Digging a hole is… well, you understand. You wouldn't hack at your mother's breast, would you?
6192355000507319 I would if it were necessary to cure her.
6192355000507320 What happened then?
6192355000507321 They were friends. Oyun would have gone to your father and resolved the problem face-to-face, in private, to avoid trouble. But Tycheek… he flew into a rage. Remember how he never had much love for your father?
6192355000507322 I don't. What next?
6192355000507323 I do. Go on.
6192355000507324 Do you know the Lines? Perhaps not, but your father did. I don't believe he meant evil, but the elders… they ran after them, into the steppe.\nThat's what I did, yargachin. You may judge me now.
6192355000507325 And that's all? That's not a betrayal.
6192355000507326 And you never saw my father again that night?
6192355000507327 No.
6192355000507328 Well, then, there's nothing to judge here.
6192355000507329 So you blame Tycheek?
6192355000507330 It is betrayal.
6192355000507331 Judge yourself. But I don't blame you.
6192355000507332 Perhaps. But I don't need a traitor. I need a murderer.
6192355000507333 No, I don't. He returned to the Termitary immediately, and then the place was locked.  No one knows what goes on there now. There's talk of an uprising…
6192355000507334 An uprising? Why?
6192355000507336 I don't know.
6192355000507337 So what's your sin?
6192355000507338 You aren't guilty of anything.
6192355000507339 No, I'm guilty of something else. Guilty towards Isidor, too.
6192355000507340 How can that be?
6192355000507341 He has no part in this. He died before your father. True, it was on the same night, but it happened much, much earlier.
6192355000507342 I don't understand.
6192355000507343 And what does Oyun have to do with all this?
6192355000507344 We're working, we're working! It'll be done soon. You'll like it.
6192355000507345 Huh? You're doing something for me?
6192355000507346 The steppe rabble are dragging a bull through the Hindquarters. Celebrating their cruelty, the beasts…
6192355000507347 Yeah? Why are they doing that?

6192355000512253 What's wrong with you?
6192355000512254 You deserve it.
6192355000512255 The sand plague. Keep your distance. And don't blame yourself. Just find your father's real killer, and I can die peacefully.
6192355000512256 I will.
6192355000512257 I will end them. You can be sure of that.
6192355000512258 Perhaps I'll forgive them. What would you say to that?
6192355000512259 You still have time left on this earth. To look your reflection in the eye each morning. How will you manage that?
6192355000512260 I was joking.
6192355000512261 What do you even know?

6192355000514160 Bad Grief's Nest
6192355000514161 Grigory Filin, aka Bad Grief, reigns a small warehouse kingdom these days. He can sell anything under the counter.
6192355000514162 The local authorities often visit the place. But the town jail is in the same building.
6192355000514163 The Lump
6192355000514164 The Olgimskys' mansion. Far Vlad is the owner and master of the Bull Enterprise... but for many it's just "the Master."
6192355000514165 Father is dead. Should I still insist on getting home...?
6192355000514166 I let the traitor go. Not sure if Notkin wants to know or not.
6192355000514167 Something's brewing in a warehouse that belongs to kids.
6192355000514168 Well, I cut out the unneeded part. Let's see what Bad Grief thinks of it.
6192355000514169 Theater
6192355000514170 It hosts a hospital now.
6192355000514171 Rumor has it, a bizarre creature was captured here.
6192355000514172 Something tells me Big Vlad and I have things to discuss.
6192355000514173 Steppe people gather at Aspity's hospice.
6192355000514174 I know a good obstetrician all right... He'll cut whatever needs to be cut. Including railways.
6192355000514175 Olgimsky Jr. wants to see me.
6192355000514176 Vlad Olgimsky wants to see me. A dubious success.
6192355000514177 Town Hall
6192355000514178 Isidor Burakh's House
6192355000514179 
6192355000514180 Something's wrong here.
6192355000514181 One-eyed Var buys and sells human organs.
6192355000514182 Var's Place
6192355000514183 
6192355000514184 Why did Clara tell me that Katerina requires help? She seems fine. Her husband, however...
6192355000514185 
6192355000514186 
6192355000514187 Huzzah! It works!
6192355000514188 Grocery
6192355000514189 Clothes
6192355000514190 Pharmacy
6192355000514751 
6192355000514758 Isidor Burakh's murderer is caught, at last! The real one this time, it seems.
6192355000514759 Where? At the Rod again?
6192355000514760 No. I have a hunch that it's just another false positive.
6192355000514761 Yes. Saburov is home today. It is said that he is desperate… His authority seems to be falling apart.
6192355000514762 It's not a good time.
6192355000514763 Really? Didn't take long.
6192355000516151 
6192355000516152 
6192355000516153 Who are you?
6192355000516154 Who are <i>you?</i>
6192355000516155 I'm his son.
6192355000516156 Son… I can speak to a son. I'll answer to a son.
6192355000516157 You'll answer before the son, and the father, and the holy spirit.
6192355000516158 At the Kin we say, "There's no answer more honest than silence." And silence implies assent, doesn't it?
6192355000516159 I'm innocent.
6192355000516160 Right. Sorry, my mistake. Should I go now?
6192355000516161 There are no innocent men. The primordial sin weighs on us all.
6192355000516162 Give me a break.\nShrike, the militia boss, dragged me in here. He's had it out for me for the past three years.\nYes, I broke into the Kains' place. So? They don't need worldly things—the heavens sustain them. Why should I be treated like a murderer?
6192355000516163 The Kains? What do they have to do with this?
6192355000516164 You broke into the Kains' place? Great work, very crafty. Did my father go there?
6192355000516165 Well, Simon Kain was old Burakh's pal. That night I saw them parting near the Crucible, a few minutes past midnight.\nYour father told him, "I have three hours left, and you'll probably hold out for a bit longer." He must have known what fate awaited him.
6192355000516166 What do you mean?
6192355000516167 He knew who was going to murder him?
6192355000516168 Look, this whole mess is none of my business. But your father knew that he had three hours left to live. I ended up talking about it once when I'd had too much to drink, embellished a few things, and that's when Shrike took me in.\nBoth of them were gone on that night. Both your father and Simon Kain.
6192355000516169 So who killed them?
6192355000516170 Hell if I know. But it sure wasn't me. I was just passing by and overheard them talking, right? They sounded like they'd planned it all from the start. Get it?
6192355000516171 I do.
6192355000516172 No, I don't.
6192355000516173 That's what I'm talking about.
6192355000516174 Why?
6192355000516175 True, it doesn't sound like they were talking about murder. More like… both of them decided to die.\nOr maybe… I don't know, maybe there was poison in their blood and they only had a little time left to live.
6192355000516176 Poison?
6192355000516177 How do you figure that?
6192355000516218 I'm dying.
6192355000516219 What's wrong with you?
6192355000516220 You deserve it.
6192355000516221 The sand plague. Keep your distance. And don't blame yourself. Just find your father's real killer, and I can die peacefully.
6192355000516222 I will.
6192355000516223 I will end them. You can be sure of that.
6192355000516224 Perhaps I'll forgive them. What would you say to that?
6192355000516225 You still have time left on this earth. To look your reflection in the eye each morning. How will you manage that?
6192355000516226 I was joking.
6192355000516227 What do you even know?
6192355000517753 Unente, akhar. Here you are. Finally.
6192355000517754 How fares your kine, Khatangher? What did you want of me?
6192355000517799 Why'd you wait here? You could find me in the Town. I'm not hiding.
6192355000517800 …Who are you, Kindred? Do you remember anything of us? Can you feel your roots?
6192355000517801 I can.
6192355000517802 "Akhar" implies we're unequal. I don't like this.
6192355000517803 A terrible tragedy. Many die…\nI've seen this disease before. Your father did everything right. I'd give my honor and my life to not let it happen again. But since it already has, let us take advantage of this tragedy.\nLet us revive the Kin. You will do it, not me. And you are to rule it.
6192355000517804 "Take advantage"? What are you talking about, tangher?
6192355000517805 Our people withered by the year, so that the Town grew. It was built on our bones.\nNow it's the other way around. The Town withers, our people endure. It's time to revive the Kin.
6192355000517806 If only Father could hear you.
6192355000517807 I have information about your father—the how and why of his death. But that is a long conversation, and it will only happen when you act.\nGo to the Warrens. Kill the guards. Get inside.
6192355000517808 To the Termitary? What for?
6192355000517809 Our elders are a single, many-headed beast. Its single neck is Tycheek, the overseer of the Warrens.\nTell him I've returned. Tell them not to come out. You and I will prepare everything. Let them stay inside until the disease devours the whole Town. Then let them come out.
6192355000517810 You looked for mythical bulls among the steppe. The aurochs. Is that true?
6192355000517811 Rule? Me? I don't deserve the honor.
6192355000517812 True. You don't deserve the honor, akhar. You are no one yet.\nBut you will follow in your father's footsteps, then replace me. I'm already a dead man walking.
6192355000517813 Do you know how Father died?
6192355000517814 Why won't <i>you</i> go, kholboön?
6192355000517815 I tried to get close, but they shot at me. And I can't shoot. They kill on sight. I was wounded. Anyone else would have been killed.\nBut you will find a way in. Do you have a gun?
6192355000517816 Are you dying?
6192355000517817 "Kill." Easy for you to say. Do you think it's that simple?
6192355000517818 I'm a doctor, not a murderer.
6192355000517819 Death is nothing. Don't overvalue human life. People only matter as parts of an udurgh.\nA person is dissolved in "people." A person is dissolved in Earth. As a separate entity, they matter not at all, whether alive or dead.
6192355000517820 How can I help you?
6192355000517821 I was looking for ancient bulls. Odonghe said they'd heard them bellow far off.\nThey were mistaken. I walked the steppe for a long time. There are no more ancient bulls. They're extinct. The Town devoured them, as it devours us now, Khatangher.\nDon't let this loss be in vain. Go to the Warrens.
6192355000517822 I won't kill anyone. I'm not a butcher.
6192355000517823 You are a butcher. He who knows the Lines is a butcher. He who can dissect a great bull is a butcher. He who fears not blood.\nPay your price for your father's authority. It is always paid in blood.
6192355000517825 Don't you have anyone else to send?
6192355000517828 Is that the price I have to pay to learn about Father's last days?
6192355000517829 Yes. There is no other way.
6192355000517830 I'll come back to you with news from Tycheek.
6192355000517831 
6192355000517832 I'm half and half. My roots spread on both sides.
6192355000517833 No. I don't want to pay it.
6192355000517834 This is not my way… akhar.
6192355000517835 …Seven thousand dead, more or less.
6192355000517836 Are they in those sacks?
6192355000517837 Yes. I have not seen so many corpses since the Battle of the Fords.
6192355000517838 Are there survivors?
6192355000517839 Did you… count?
6192355000517840 Can't you hear the screams? There must be. But it hardly matters.
6192355000517841 You… feel sorry for them?
6192355000517842 I should say that I deserve more pity than they do. This is my death sentence, I believe.\nBut, oddly enough, it's them I think about. Even though they're beyond help.
6192355000517843 Have you already figured out what happened?
6192355000517845 A death sentence? Why?
6192355000517846 You were there?
6192355000517847 No. Not during the battle itself. I arrived the next day.
6192355000517848 Are there any survivors here?
6192355000517850 I do. They were bottled up in here by Olgimsky. I will soon find out if he knew about the infection or not.\nWould it be better for the Town if they roamed the streets, seeking food and blood? I doubt it. Would they run off into the steppe and spread infection throughout the country? I wonder.
6192355000518051 Capella's Wing
6192355000518052 The rooms of Victoria Olgimskaya, also known as Capella, are separate from her father's. Children can often be seen scurrying by her wing.
6192355000518053 Strange pantomime shows are performed here every night.
6192355000518054 The Rod
6192355000518055 The mansion of the Saburovs. This part belongs to Alexander, the Town's governor. Many doors are locked in this house.
6192355000518056 Aspity's Hospice
6192355000518057 The steppe people who can't find a better home flock together at Sahba's. Bizarre events occur here, sometimes.
6192355000520251 They wouldn't make it far. Without care, the infection kills within a day.
6192355000520252 I'm an inquisitor. I exist to solve clearly defined problems. If this town survives, so will I.\nThis mission is my last chance to prove my utility. If I fail… Let's just say I am not in good standing at the moment. I expect no lenience.
6192355000520253 Does that mean the Termitary is unlocked, now? Can the survivors come out?
6192355000520254 Curious.\nAlthough, even if the disease had crossed the steppe, technically I would have been beyond reproach. My task was to save the Town. I was never ordered to stop the epidemic.\nAlthough, who cares about formalities in my situation.
6192355000520255 How is it possible?
6192355000520256 How is your situation special?
6192355000520271 My feet ache.
6192355000520272 Feet… Feet are fine. What about the rest of you?
6192355000520273 The important thing is, you're alive, girl from Father's list.
6192355000520274 No. They won't let me out. Even though I'm… I'm superior, and they must listen! But no one does…\nNot enough toys here. Very boring. Is the outside more interesting?
6192355000520275 Just don't be scared when you walk out of this room. Don't look around, and think happy thoughts.

6192355000522677 Grace looks after the dead at the cemetery. This place smells of soil and milk.

6192355000522682 The Abattoir
6192355000522683 Used to be a temple. Now, a giant slaughterhouse. Off limits.
6192355000524851 Fellow Traveler
6192355000524852 Fellow Traveler
6192355000525067 Have we met before?
6192355000525068 No, we haven't.\nThey won't let anyone in to see me! Tell them to let guests in! Or I'll get angry again, like I did yesterday!
6192355000525069 Is that why your feet ache? Were you stomping around a lot?
6192355000525070 Also gums and guts, because I chewed on resin. And… because they won't give me anything tasty anymore. Did you bring anything nice?
6192355000525071 No… I don't have anything nice.
6192355000525072 So what kind of human are you? Why did you come?
6192355000525073 Tell me, kid… Did you ever leave this room? Do you know what's happening outside?
6192355000525074 Like anyone would listen to me here.
6192355000525079 Where will we go? Shekhen, yes? Tell me it's Shekhen! Be khara, what a great idea!
6192355000525080 Why go to Shekhen? It's deserted.
6192355000525081 It's spacious. We'll all find a place there.
6192355000525082 We don't need too much space. I'll take you in.
6192355000525083 And the rest of us, too?
6192355000525084 No. You alone.
6192355000525090 "Hello-ne"? What do you mean? I don't understand the word.
6192355000525091 Well, can you count? How many fingers am I showing to you now?
6192355000525094 Ten.
6192355000525095 No, there's one.
6192355000525096 Yes, it does! It's the same! How can you separate me from Khatanghe, nunehen zaila? You don't cut fingers from a hand! What a stupid idea, <i>helloning</i> someone! Ime beshe, we'll only leave together. \nThen we'll live together. Here, we won't live. It'll be great, yamar goe be!
6192355000525097 What a stubborn kid. Fine. I'll figure something out.
6192355000525098 One tiny kid speaking for all those people… Now I understand what Father meant.
6192355000525099 I came to get you.
6192355000525100 Me?
6192355000525101 Yes. We'll go outside now. Will you come?
6192355000525102 It's… not really. It's dangerous. To be honest, it's bad.
6192355000525103 But I'm brave! Aren't you?
6192355000525104 I have my ups and downs…
6192355000525351 Big Vlad
6192355000525352 Ah, Burakh… You don't have a wife yet, of course… Do you?
6192355000525353 Not yet.
6192355000525354 …And I doubt I ever will.
6192355000525355 Not anymore. But I used to.
6192355000525356 Neither do I… Not anymore.
6192355000525357 Victoria Olgimskaya died a while ago.
6192355000525358 Surprising to find you here, boös.
6192355000525359 Yes.
6192355000525360 I know you loved her. Everyone in the Town knows.
6192355000525361 I'm sorry.
6192355000525362 How did she die, boös Vlad?
6192355000525363 I dropped by to check… if everything's been executed exactly as I instructed. Why did I bother? Of course it was. Like anyone would dare disobey… Like anyone would…
6192355000525364 This is a shop, right?
6192355000525365 What did you order someone to do here?
6192355000525366 They used to sell knick-knacks and mementos here, long ago. That's where I met her. She was buying a brooch… We married the same year. It was fall, too…\nI returned here much later… How long was it? Eight years… They began selling meat. My meat, of course. Brooches… Who needs brooches…
6192355000525367 Indeed. Meat is more important.
6192355000525368 So it was your shop?
6192355000525369 Everything is mine here.
6192355000525370 Undeniably.
6192355000525371 Doesn't look like it. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.
6192355000525372 What should I do, Burakh? Should I repair the shop? Or leave it like this? As a memento, heh heh heh…
6192355000525373 Repair it. Let them sell meat. It's profitable for everyone.
6192355000525374 Let it stay the way it is now. The music is too good.
6192355000525551 Twyrine
6192355000525552 Army Ration
6192355000531251 You come with a heavy heart, esegher.
6192355000531252 Did your people kill Rubin?
6192355000531254 His conscience killed him. He, too, walked around with a heavy heart. So it tore away and slipped from his chest.
6192355000531255 So your people have nothing to do with it?
6192355000531256 Why did he feel so guilty?
6192355000531257 He killed a man. We became the suspects. He knew, but did not come clean. Wanted to stall for time. Did his work while we were being killed for his sin.\nHis conscience finished him off. A decent enough man.
6192355000531258 Are you implying he killed himself? I don't believe it. That's not the kind of man he was.
6192355000531259 Whom did he kill?
6192355000531260 A big man. A strong man. A man who carried a whole world within him. A man who carried our town.\nWhy, do you need a name? Have you not enough worries as it is? You cannot avenge your father, so you grasp at opportunities to avenge a friend, too?
6192355000531261 What have you done to Rubin? Speak, ekhene! You know!
6192355000531262 Our hands never touched him. But eyes can touch. So we looked at him. Made him look at us. Made his conscience eat him, from the inside.
6192355000531263 Touched him with your eyes, huh?
6192355000531264 I don't want to avenge anyone… We need to care for the living, first. The dead will wait.
6192355000531265 Were you the one who organized this? Or were your elders?
6192355000531266 You can do that, too. Have you not tried?
6192355000531267 You're a merciless woman, Sahba. No forgiveness?
6192355000531268 I prefer manual labor.
6192355000531269 What does it have to do with me? We, Khatanghe, feel everything together. We hold no council. We give no orders.\nThe elders listen, the Kin acts. Shekhen wakes up again. Have you heard of the old village?
6192355000531270 I have. Was Rubin's fate decided there?
6192355000531271 The Ear, yes. I've been there.
6192355000531272 Everything is decided there. The soil there is thin, so one can hear everything.\nUnderstand, esegher, that only in your world do people decide who lives and who dies. Think so highly of themselves. We do not think, we listen. Everything happens on its own.
6192355000531273 If that was true, you'd still be walking on all fours.
6192355000531274 You're in too much of a hurry to call me that. I am not your father.
6192355000531275 Consider a flock of birds. Birds give no advice, no speeches. They take wing all at once and go where they need. For they know how to listen. They know not the concept of self. They fear death not.\nYou'll become like that, too. All who come to Shekhen understand.
6192355000531276 I won't. I'm different.
6192355000531277 Perhaps later, when I am smarter.
6192355000531278 That place is a ruin. It offers no understanding.
6192355000531279 You come with a heavy heart, esegher.
6192355000531280 Did your people kill Rubin?
6192355000531282 Rubin died of his conscience. He, too, walked around with a heavy heart. So it tore away and slipped from his chest.
6192355000531283 So your people have nothing to do with it?
6192355000531284 Why did he feel so guilty?
6192355000531285 He killed a man. We became the suspects. He knew, but did not come clean. Wanted to stall for time. Did his work while we were being killed for his sin.\nHis conscience finished him off. A decent enough man.
6192355000531286 Are you implying he killed himself? I don't believe it. That's not the kind of man he was.
6192355000531287 Whom did he kill?
6192355000531288 A big man. A strong man. A man who carried a whole world within him. A man who carried our town.\nWhy, do you need a name? Have you not enough worries as it is? You cannot avenge your father, so you grasp at opportunities to avenge a friend, too?
6192355000531289 What have you done to Rubin?
6192355000531290 I don't want to avenge anyone… We need to care for the living, first. The dead will wait.
6192355000531291 Our hands never touched him. But eyes can touch. So we looked at him. Made him look at us. Made his conscience eat him, from the inside.
6192355000531292 Touched him with your eyes, huh?
6192355000531293 Who organized this? Your elders?
6192355000531294 You can do that, too. Have you not tried?
6192355000531295 Do you know no forgiveness?
6192355000531296 I prefer manual labor.
6192355000531297 We, Khatanghe, feel everything together. We hold no council. We give no orders.\nThe elders listen, the Kin acts. Shekhen wakes up again. Have you heard of the old village?
6192355000531298 I have. Was Rubin's fate decided there?
6192355000531299 The Ear, yes. I've been there.
6192355000531300 Everything is decided there. The soil there is thin, so one can hear everything.\nUnderstand, esegher, that only in your world do people decide who lives and who dies. Think so highly of themselves. We do not think, we listen. Everything happens on its own.
6192355000531301 If that was true, you'd still be walking on all fours.
6192355000531302 You're in too much of a hurry to call me that. I am not your father.
6192355000531303 Consider a flock of birds. Birds give no advice, no speeches. They take wing all at once and go where they need. For they know how to listen. They know not the concept of self. They fear death not.\nYou'll become like that, too. All who come to Shekhen understand.
6192355000531304 I won't. I'm different.
6192355000531305 Perhaps later, when I am smarter.
6192355000531306 That place is a ruin. It offers no understanding.
6192355000531308 So you say you know how to connect things… which is why you cut, rip, and break them. Just like your father.
6192355000531309 Rubin made a cure for the sand pest, and he made it from strange blood. And you know a lot about blood.
6192355000531312 Rubin… Who's Rubin?
6192355000531313 My father's apprentice. Didn't he come to you?
6192355000531314 A friend of mine. So you don't know him…
6192355000531315 Lots of idiots found their way into Isidor's circle. Although I guess not all of them were completely stupid…\nSo he made a cure, huh? You sure? From blood? So its price will rise…
6192355000531316 No. That was special blood. Human won't do.
6192355000531317 Fat chance. Blood's only getting cheaper these days.
6192355000531318 A cure, huh… You're a big talker.\nWhat does a smartass like you want from me? Advice? Here: if you tell on me to that unholy wench, I'll claw my way out of hell to drag you back down with me. Got it?
6192355000531319 Like she needs you… Tell me, has anyone ever brought you unusual blood?
6192355000531320 I won't tell on you. And in return, you'll tell me where to find the most unusual blood in this town.
6192355000531321 No. Although…
6192355000531322 Well?
6192355000531323 Why are you smiling?
6192355000531324 Herb Brides dance with the earth at the Ear. Did you know? To make twyre bloom better. Cover themselves in some sort of mud that they call blood.\nYou can probably pick its sample there if you want. I bet you haven't yet tried to brew a cure from mud, huh? Ha ha ha…
6192355000531325 I'm asking a serious question, but it's just a joke to you. Damn it…
6192355000531327 You know what? I'll pay them a visit.
6192355000545451 Did you hear what Mother told you? Our body is whole. We won't let you break it. She won't let you break it.\nDid you understand, Khatangher? We leave only as a whole.
6192355000545452 Then go. What's holding you here?
6192355000545455 Yeah, yeah, I got it. You're all a single organism. The girl's not leaving without you all.
6192355000545461 We want to look him in the eye. Touch his eyes with ours.
6192355000545462 Yeah, I know all too well what you mean by that.
6192355000545463 I'll bring you the person responsible.
6192355000545513 Happy now?
6192355000545514 I didn't expect you'd actually come.
6192355000545515 There wasn't enough… I sent people to seize him and drag him to my place, but he was long gone…\nSo I came here to rescue the boy. But he wasn't here, either…
6192355000545516 So you risked everything for your son?
6192355000545517 I didn't expect this from you, boös. I took you for a completely heartless creature.
6192355000545518 Help me get out of here, will you?
6192355000545519 I'll try. I'll lead the Kin away from here. That's what it was all about, anyway.
6192355000545520 That's not how it works. You must be held accountable for your crimes.
6192355000546051 
6192355000546052 
6192355000546053 
6192355000546054 
6192355000546055 
6192355000546056 
6192355000546057 Rubin is dead. And I think I know who is responsible for this.
6192355000546058 
6192355000546059 
6192355000546060 Who killed Rubin? The Kin, who spilled no blood? His conscience, which could never find peace? The friend, who failed in his task, my task?\n\nIt doesn't matter, I suppose. In the end, Stakh is dead.
6192355000547951 That's all right… That's all right… We'll take it all back. Our feet are firmly planted. Even if it all comes crumbling down, even if every single one of them dies, we will rebuild it.
6192355000547952 Do you know what's going on in the Termitary, boös?
6192355000547955 Have you… forgotten something?
6192355000547956 Your son's in danger. He intends to go to the Termitary. To calm your people down.
6192355000547957 Listen… Take care of my daughter. She's the last of our family now.
6192355000547958 I'll drag you out of this, too.
6192355000547959 I will.
6192355000547960 You won't. We're done for. Just save my daughter! Give me your word you'll save her.
6192355000547961 I will.
6192355000547962 It's impossible. She's beyond salvation now.
6192355000547963 Our family's over, Burakh. It's time… to pay. My daughter is no more… Did you come to gloat?
6192355000547964 No. Just to watch.
6192355000547965 What can I do for you?
6192355000547966 Nothing. Forgive me if I ever wronged you.
6192355000547967 I do.
6192355000547968 God is merciful.
6192355000547969 The victims…
6192355000547970 Better ask me how many survivors. Not a lot.
6192355000547971 To make the Factory work again… at a third of its power, at least… to cover the most urgent deliveries… Are there a thousand left, at least?
6192355000547972 Go and count yourself. Those are your people, boös.
6192355000547973 I have special people on payroll who do just that… but they have no way of getting inside. Or… maybe you can guide them in? Since you've apparently found a hole.
6192355000547974 They're waiting for you, boös.
6192355000547975 And they're seeking my blood? I'll go… but not right now. Later. When things calm down.\nGo back to your business, my boy. Thanks for the news, but it's nothing new. So go.
6192355000547976 Go to them, boös. Now. They want to look you in the eye.
6192355000547980 Your son is going to the Termitary.
6192355000547981 What for?
6192355000547982 To confess. He was the one who locked up the Termitary. You didn't even know, did you?
6192355000547983 The whelp… The idiotic whelp… I didn't know? <i>I</i> didn't know?!
6192355000547984 So you did?
6192355000547985 That whelp is too cocky, thinking he's responsible for anything… Too eager to take my place…\nNo, it's a bit too early for him to get in my way. <i>I</i> am the Master… This is <i>my</i> business. <i>I</i> will bear the consequences.
6192355000547986 So what's your plan?
6192355000547987 …I'm sending people to seize that whelp and get him over here. Let him wallow in his conscience here… Guilty, pah! Responsible, my ass!
6192355000547988 Don't you think you should go there instead?
6192355000547992 
6192355000547993 
6192355000547994 Are you out of your mind, my boy? I'm not going anywhere now. And I would advise you follow my example.
6192355000547995 Scared?
6192355000547996 Your son is going there in your stead. I just wanted to let you know.
6192355000547997 Who do you take me for? You dare bully me? You dare push <i>me?</i> I'll rip all your throats out! And I won't even break a sweat! You pathetic weeds, you mindless calves…
6192355000547998 I warned you, boös.
6192355000548001 Better you go to them now… than they come to you later. Let them look you in the eye. That's how they say it.
6192355000548003 So do I. I saw them. Else I wouldn't be here.
6192355000548004 If you go to them now, you'll do it as a master. But if you linger, your role will change.
6192355000548006 Idiot! Oh, what an idiot! He still takes them for people. It's all fun and games to him… but they're not people, they're bloodthirsty beasts. They'll tear his head off.
6192355000548007 So you'll surrender yourself in his stead?
6192355000548008 They just want to look you in the eye.
6192355000548009 You are a gullible kid, Master Burakh… You have the heart of a dove. If you value your life so little, go to them yourself… Your legs are still young. But spare me your ridiculous ideas. I am a sane man.
6192355000548010 I warned you. If things turn bad, it'll be your fault.
6192355000548011 They will, believe me.
6192355000548012 I'll send my people to seize that dimwit and bring him here. He can remain… in my custody for a while. It's for the best.\nRemember how you refused my protection… how that turned out?
6192355000548013 Everything turned out fine.
6192355000548014 Where is he now? Do you know?
6192355000548015 In that ruined house with the well, as always.
6192355000548016 Who knows…? He doesn't report to me.
6192355000548017 Find him on your own. You have enough people.
6192355000548018 Yeah. My overshoes.
6192355000548019 You're a funny man, Burakh… Read too many romantic novels, do you? Keep to your anatomy books…
6192355000548020 What do you mean?
6192355000548021 What do books have to do with it? Those are your people. You need to go. Not him.
6192355000548024 
6192355000548025 Now is not a good time. I'm headed out.
6192355000548026 Why?
6192355000548027 Preparing for your final journey?
6192355000548030 Have you heard what happened with the Termitary?
6192355000548031 I have.
6192355000548032 The Kin are no more.
6192355000548033 Leave Father out of this. It was me. I did it.
6192355000548034 …What do you mean? <i>You?</i>
6192355000548035 Stop this. They were doomed.
6192355000548036 No, Burakh, they were not. They could have fled. Could have cured themselves. Could have survived, if they'd had any freedom of movement at all…
6192355000548037 Perhaps.
6192355000548038 I ordered the Termitary shut, Burakh. Not my father. Me. Just before you arrived. Father covered for me later…
6192355000548039 Why did you do it?
6192355000548040 There was a riot there, or so I was told. Now I understand what scared them… but back then, I wasn't thinking about that at all.
6192355000548041 What were you thinking about?
6192355000548042 Back then, I thought Father's wrath was the worst possible threat they could face. I was wrong… but no one could have known about this plague!\nI was wrong. But now, I'll make it right. I'll go to them.
6192355000548043 Why go there? You can't fix anything.
6192355000548044 "If, if, if."
6192355000548045 Why did he do it?
6192355000548046 We have a complicated relationship. Haven't I told you already? Father believes that his will the only thing that matters; that all decisions are his own.\nTo his credit, this includes his unpopular decisions, too.
6192355000548047 Did you know about the plague? Why did you lock the Termitary?
6192355000548049 
6192355000548050 
6192355000548151 Messenger
6192355000548851 Oh, I will… I've no plan to tremble at the sight of them… <i>They</i> will cower with their tails between their legs. I am the power. I am the authority. And they know it.
6192355000548852 They've changed. Recent events have transformed them. Sand pest does that to people.
6192355000550151 Why go there… Why go there? <i>Why go there!</i>\nBecause I can't <i>not</i> go, Burakh. Because this is <i>my</i> doing. Because I must see the place. And look them in the eye.
6192355000550152 They want your father's blood, but they won't refuse yours.
6192355000550153 All the more reason to go.
6192355000550154 Don't go. Please.
6192355000550155 Go. This is the right thing to do.
6192355000550156 Tell them to leave Father alone.
6192355000550157 I'll try.
6192355000550158 It's useless.
6192355000550159 Everything is as it should be, Burakh. As it should.
6192355000550160 You have an odd understanding of duty.
6192355000550161 You're weak. This is the easiest way out.
6192355000550162 I truly wanted to be a good master for them, Burakh. They're a wonderful people… I still believe that.\nThey're not animals. They're… water. Father took them for beasts, so they reflected his expectations. Shifted to fit that shape.
6192355000550163 What did you plan to do? Educate them?
6192355000550164 Why are you still alive…?
6192355000550165 Are you kidding? It's the other way around.\nI wanted to preserve their culture. Their language. Their rites. To transform the whole business, so it wouldn't… <i>devolve</i> them into cattle!
6192355000550166 And turn the Abattoir back into a temple? Your factory wouldn't have lasted long.
6192355000550167 No need for such extremes. Slowly, step by step, I could find a way to make the Kin live in peace with the Town.\nThey could just herd the cattle. We have enough workers, after all.
6192355000550168 Sounds utopian.
6192355000550169 Yes, Burakh, it <i>is</i> a utopia. Everyone in this town is trying to build one. Didn't you notice? Everyone is trying to make something new, something no one before them has ever made.
6192355000550170 Yeah, I've noticed.
6192355000550184 Cat's out of the bag now.
6192355000550185 What do you mean?
6192355000550186 What are you doing here?
6192355000550187 I sympathize with the Olgimskys, I do. But the father and son were too different, you see. Incompatible. Hence the catastrophe.\nIt's always like that with them… with this town, too. The gears grind; they can't move in harmony. And we see the results…
6192355000550189 Time sets everything in its place. Each had his own vision of the Bull Enterprise… They got in each other's way, the father and son. Now there will be calm, and the gears will turn as before.\nBut <i>why?</i> Why does calm have to come at such a steep price…? To hell with that damned Factory! But why do we have to make these unbearable choices?
6192355000550190 What makes you think only one of them will survive?
6192355000550191 One of them must go to the Termitary. And I think it'll be the Younger. He's firmly decided.\nBut I went to the Elder… I think it's better for him to go, rather than the Younger. If I were him, I'd go in my son's stead… But no one would let me speak to him…
6192355000550192 Young Vlad decided to go to the Termitary? Why?
6192355000550193 His conscience. I was just with him—I spoke to him. About everything…\nIn the end, he's going. How can I stop him? I'm sorry it happened this way… I shouldn't have paid him that visit.
6192355000550194 Were you the one who told him about the Termitary?
6192355000550195 He'd have found out anyway. He was keeping a close eye on it. If not today, tomorrow.\nI thought it would be better if he learned it from me. I wanted to comfort him. It wasn't his fault.
6192355000550196 I'm familiar with your sort of "comfort." You make everyone feel guilty.
6192355000550197 You witch… You probably pushed him to do it in the first place!
6192355000550198 Is he at his place? I'll talk him out of it myself.
6192355000550199 Like hell you will! If even <i>I</i> failed…\nAnd you won't get there in time, anyway. He's already on his way.
6192355000550200 I bet you haven't even tried.
6192355000550201 I'll get there in time.
6192355000550202 That's all right. I have a better idea…
6192355000550209 Be khara, neither wisdom nor strength speak through you now. We hear pity. It is an absurd feeling. Leave it to women.
6192355000550210 I can see the hunger in your eyes. What else do you want from me?
6192355000550212 And where is Oyun? He wasn't here with us when we were dying. The fire forged us anew. We are a new people now.\nHe did not burn here with us. He did not mix with our new body.
6192355000550213 Neither did I. So what?
6192355000552251 You've done well, yargachin. All Lines lead to the heart, yes? All converge in the same spot.\nThis is the spot where our fate connects to yours.
6192355000552252 How did the Olgimskys get here?
6192355000552253 You are very wise, yargachin. You chose not to interfere. Not to touch anyone. Not to spread the infection of knowledge.\nNow we have both murderers, not just one. Both came here of their own volition. Neither knew of the other's plans.\nEvil always devours itself.
6192355000552254 Let them go in peace.
6192355000552256 Father and son are of the same stock. You are one with your father, aren't you? Where once he was, now you stand. \nA body is whole. A people is whole. It lives within you. You live through it. Isn't that so?
6192355000552257 It is so.
6192355000552258 No.
6192355000552259 What do you want of this man? He isn't innocent. His guilt will burn him from within. We will only make sure the fire doesn't fade.
6192355000552260 …That's what you did to Rubin!
6192355000552261 Let him go. That's my request.
6192355000552262 We want you to take your rightful place among our people. To rule us. We need strength. Authority. Accept it. Hold its burden. Be our father, yargachin.
6192355000552263 What do you mean?
6192355000552264 No. I don't want to lose myself.
6192355000552265 You'll wash your hands with blood and lose yourself slowly so that your people live. You'll eat fire to see your Khatanghe live. You'll be responsible for the blood we spill.\nYour burden. The yoke of the powerful. Do we have your word?
6192355000552267 No. This isn't my path.
6192355000552274 Why have you come, yargachin?
6192355000552275 Aren't you happy to see me?
6192355000552276 We'd rather see boös, Fat Vlad. That's who we were expecting.
6192355000552277 Tough luck. There's no need to spill blood. Leave both Olgimskys alone.
6192355000552278 I'll take care of them.
6192355000552279 You can't take care of anyone, not yet. You're no one. You run from fate like a hare.\nBut you can still become yourself.
6192355000552280 How?
6192355000552281 No.
6192355000552282 What do you mean, no?
6192355000552283 Just in case. The answer is no. You had a request, did you not?
6192355000552285 I see.
6192355000552286 Yes. It's about the Olgimskys.
6192355000552287 I plan to have a long conversation with all three Olgimskys.\nHm… I can tell by your look not all of them remain. What happened?
6192355000552288 They lie in a pit in the Termitary. The workers plan an execution.
6192355000552289 Big Vlad went to the Termitary to protect his son.
6192355000552290 Young Vlad went to the Termitary to protect his father.
6192355000552300 I'm sorry. But I will not interfere. That is not what my purpose is.
6192355000552301 What is it, then?
6192355000552302 Do you really think I'm about to explain it to you, in detail? Please don't dispel my impression that you're a smart man.
6192355000552304 In that case, I think I should just go.

6192355000556861 
6192355000556862 
6192355000556863 All questions seem to lead to the Kin. Father's murderer? His debt? The damned udurgh? Tycheek, the Kin's voice, will explain.\n\nBut he's in the Termitary. I'll have to fight my way in.
6192355000556864 
6192355000556865 
6192355000556866

6192355000556884 I saw one of the Termitary's rooms in a dream. I believe it was Tycheek's place.
6192355000556885 
6192355000556886 
6192355000556887 Neither the Kin nor Taya agree to her being separated from the people. The only way to save her from that dead place is together with them.
6192355000556888 
6192355000556889 
6192355000556890 The Kin want to look in the eyes of the man who locked them in the Termitary: Vlad Olgimsky. Vlad Olgimsky…
6192355000556891 In the Olgimsky family, Big Vlad is the one making decisions. But I doubt it'll be easy to convince him to throw himself at the Kin's mercy. Although, given the consequences...
6192355000556892 Young Vlad is more flexible than his father and easier to reach an agreement with. But he's not the person in charge.
6192355000556893 Young Vlad is more flexible and easier to come to an agreement with than his father. But in the Olgimsky house, he's not the person in charge.

6192355000561453 Move along, move along... what do you want here? Having a death wish, are you? If they see you, they'll attack, no questions asked.
6192355000561454 Why don't you attack me then?
6192355000561455 I was just... looking.
6192355000561456 Me, I'm having a wonderful time here, heavenly dew dissolving in my chest. It's like I'm seeing God and his angels.
6192355000561457 Dew, you say? That's an early symptom of the sand pest. Dew in the chest and angels singing.
6192355000561458 Ah, so, not so sober? Got it.
6192355000561459 Are you for real?
6192355000561460 Absolutely. I'm a doctor myself. But I <i>can</i> help you.
6192355000561461 Nah, just kidding.
6192355000561462 ...Right, and I am to lead you in, secretly, and then keep mum? I've seen your kind before.\nFat Vlad would flay me alive for that, and Saburov would pour salt all over me to make sure I remember my duties!
6192355000561463 So you're a smart one. But the protective potion is real. I take it myself.
6192355000561464 In that case, forget it.
6192355000561465 ...Look, here's the deal. We're talking six... no, seven vials of your potion, not one. 'Cause I'm a family man. And don't even think about offering cash.
6192355000561466 Deal.
6192355000561467 Seven? Don't you know that greed is a sin?
6192355000561468 Nah, pal. Look for someone with more free time on their hands.
6192355000561469 Eight it is then. Should we keep talking?
6192355000561470 Whatever.
6192355000561471 No. That would be enough talking.
6192355000561472 Do you have it?
6192355000561473 Here you go. Just be quiet.
6192355000561474 Nah, just checking if you're still breathing, pal.
6192355000561485 How many times do I have to tell you riff-raff... There's a quaranteent! So if you poke your nose in here one more time, you're over, dove. Got it?
6192355000561486 By "over", do you mean dead?
6192355000561487 Got it.
6192355000561488 Don't "dove" me. I'm a bigger creature.
6192355000561489 Wanna check?
6192355000561490 No.
6192355000561491 Brawl? I'm in. Go for it!

6192355000562852 
6192355000562853 Young Vlad considers himself responsible for what happened. He intends to accept punishment.
6192355000562854 
6192355000562855 
6192355000562856 It was Young Vlad who locked up the Termitary. He deems himself responsible for what happened to the Kin and will go to them voluntarily.\n\nIs this the outcome I want?
6192355000562857 
6192355000562858 
6192355000562859 Big Vlad considers himself responsible for everything. It seems he loves his son more than he shows.\n\nHe will replace Young Vlad before the Kin.
6192355000562860 
6192355000562861 
6192355000562862 Both Olgimskys faced the Kin's judgement themselves, without me.
6192355000562863 Neither Olgimsky faced the Kin, but the Kindred do not care. They never do.\n\nThey still want a leader.
6192355000562864 
6192355000562865 
6192355000562866 Fat Vlad knows of his son's plans now. No need to talk to Vlad the Younger. He must be stopped before he causes harm…\n\nI doubt either of them will come to the Termitary now.
6192355000562867 Young Vlad is in the Kin's hands now. He was a decent man, but he must answer for his actions.
6192355000562868 Big Vlad is in the Kin's hands now. He wasn't responsible for what happened, but he accepted the punishment nonetheless.
6192355000562869 The Kin will listen to me now. But they can't move forward, torn apart as they are. I need to heal their wounds.

6192355000584061 I met the Plague here… I think.
6192355000584062 Gumstone
6192355000584063 Gravel, Bad Grief, Stakh, and I used to leave each other notes here when we were kids.

6192355000584065 
6192355000584066 The nature of this disease is unknown. Father could defeat these, too. If only I could remember his lessons…\n\nI only know an iota of what he did. But I'll make a panacea.
6192355000584067 Father's death was so untimely. I learned too little from him. \n\nNo one will hand me a recipe. I'll have to work through trial and error—blindly.
6192355000584068 Wrong. Trying out infected tissues leads nowhere. I need to think outside the box here.
6192355000584069 The panacea requires a non-existent component. I need to pour a paradox into the alembic.\n\nBut I refuse to give in. Sooner or later, I'll find the answer. Or it will find me.
6192355000584070 The medicine has been produced. But there's very little of it. For now, it's more proof of concept than a solution.\n\nStill, I think I'll soon find the right person to share this discovery with.
6192355000584071 To defeat an enemy, one must understand it. And I don't mean a biological study. What <i>is</i> this plague?
6192355000584072 I know slightly more about the plague now. I need to keep searching. Even silly rumors may hold a grain of truth.
6192355000584073 This outbreak is no mere cholera, pox, or flu. It has a hidden meaning, one you can't study with a microscope. \n\nI need to keep investigating.
6192355000584074 They say not all victims of the sand pest die. They say there was a will behind the outbreak. They say it came from Earth.\n\nIt's not just a disease.
6192355000584075 The plague has a voice. Now I'm certain of it. Can it truly have a personality, a mind, a will?
6192355000584076 Charm
6192355000584171 You hear and come to us. You are, truly, a good doctor.
6192355000584172 Who are you?
6192355000584173 A mere reflection, sir.
6192355000584174 Where's your owner?
6192355000584175 I reflect the house. Why have you come, sir?
6192355000584176 No reason, just passing by.
6192355000584177 Honestly? To see if there's anything worth looting.
6192355000584178 Or so you think. But other forces bring you here, and not into another house.\nYou, doctor, hear the call of bodies lain with sickness, rasping breath and falt'ring heart. You came when needed. Do so more often.
6192355000584179 Why?
6192355000584180 That is for you to figure out, Burakh. Perhaps this place designs to share a story of toil and trouble. Perhaps it proffers gifts. Perhaps it wants to seize something from you.
6192355000584181 There's nothing I have that it could take.
6192355000584182 I'm more of a home invader right this instant. A burglar, I suppose.
6192355000584183 A "reflection"? Whose?
6192355000584184 Houses have souls? Huh. I didn't know that.
6192355000584185 The Town has need of ways to speak to those who cannot speak her language, sir.
6192355000584186 A town is just streets and buildings. I can tell what's alive from what isn't.
6192355000584187 So what is this house trying to tell me?
6192355000584188 How about it get me something to eat, first?
6192355000584189 I would, but people get in my way.
6192355000584190 A wheelwright used to call this house his home. The only such craftsman in town. Our mills are not for making wheels; they are for breaking bulls to gristle, bone, and blood.
6192355000584191 Where did the whole thing with hanging wheels everywhere start?
6192355000584192 What kind of wheels? Cart wheels?
6192355000584193 Not wheels that bear a load; wheels to adorn a home. When wood was easily found, he'd make them.
6192355000584194 Whatever for?
6192355000584195 A wheel's a charm of labor's slow contentment; a circle, cycle, spinning sun of hope.
6192355000584196 Are they? They make me think of… eyes.
6192355000588252 A wheel's at rest; a line's in motion, lost. It is a frightful fancy, time's arrow; a line that cuts ever forward. Better to see the world swung around in a sling. For death cannot exist where circles turn.
6192355000588253 But eternity is its own form of horror.
6192355000588254 Bah. Waste of good timber.
6192355000588255 Labor, eh? Our town has its hands in the muck but its head in the sky.
6192355000588256 What troubles you about that, Burakh? The filth of carving meat and tanning hides? It ties us down to Earth and lays the deep foundation 'neath a tall and shining factory…
6192355000588257 A dream factory? One that churns out futile fantasies of a better life?
6192355000588258 A factory for processing people into ideas?
6192355000588261 What troubles you about <i>that,</i> Burakh? That's how the circle turns into a line; an arrow fired into the darkened void. So wheels may warm a home more than a hearth.
6192355000588262 …Does all this circular logic <i>do</i> anything?
6192355000588263 \n…Why not just draw a line in the first place, then!
6192355000588264 It looks like adherents of the Kains live in this house.
6192355000588265 This hollow house was home to water carters. From springs they'd bring their barrels every Thursday. Fortune, mere luck, returned them to us before the Town was struck, lock'd, quarantined.
6192355000588266 How long can this water supply last?
6192355000588267 I've noticed the drinking fountains in the streets. They weren't there when I left.
6192355000588268 I reckon five or maybe six more days. Depending mainly on the people's thirst. No one is there to watch the barrels.
6192355000588269 Guards will probably be posted soon.
6192355000588270 An aqueduct, left sorely incomplete by great Olgimsky masters, works sometimes. The Gorkhon's water can't be purified.
6192355000588271 Meaning the aqueduct might fail any day?
6192355000588272 Indeed. Our hope still rides the water carts. But quarantine has locked them in, empty.
6192355000588273 So we'll be running out of water soon.
6192355000588274 If the water runs out, we'll drink twyrine.
6192355000588275 It's odd that there's been no panic about the water so far. I suppose not everyone's figured it out yet…
6192355000588276 Two families live within these walls, and both have sought Stamatin's pub to pawn their last few heirlooms, sir. The man is buying gold.
6192355000588279 What could he want with gold?
6192355000588280 Who is this Stamatin?
6192355000588281 Perhaps the man has hope to spare, and thinks this sickness comes and goes while gold remains. If not, he knows a thing or two we don't.
6192355000588282 Why does an architect own a pub? Is he that well-off?
6192355000588283 An architect; two brothers: Peter, Andrey. One dreamed up the Polyhedron's shape; the other dreamed up a way to keep his brother safe. While Peter architects his buildings, Andrey architects his schemes.
6192355000588284 If he's an architect, why does he own a pub?
6192355000588285 A brave fellow, he makes and sells that dire faerie, twyrine. Perhaps he was the man who first distilled the drink that grips the town.
6192355000588286 Twyrine isn't for everyone.
6192355000588287 A dangerous drink.
6192355000588288 Peter's a great lover of twyrine, sir. Indeed, the Town itself exemplifies what twyrine does to living bodies.
6192355000588289 What do you mean?
6192355000588290 Agreed…
6192355000588291 Ingenious fancy worked its way from dream to matter. Such reality: fierce, bright, burning, unendurable light of reason. Only a child can bear it. Only children can probe the Polyhedron, see within it.
6192355000588292 I've heard of that.
6192355000588293 I'd love to take a look for myself.
6192355000588294 Don't despair… Even a torn family can be sewn back together. Sometimes, grief can be the common thread.
6192355000588295 That's what Brother says, too…
6192355000588296 Does he live here with you?
6192355000588297 Yes. Any deed is twice as difficult without a father…
6192355000593369 Is he okay now?
6192355000593370 No. I failed.
6192355000593371 But you gave him the pills! Did they not work?
6192355000593372 I couldn't reduce his infection. If I gave him the right pill, that might have delayed it…
6192355000593373 What use is delaying it?! He'll still die! Only with more suffering…
6192355000593374 You don't know what you're talking about. As long as he lives, a cure can be sought.
6192355000593375 I chose the wrong pill.
6192355000593376 So how do we cure him? When will you know?
6192355000593377 Eventually. These things take time.
6192355000593378 Any delay on the path to death is a victory.
6192355000593379 If only I could figure out what it was…
6192355000595351 Oyun's Reflection
6192355000595352 Nine years ago my master woefully took the job of foreman to the Abattoir. Olgimsky sought a kinsman he could trust to force his will upon the Kin, to quell rebellion 'gainst the bitter yoke of toil.
6192355000595353 I remember that. Everyone hated him.
6192355000595354 I believe the Kin despises him.
6192355000595355 The Kin will follow strength as rule of law.\nOyun is not a fool; he knew enough to see: One does not rule by giving orders.\nNo man can rule the Kin. Tycheek or Sahba aside, only Elder Burakh came close.
6192355000595356 The Kin obeys neither strength nor spirit.
6192355000595357 Why would the Kin need a ruler at all? The Kin are a hive.
6192355000595358 The Kin can only listen, like a realm of infants. Follow no laws, but feel keenly. What do they feel, Burakh?
6192355000595359 Hell if I know.
6192355000595360 Same as everyone. Pain. Anxiety. Sorrow. Hope.
6192355000595361 Oyun does know his place; no king of shreds and patches, but the King's silent shadow.\nHe dreams of one to take his place; a man to lead the Kin upriver, towards the long-forgotten past. But strong he is.
6192355000595362 Does the Kin <i>need</i> the ways of the past? Isn't it better to look to the future?
6192355000595363 What is strength, Reflection?
6192355000595364 The Kin are slaves, gristle for the mill Olgimsky built to drown the Town in coin.\nThis road leads to no future but our end.
6192355000595365 Same fate awaits us all.
6192355000595366 Who could have thought such a hulking man worries about such issues.
6192355000595367 Do you believe yourself strong, Burakh? Then tell me what this strength is born from.
6192355000595368 Your master knows the answer. Strength lies in fear.
6192355000595369 Strength is the power to say "no."

6192355000596553 
6192355000597151 Wait a bit longer. I'll speak my mind soon.
6192355000597152 No. Wait a bit. I'll take a look at his body first.
6192355000597153 [Chest has been punctured. Massive wound, couldn't have been a knife. Some massive, cone-shaped object. A horn or claw, maybe.]
6192355000597154 [I should pull away the fabric covering the body, now.]
6192355000597155 [I've seen the vital part. Shouldn't investigate further. Could be seen as blasphemous.]
6192355000597156 [Skin dry to the touch, suspicious. Unusual degree of xerosis. He wasn't that old…]
6192355000597157 [I should continue the examination.]
6192355000597158 [Enough. This is my father.]
6192355000597159 [Soil under his fingernails. Unlike him. Always kept his hands clean…]
6192355000597160 [Three oddities, then. The murder weapon, the dry skin, and the condition of his hands.]
6192355000597161 [Enough. This is a cemetery, not a morgue. A fuller picture would require an autopsy. I refuse to do it.]
6192355000597851 I gave Patches the wrong antibiotic. He's just as sick as before. And I can't administer more drugs to him today.
6192355000601551 He was murdered. That's all I needed to know. Murdered.
6192355000601552 Yes, Father was murdered. But… I got the impression that something was unwell with him even before his death. It doesn't matter now, though.
6192355000601553 He was murdered. That's all I needed to know. Murdered.
6192355000601554 Yes, Father was murdered. But… I got the impression that something was unwell with him even before his death. It doesn't matter now, though.
6192355000601555 
6192355000601556 I chose not to examine Father's body. I just… can't.

6192355000620451 Bull Blood
6192355000620452 Useless for crafting. Show this to Dankovsky?
6192355000620453 Living Blood
6192355000620454 This flask is heavy like a rock. This is special blood. What can it be used for?

6192355000633553 The Kin resent Rubin. If I don't get rid of the Kindred, Stakh will be locked in his Warehouse until the Gorkhon runs dry.
6192355000633554 Four people are waiting for Stakh in the Warehouses. If I want to protect my friend, I'll have to clear his way.
6192355000633555 
6192355000633556 
6192355000633557 Rubin is safe for today. Tomorrow, I'll see if it was worth it.
6192355000633558 I won't get into fights with my own Khatanghe over Stakh. If he's angered the Kin somehow, that's his problem to solve.
6192355000633559 
6192355000633560 
6192355000633561 They're camping on Rubin's doorstep again. Getting closer, like wolves.\n\nIt's hard to deal with so many opponents at once. But all I need is to lure them away from Rubin so that he can flee.
6192355000633562 
6192355000633563 
6192355000633564 
6192355000633565 I think Stakh has successfully fled. Now all I need is to survive myself.
6192355000633566 I did not help Stakh.

6192355000640452 If you come into your legacy, you will know more. I am its keeper, and I will give you everything that is now rightfully yours.\nBut we can not abandon your father's body. By the rites of our people, he should have been buried yesterday.
6192355000640453 What are we to do with it?
6192355000640454 Indeed. If you abandon your wife, she will just embrace someone else. And that is dangerous.
6192355000640455 Is that so? Why?
6192355000640456 I don't care.
6192355000643151 
6192355000643152 
6192355000643153 Soon, a bull will walk the Town's streets to touch it for the last time. Then it will be slaughtered.

6192355000651851 It's spreading across Earth—the lower Town. Between the Gullet and the Abattoir.
6192355000651852 Thanks, Judge. I know what part of town is called Earth.
6192355000651853 Perhaps it won't cross the Gullet after all. Perhaps they'll barricade the bridges in time.
6192355000651854 Two architects live in Earth: Andrey and Peter Stamatin. Both geniuses, each in his own way. Please, take them into your care. You could let the whole Town die, but these two must survive!
6192355000651855 Why?
6192355000651856 I don't even know them.
6192355000651857 Because you won't find minds like theirs anywhere else on the whole continent. We hunted them for much too long. \nMy brother Simon collected many brilliant specimens in this town, you know. It is an ark.
6192355000651858 Where do they live?
6192355000651859 Why don't <i>you</i> take care of them, then?
6192355000651860 You are a doctor. You took the oath.
6192355000651861 All right. I'll keep an eye on them.
6192355000651862 Yes, an oath to all people. Not just to your handful of chosen ones.
6192355000651863 Peter lives in a loft in the Tanners. Andrey, though, rarely leaves the Broken Heart—his pub below the Factory. \nI put my hopes on you, doctor. Pay them a visit as soon as you can.
6192355000651864 I know that place—it's a twyrine den. I had no idea it's run by a genius.
6192355000651866 I'll take a look.
6192355000651867 The strict sanitary measures… Why? Will they help us maintain decency? This isn't plague, cholera, or pox. It's not some unstudied strain of flu. I have a suspicion that this is not a medical affliction at all.
6192355000651868 How can I help, Judge?
6192355000651869 People get sick and die. It's medical, all right.
6192355000651870 You are a steppe man. This affliction is clearly a steppe thing. In this situation, I'd rather rely on Burakh's son than on Dankovsky, even though he's a big-city star. The roots of this place go back to the Kin. To the ground. Or so I should think.
6192355000651871 I barely remember anything about my heritage anymore.
6192355000651872 The Kin consider me an outsider.
6192355000651873 Who cares?
6192355000651874 This entity has a purpose. A will. It wants something from us. It plays by some kind of rules. But what are those rules? How do you understand earth? Nature? These things—they speak a language that had been extinct long before we humans even stepped forth on the stage of Creation.
6192355000651875 Look, I'm not a philosopher.
6192355000651876 I would love to be your student, Judge.
6192355000651877 We'll see if we survive.
6192355000651894 …What does that mean for me?
6192355000653051 Yes, yes, I know. We're supposed to stay indoors. And the Tower's inhabitants do just that, I make sure my people follow the law. But I am Caspar Kain; your laws don't apply to me.
6192355000653052 What's up there in the Tower?
6192355000653053 Caspar Kain? So you're the one they call Khan? I've been looking for you.
6192355000653054 Wrong. They apply to everyone. Leaders most of all.
6192355000653055 The Tower is home to youth. Almost three hundred people inside. All safe. Like I said, I observe the quarantine. They're not allowed to leave.
6192355000653056 Why are <i>you</i> here, then?
6192355000653057 Who else is to risk their life but me?
6192355000653058 If you get sick, you'll bring the infection back in there with you. What were you thinking?
6192355000653059 Do you take me for an idiot, or a negligent bastard? Those are my people. I'm responsible for them. If I get sick, I won't ever return, <i>obviously.</i>
6192355000653060 What makes you think you'll notice immediately?
6192355000653061 Do they really obey? Who are you to disallow anything?
6192355000653062 I am Khan. Son of Victor Kain.
6192355000653063 You knew my father, Isidor Burakh. What business did you have with him?
6192355000653064 We talked. I was curious what Simon saw in him.
6192355000653065 Simon?
6192355000653066 Excuse me, were you born yesterday? Simon Kain. The head of our family. My uncle. The immortal man. The one who died two days ago. The one we can't live without. \nHe molded this town into what it is. He kept its spirit aflame. Do you honestly have no idea who he was?
6192355000653068 I'm a local. And I know about Simon. Mind your manners.
6192355000653069 A brave lad, are you… So, why are you here?
6192355000653070 To negotiate with Notkin over there. Any more questions?
6192355000653071 Are you two friends?
6192355000653072 We're enemies, after a fashion. His Soul-and-a-Halves against my Dogheads. But we're negotiating an armistice now. If he lets go of his usual bullheadedness, it might happen.\nAre you happy now? Can we get back to our business?
6192355000653073 No, I'm not done yet. Do you know how my father died?
6192355000653074 I see. And what business do you have with Notkin?
6192355000653075 Why do you ask? It's not like he's your son.
6192355000653076 No. But we got to know each other, in a way. What are you up to?
6192355000653077 You're a doctor. I respect your future heroism. So I am offering you an overabundance of politesse.
6192355000653078 What are you two up to?
6192355000653079 Do you know who I am?
6192355000653080 No. Not yet. I have a hypothesis… but it's too early to tell. I'll have to check.
6192355000653081 Check what?
6192355000653083 …Fine. I can tell you're not lying.
6192355000653084 No. I think you're too old to believe in fairy tales. A skeptic would only get in the way. So I won't even waste time explaining.
6192355000653085 But I do believe you. Now, I do. And I'm coming with you.
6192355000653086 You're way too strict for your age, kids… Perhaps your friend over there has more time. I mean. Your enemy.
6192355000662951 Put your purse away, ripper. We don't trade for money anymore.
6192355000662952 What's that supposed to mean?
6192355000662953 Drag your ears out of your pockets, will you? Coupons! All food is only sold for coupons now. Inquisitorial decree, to crucify profiteers.
6192355000662954 Are you kidding? Where do I get them?
6192355000662955 I have coupons. Show me the goods.
6192355000662956 Go to the Town Hall and ask yourself. I suppose they'll add coupons to the Fund rewards. You doctors are the upper crust now, after all!
6192355000662957 I'd like to eat <i>before</i> I get the Fund reward.
6192355000666990 I suppose I should look around the pharmacy the embalmers operate from. They're bound to jump at an opportunity to work near their base.
6192355000666991 How?
6192355000666992 A hammer, maybe… I bet someone must be taking care of them, boarding the tomb off.
6192355000666994 Each house has a sound of its own. One that has dead people inside can't sound like a normal one.
6192355000666995 Don't mind that. I'll find the place and mark it with a cross for your people to find.
6192355000666998 We need to find an abandoned house. The Dogheads, the snobs, only see things from their ivory tower… My Soul-and-a-Halves know the Town inside and out. Abandoned houses most of all.
6192355000666999 What kind of house?
6192355000667000 The House of Death. Have you heard the story? The candles, the dawn, the locked door?
6192355000667001 No.
6192355000667002 Things like what's happened yesterday and the day before… They never happened. People died, yes, but not like this.\nDeath has come to town. And Death is quite a bird—a homebird, to be precise. So when he comes, he stays in an abandoned house. Even Death needs a place to rest.
6192355000667003 Uh huh.
6192355000667004 Death comes at midnight. That's when trouble starts. But if someone were to find his house before midnight, then either stay there till dawn or light candles inside, he'd be stalled. \nAlso, you're supposed to become immortal… but I don't believe that last part.
6192355000667005 But you believe the rest of it?
6192355000667006 When there's smoke, there's fire. Khan is right about this part, at least. There's a grain of truth in any legend. \nTo hell with old grudges for now. My scouts and I are looking for the House of Death today. We'll start with the Crude Sprawl, I have a hunch it's there. Since your old man… I mean since so many people died there, that's where Death must feel at home.
6192355000667007 You shouldn't go there, kids. The streets are dangerous.
6192355000667008 I'll find the place myself. Let's see if there's any merit to this story.
6192355000667009 I'm not going to cower behind another man! And I want to show Khan the pedagogue how we do things down here. Let them hide in the Tower. We'll do the work.
6192355000667010 I'll find it myself. Stay here.
6192355000667011 That so? Okay, boy, we'll get there together.
6192355000667012 It's your funeral, boy.
6192355000669951 To devour the Town, worms need not kill humans. Earth will consume everyone herself.
6192355000669952 Do you mean to say the <i>plague</i> will consume everyone?
6192355000669953 Time for you to go to Olonngo. The Abattoir.
6192355000669954 Is the path to the blood clear?
6192355000669955 You're back. I can tell you've been inside.
6192355000669956 I'm back, yes.
6192355000669957 Do you know they are one and the same?\nWhat is Earth made of? Rocks, roots, water, worms, plague. Of might that no winter can overcome. Torture it all you want, she'll get her due while she yet lives.
6192355000669958 "While she yet lives," huh?
6192355000669959 
6192355000669960 
6192355000669961 
6192355000669962 
6192355000669963 
6192355000669969 Why are you surprised, yargachin?
6192355000669970 Your sisters… Do they dance with the plague?
6192355000669996 Few words. No throat. Hard to talk.
6192355000669997 What are you?
6192355000670251 I need to check up on one Anna Angel, a circus performer.
6192355000670252 Shekhen
6192355000670253 An abandoned steppe village.
6192355000670254 Stamatin's Loft
6192355000670255 The house of Peter Stamatin, architect and creator of the glass contraption on the other side of the river.
6192355000670256 The Rod
6192355000670257 The mansion of the Saburovs. This part belongs to Katerina, a Dream Mistress. A surreptitious murmur can be heard from these doors sometimes.
6192355000671351 I need to check up on architect Peter Stamatin's health.
6192355000671352 I need to check up on architect Andrey Stamatin's health.
6192355000671353 
6192355000671354 
6192355000671355 …Khan does seem to leave the Tower sometimes. Meaning one can only meet him when he chooses to be available. Noted.
6192355000671356 
6192355000671357 
6192355000671358 Death found himself a home in the Crude Sprawl. It sounds like an urban legend, but where there's smoke, there's fire.
6192355000671359 I don't have time to check every story children tell. I did not look for the House of Death.
6192355000671360 
6192355000671361 I don't know if Death really arrived to our town, or if it was just a bed of infection. What matters is I've found it, and the place will be quarantined. \n\nThe disease will bite off one district fewer now.
6192355000671362 I don't have time to check every story children tell. Let someone else go to the House of Death.
6192355000671363 
6192355000671364 
6192355000671365 A chemist is willing to pay urchins for the service of finding unburied corpses in uninfected houses.
6192355000671366 
6192355000671367 
6192355000671368 The chemist interpreted the Kains' ideas… strangely. He wants to help people understand death, but instead, he simply spreads infection. \n\nIt might be educational to let Victor know how the common people interpret their philosophies.
6192355000671369 
6192355000671370 
6192355000671371 People hide infected corpses at home. I can find such houses by the unhealthy sound—say, on the Bridge Square, close to the zealot's drugstore. When I do, I'll mark the door with a cross.\n\nIf this is left unchecked, infection will spread.
6192355000671372 Victor's people are his responsibility.
6192355000671373 
6192355000671374 
6192355000671375 I've found a house with a suspicious person inside. Is this the right one? I don't think there are corpses here, though…
6192355000671376 
6192355000671377 
6192355000671378 I've marked a suspicious house. Should I keep searching…?
6192355000671379 
6192355000671380 
6192355000671381 I've found the house where corpses were stashed.
6192355000671382 
6192355000671383 
6192355000671384 I marked a house with hidden corpses. Now the spread of infection will be curbed.
6192355000671385 I marked a house incorrectly. This won't help the spread of infection…
6192355000671386 I failed to find a house with unburied corpses. The spread of infection will continue.
6192355000671387 I marked another suspicious house. Just in case.
6192355000671388 
6192355000671389 
6192355000671390 Maria Kaina also marks houses. Healthy ones. \n\nShould I let Victor know? Or trust her reasoning?
6192355000671391 
6192355000671392 
6192355000671393 Let Maria do as she pleases. She's Nina's daughter. Our town has always been ruled by Mistresses.
6192355000671394 Victor will discipline his daughter. There will be no more marks on healthy houses.
6192355000676651 I've found a house with unburied corpses.
6192355000677151 He'll come forward on his own, soon.\nBut that's not important! Forget about revenge. I don't need it.
6192355000677152 You tricked me.
6192355000677161 Hello, my son.
6192355000677162 Who killed you, Father?
6192355000677163 What is important, then?
6192355000677178 Have you been there?
6192355000677179 Yes.
6192355000677183 What did you see?
6192355000677184 Death. Almost everyone is dead. Tycheek, too.
6192355000677185 There are survivors. They worship Tycheek's young daughter.
6192355000677186 Worship?
6192355000677187 She's like… a lucky charm to them. A shield from the plague.
6192355000677188 …So there are survivors. How many?
6192355000677189 Enough that I barely escaped.
6192355000677190 I don't know. By the screams, a hundred. Maybe two.
6192355000677651 
6192355000677652 
6192355000677653 All blood seeps from the Abattoir—perhaps, also, the blood I seek?
6192355000677654 
6192355000677655 
6192355000677656 Here, people drink blood to survive.
6192355000677657 
6192355000677658 
6192355000677659 Here, people dissect the living to understand.
6192355000677660 
6192355000677661 
6192355000677662 Here, people gnaw at each other like animals.
6192355000677663 
6192355000677664 
6192355000677665 Here, beasts live, not people. Life and death are the same to them. The red pit in the ground calls to me.
6192355000677666 
6192355000677667 
6192355000677668 
6192355000677669 His ear waits in the steppe. His heart, here, underground. I finally see. I understand.\n\nThe udurgh is my town.
6192355000677670 I see now what Foreman Oyun wanted to show me. I see everything now. I hope he's still waiting for me in Father's house.
6192355000677671 
6192355000677672 
6192355000677673 …Father deliberately let the plague into the Town.
6192355000677674 
6192355000679751 
6192355000679752 Chemist
6192355000679753 I'm not sharing my formula, if that's what you're after. I don't need competition, thank you very much. Or are you here to put a stop to my little enterprise? Like hell you will! I am the Kains' man. You belong to Olgimsky.
6192355000679754 Because of you, the Town floods with infected corpses.
6192355000679755 So the Kains ordered for corpses to be embalmed?
6192355000679756 I'm my own man.
6192355000679757 People want to protect their loved ones from the flames. Rightfully so. I'm helping them preserve those bodies, as is my duty. Do you think they'd throw the dead into your furnaces if I'm not there? Think again, steppe man.
6192355000679758 You're a criminal.
6192355000679759 Those are not my furnaces. Those are the furnaces of fate.
6192355000679760 The Kains don't need order. They inspire.\nBy their teachings, crossing the great border requires strange but simple steps. They despise death and refuse to play by its rules.\nWho knows? Perhaps preserving the bodies of the dead is the first step toward victory over death. Victor would approve of my work.
6192355000679761 What border?
6192355000679762 So Victor doesn't actually know about this, does he?
6192355000679763 Death is that border, the limit of our existence. Decay limits our capacity to survive as material creatures. Who knows what it takes to defeat death? Ancients believed that the dead might rise as living bodies.
6192355000679764 Are you sure the dead would want to be resurrected?
6192355000679765 You've lost it.
6192355000679766 Victor Kain is shouldering the burden of fighting the epidemic. I'm sure he's well aware of what I'm doing here. The Kains haven't stopped me—meaning they approve. This is the Kain way. To cattle, the greatest achievements seem like transgressions.
6192355000679767 We'll see about that, Kain servant.
6192355000679768 I'll pay him a visit and ask in person.
6192355000679769 Tell your people to stay out of my way, or they'll regret it.
6192355000682751 
6192355000682752 
6192355000682753 
6192355000682754 
6192355000682755 
6192355000682756 Plague, monsters, and wonders are all connected. Kill one, and the rest will suffer, too. Is my goal worth the sacrifice?
6192355000682757 
6192355000682758 
6192355000682759 Father's inheritance was a question, not an answer. He never wanted me to become him—only understand what he understood.\n\nI do, now. And my choice will be mine.
6192355000683451 Commoner
6192355000689351 Muddy Water
6192355000694151 
6192355000694152 How can I help you, doctor?
6192355000694153 What are those sounds?
6192355000694154 House examination. Let me in.
6192355000694155 Everything is in order here. God's mercy.
6192355000694156 So let me in.
6192355000694157 What was that noise?
6192355000694158 What sounds?
6192355000694159 Upstairs. Second floor.
6192355000694160 Are you deaf?
6192355000694161 What for?
6192355000694162 Do I need to kick you?
6192355000694163 I heard odd sounds.
6192355000694164 It's a cat.
6192355000694165 I love cats. Can I come up and pet it?
6192355000694166 Step aside. Now!
6192355000694167 This is neighborly business, doctor. We don't need you here. Get the hint already.
6192355000694168 Fine. I'll send orderlies here, then. Would you rather deal with them?
6192355000694169 I said, move aside! Or else!
6192355000694170 Whatever.
6192355000695551 Concerned One
6192355000697551 They say the Inquisitor got arrested, or they'll catch her soon enough.\nIt's for the best. The army will protect us. I imagine the soldiers will be happy to get her. They've always hated these commissars.
6192355000697552 Why?
6192355000697553 It's not that simple to arrest her. The government gives her free rein.
6192355000697554 Who cares about them here? Authority comes from armed soldiers and a train with cannons. Have you <i>seen</i> those cannons?
6192355000697555 They're hard to miss.
6192355000697556 I haven't. I should take a look.
6192355000697557 They have bad blood from back in the days. Cats and dogs. The inquisition does everything its own way, interfering with the army's plans. They even countermand orders. The generals hate it.
6192355000697558 Small wonder…
6192355000697565 How goes the search for raw materials for your panacea, Burakh? Have you found the bulls? We can no longer wait.
6192355000697566 The aurochs is extinct.
6192355000697567 Why can't we?
6192355000697568 The Army is in town, if you haven't noticed.
6192355000697569 What do they want?
6192355000697570 They have orders to level the Town. Mine are to eliminate the source of the outbreak, while preserving the Town. So their arrival is my death sentence. And I cannot stop them.\nThis brings us back to the subject of the panacea.
6192355000697571 I got no new ideas.
6192355000697572 What should we do, then?
6192355000697573 I got no new ideas.
6192355000697574 …And I was counting on you. Thought you were our best bet. Very well. It's good at least one of us still has their wits about them. I have an idea, thanks to Dankovsky.
6192355000697575 Did he make his vaccine?
6192355000697576 No, but he drew my eye toward that impossible structure. He's in love with it, I think. Particularly with how it stands straight without touching the ground. And is impenetrable to the disease.
6192355000697577 So what?
6192355000697578 Yes. The disease is tied to the Earth.
6192355000697579 Do you know how that Tower was made? Why it exists? The meaning behind its shape?\nThat is all I have been studying recently. And I have found many enlightening facts.
6192355000697580 It was built while I was away. But I know the local kids have set up quarters there.
6192355000697581 The Kains invited some mad architects from the Capital. To challenge the limits of possibility one more time.
6192355000697582 I have no idea what it's made of… They say over two hundred kids and teens live there. How does it stand?
6192355000697583 It was built something like six years ago.
6192355000697584 Precisely. Meaning…?
6192355000697585 I don't know.
6192355000697586 I was told you were seized by the soldiers.
6192355000697587 They wouldn't dare. For now.
6192355000697588 I don't think they ever will.
6192355000697589 Let Bad Grief go, will you? What do you need him for? I can vouch for him.
6192355000697590 Grief came to me of his own volition, and no one is doing anything to him. We have more pressing matters.
6192355000697591 Such as?
6192355000697592 I'll have proof soon. And my intuition has never failed me before. Except for this one time, with you… Still, I do not lose hope. The game isn't over, yet.
6192355000697593 Still, how are they connected?
6192355000697594 I'm flattered. Only that this game of yours is my whole life. Am I free to go?
6192355000697595 Somehow, Burakh. If the impossible suddenly becomes possible, someone must have paid a steep price indeed. The cost of such feats is usually measured in blood.
6192355000697596 Blood… Well, yeah. Blood, blood… I keep searching for it. I know this all has to do with blood.
6192355000697597 If there's blood, there's a panacea. If there's a panacea, I'll have reason to silence the cannons. I'll report that the disease has been cured.\nI'll be saved, too, but that hardly matters… The <i>Town</i> will be saved.
6192355000697598 All right. I'll go, now.
6192355000697599 Just… leave Grief alone, okay? He's a decent man. Better than most.
6192355000697600 I'm happy to see you weren't actually arrested.
6192355000697601 I'm so happy you're still alive! Are you looking for shelter, too? But you can't hide in the Cathedral. Only in the Tower. Or <i>on</i> the Tower, anyway…
6192355000697602 What the hell are you doing here?
6192355000697603 Everyone is gathering in the Tower. Me… I'm mustering up the resolve to follow. It's not easy… I'm very scared of heights.
6192355000697604 Who is gathering in the Tower?
6192355000697605 All the Town's children. Bit by bit… The Tower accepts kids, you know. It will protect us.\nThey're on the stairs now.
6192355000697606 So you all crossed an infected district? You're nuts!
6192355000697607 Why the hell did you abandon your houses?! Why did I even bother to take care of you?
6192355000697609 No grown-ups allowed up there.
6192355000697611 This place is dangerous.
6192355000697612 It's dangerous for you. But not for us.
6192355000697614 My kids are up ahead. Let me through.
6192355000697615 Thousands of parents have asked that, standing right where you're at.\nThe answer is no. No grown-ups allowed. Or it will all fall down.
6192355000697616 If you keep arguing with me, I'll fall down myself. From the disease. Is that what you want?
6192355000697617 What do you mean? Inside? You wouldn't understand. And honestly, neither do we.
6192355000697618 Why are you all here?
6192355000697619 We're scared of the cannon. And we're afraid for the Tower.\nIf they start firing, it could collapse, you know. Or fall. Or rip apart. Basically, it can die.
6192355000697620 It it falls, it won't be because of me. Let me through!
6192355000698352 It is the inquisitor's orders…
6192355000698353 …To come to her immediately, without delay. What a surprise.
6192355000698354 Not now. I have patients! My… my children.
6192355000698355 It's not up for discussion, Burakh. We'll take you there by force, if need be.
6192355000698356 …
6192355000698357 Let's go.
6192355000698358 I'll come on my own.
6192355000698359 Such a charming woman. Really knows how to win people over.
6192355000698360 I'm on my way there anyway. My… wards are there. If they've really spent the night on that staircase.
6192355000698361 Don't ask me how they achieved it. The Polyhedron's foundation pierces many meters into the ground beneath the Town, to its very heart. It's like the barb of an arrow stuck in a wound…\nWhy have you grown pale all of a sudden?
6192355000698362 How… how do you even know about the heart? I only confirmed its existence several hours ago.
6192355000698363 I think you're overworked, sweetheart.
6192355000698364 I know it sounds mad. But the blood of aurochs might be underground. And lots of it.
6192355000698366 I see. Explain. Briefly—but don't omit crucial details. Get to the point.
6192355000698367 A certain kind of bull used to be dissected in the Abattoir. The blood was poured underground for many centuries, as a ritual.
6192355000698380 We have a solution now. A clever one of which I'm particularly proud.\nSo. You may not have saved my life, but you did help me save my professional honor. Intuition never fails me. But I'll need to get proof. Otherwise, they'll refuse to demolish that wretched edifice.
6192355000698382 How do you plan to demolish it? Finding workers in these conditions…

6192355000700653 The Polyhedron defies the law of gravity. But it's still connected to the Earth. Everything is.
6192355000700654 
6192355000700655 
6192355000700656 The Polyhedron is the best possible isolation ward. Sand Pest, which comes from Earth, can't reach it.
6192355000702451 Something's going on with Aglaya.
6192355000702452 Children are gathering atop the Polyhedron.
6192355000702453 
6192355000702454 
6192355000702455 The sand pest defies its own rules. It took all of my wards, and it drags them towards death.
6192355000702456 
6192355000702457 
6192355000702458 To make the panacea, I require an underground river of blood. The Polyhedron's spike wounded Earth like an arrow and clogs the wound. Remove it, and blood will flow. But that which is wounded will die.\n\nA difficult decision awaits me.

6192355000702466 
6192355000702467 
6192355000702468 Save my wards at any cost. Antibiotics. Shmowders. Last vials of panacea…\n\nAnything to keep them alive. It'll all be over soon.

6192355000710086 You speak of authority, but it's a yoke. It will enslave me, esegher.
6192355000710087 No. Not yet. Too early.
6192355000710088 Why is that?
6192355000710089 So those were crocodile tears.
6192355000710090 …Are you calling me a crocodile?
6192355000710091 I don't mean your <i>appearance.</i>
6192355000710092 Your teeth look plenty sharp to me.
6192355000710093 Our responsibility is not to the Town, but to the world at large, currently kept safe by your quarantine. And those people won't stay in the Town, they'll scatter. They're not attached to this land.
6192355000710094 You are wrong. They are strongly connected to it.
6192355000710095 Land—Earth—is the one thing they are attached to. Let them go.
6192355000710096 I'll think about it. But I won't believe the Olgimskys' assurances any longer. And who else could give me those? You? What's their word… "emshen"?
6192355000710097 Perhaps it <i>will</i> be me.
6192355000710098 They will not leave this steppe.
6192355000710104 We are happy that you understand.
6192355000710105 I think you should <i>all</i> go to the old village. What's the name… Shekhen? What's holding you here?
6192355000711874 Are we whole again? Yes, we hear it. We are whole again.
6192355000711875 I hope so. Go to Shekhen. Let twyre part before you.
6192355000711876 Did you accept your power over us? Are you our father now?
6192355000711877 Ugh… Aren't you tired of asking?
6192355000711878 I have, by killing those poor souls. You forced my hand.
6192355000711880 It was more interesting when you were different.
6192355000711881 Care isn't about power or violence, you fools. I'll show you one day.
6192355000711892 They need to leave that place. I've already asked the woman from the Capital to unlock the gate. She has the power now. But she refused me, and so will she refuse you.
6192355000711893 So you two have met?
6192355000711894 She didn't refuse me.
6192355000711895 Yes. I've talked to anyone who has power.
6192355000711896 Do you?
6192355000711897 I do. My power comes from the Olgimskys, and from Earth. But those are only scraps.\nThe Kin can be ruled by either force or spirit. Your father did the latter. I do the former. Boös Vlad's strength is behind me.
6192355000711898 They want to see him, by the way. Olgimsky.
6192355000711899 How is that possible? You have no such power. You have no such authority!
6192355000711900 Do you?
6192355000711901 I prefer Father's way, then.
6192355000711902 That's their right. If I were in Olgimsky's place, I'd come. How else will they remember who their master is?\nIf he acts as a master would, with no fear, with no doubt in his power, then they will submit to him again. As animals do.
6192355000711903 You think this will be the end of it?
6192355000711904 Who knows. Whatever happens, Master will get what he deserves. If he's strong enough, he'll restore his power. If not… well, he'll lose it forever. This is his trial. 
6192355000711905 I'll remember your words, Kindred.
6192355000711906 You're smarter than people give you credit for.
6192355000717267 Someone's here. From Olgimsky. They want to talk to you. Don't worry—there's no danger.
6192355000717268 Why would I worry…?
6192355000717269 Olgimsky… I wonder how he found out I was here…
6192355000717270 To hell with it. I don't want to see anyone. Except you, of course.
6192355000717271 You're probably off to a pub now… to drink to your father's memory? The twyrine poison flows wide in The Broken Heart… Stamatin runs a good business… While I allow it…
6192355000717272 A pub? Perhaps. Beats staying here.
6192355000717273 I don't drink. Not now.
6192355000717275 I'll just go wherever legs carry me.
6192355000717276 There's a gleam of goodness in your eyes, my friend. Drink with me.
6192355000717277 There's wickedness in my eyes. 
6192355000717278 I don't drink.
6192355000717279 All right.
6192355000717280 Everyone says twyrine heightens the senses, but I think that's only true of hearing. Vision—no, you won't see anything new. It isn't absinthe. No smells, either. This place reeks of herbs as it is. Hearing, though…
6192355000717281 What about hearing?
6192355000717282 Just drink, and you'll hear how the Town sounds. You'll hear who's calling you, and from where. You'll hear a murmur from afar… Perhaps from across the Gorkhon. Or perhaps from across the Styx itself… \nDrink to my health, friend. This is excellent twyrine.
6192355000717283 There's no such thing as bad twyrine.
6192355000717284 Twyrine's a dangerous liquor. Who knows where it might lure you.
6192355000717285 I can afford this kind of joy.
6192355000717286 So what do you do?
6192355000717287 You don't exactly look rich.
6192355000717288 I was once an architect. Now I'm just a… shadow of an architect.
6192355000717289 Thanks for the drink, friend.
6192355000717290 Likewise. Only I used to be a doctor.
6192355000717291 Twyrine doesn't heighten hearing. It just dampens all the other senses.
6192355000717292 My name is Peter. I am the rock upon which is built the stairway to tomorrow. To the day when man lifts himself from the earth and overcomes its burden. \nI am that rock. And I have already built the first step of that stairway. For I am a true architect.
6192355000717293 And I'm Artemy Burakh. Let's drink to my father's memory. A good man.
6192355000717294 I think you've had enough, Peter.
6192355000717295 Drink, Burakh, drink your twyrine. Listen to the world. Listen to the roar of the terrible earth. Listen to the ringing of the sky. Listen to the Town opening for you. \nYou'll find out where people wait for you. Or whispering about you right now. It's been proven to work.
6192355000717296 I'll check.
6192355000717297 Thank you for the valuable gift. I'll return the favor if I get a chance.
6192355000717298 The rabble is out of control! At least they <i>looked</i> human before. Did you hear about the stabbings? There's people with knives out in the streets now, brother!
6192355000717299 That's impossible. Stabbings don't happen here.
6192355000717300 Yeah… At first I didn't believe my own eyes.
6192355000717301 I mean, I'm quite an artist with the knife, myself… but that's different! Everyone knows I obey no law. \nThese people, there's no wholesome fear left in them. Kniving is taboo around here! That's why I loved this town. But you know the tricks of the trade, don't you? I can tell by your hands.
6192355000717302 I'm a surgeon. It's part of my job.
6192355000717303 It's a family thing.
6192355000717304 I'm no rogue.
6192355000717305 You're a dangerous man. I'm a dangerous man, too. We can reach an understanding if you behave yourself in my establishment.
6192355000717306 Those people with knives… Are they still trying to avenge Burakh?
6192355000717307 Do they think night conceals everything?
6192355000717308 I don't even care. If they come here, they'll regret it. He who lives by the knife, dies by the knife! Such people are outlaws. Killing them incurs no punishment, only gratitude. Judge Kain said so.
6192355000717309 That's fair. Only a butcher has the right to cut flesh.
6192355000717310 Judge Kain… Do you mean old Georgiy? That means it's serious.
6192355000717311 Ah, my fellow traveler! I suspect this is not the last time we chat.
6192355000717312 I recognize you… So you're a merchant?
6192355000717313 I… dabble in buying and selling. But I've no use for coins, though I often find I have two to rub together.\nI collect things. Things that are old, broken, discarded. Dead items. Memories, husks, and husks of memories… "traces," as I call them.
6192355000717314 So you're a rag-and-bone man?
6192355000717321 Shall we play dice?
6192355000717324 Too late. The bones have been cast already.
6192355000717325 You were planning to visit Father, too. Did you find him?
6192355000717326 I did, of course. As soon as I arrived.
6192355000717327 I hope you found him in good health.
6192355000717328 You kidding me? If only!
6192355000717329 What do you sell, fellow traveler? Picking over the Town's bones?
6192355000717330 What do you sell?
6192355000717331 So you were luckier than I was.
6192355000717332 It's good work. When a rag-and-bone man does the rounds, no door stays shut… Who keeps useless junk? Everyone's happy to see me. \nEveryone trusts me. It makes for a peaceful harvest.
6192355000717333 Aren't you afraid of being out at night?
6192355000717334 What use do you have for that junk?
6192355000717335 I just like it when things are tidy. If I don't, people leave things behind, evidence of their passage… a mess. Won't do. Better to take those things into my bag.
6192355000717336 An unpleasant occupation.
6192355000717337 All right, let's see what you barter for.
6192355000717338 I <i>only</i> work nights. It's a ripe time. \nDoes it frighten me? No. Nor should it frighten you. The Town changes each night, turns into a different place to explore. What was open during the day closes… and what was closed, opens.
6192355000717339 I have no fear. Only insomnia.
6192355000717340 Good luck with that…
6192355000717341 Happy to make your acquaintance. You'll get a lot of… "traces" from me, I'm sure.
6192355000718251 Done that already.
6192355000718252 Three poisoned patients are in a warehouse we used to play in when we were kids. They seem to require medical help.
6192355000718253 
6192355000718254 Time moves forward while I sleep. This way, I may skip some events. \n\nOn the other hand, if I have nothing to do, sleeping is a good way to move things forward.
6192355000724251 The clinking of dice can be heard here.
6192355000724252 I can sleep at Lara's until evening, if I want to. Or I could wander the Town.
6192355000724253 I'm done with everything important for today. I'm free to rest until tomorrow... or explore the town. At night, its face changes.
6192355000724254 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355000724255 
6192355000724256 I can drink to Father's memory in the Broken Heart.
6192355000724257 I can gather my strength in The Broken Heart.
6192355000724258 I can drink to Father's memory in the Broken Heart.
6192355000724259 
6192355000724260 No one would condemn me for killing bandits at night. I might even be rewarded. Hm…
6192355000724261 No one would condemn me for killing bandits at night. I might even be rewarded. Hm…
6192355000724262 What a twist. I robbed the Soul-and-a-Halves of their revenge… but somehow they're thankful for this.
6192355000724263 Twyrine uncovers that which is hidden. Every sip will reveal a secret event or location to me.
6192355000724479 What play is it?
6192355000724482 I'm not a theatregoer. Never understood the appeal.
6192355000724483 It's about death. Hot on its trail, so to speak.\nI've already tried to stage this study once, but it didn't work out. The acting was bad. No one understood what they were playing. How can you be a Kain, a Burakh, or Sinister Katerina if you don't walk their paths? No one grasped their character.\nThis time it will be different.
6192355000724484 What do you mean?
6192355000724485 They used to act out old steppe rites here when I was a kid…
6192355000724486 I want full authenticity. I will move the play outside, into the streets.\nActors play out real events while being in the middle of them. The audience doesn't know they're in a play. The actors, that they're being watched. Such is my method…
6192355000724490 We have a ton of steppe theatre costumes in the storeroom. Especially those wicked birds, Muu Shubuun. The ones that symbolize death. Do steppe people like the play with death?
6192355000724491 Not really. They just have a different attitude toward it.
6192355000724492 Muu Shubuun is not a mask of death. It's actually more about life.
6192355000724493 Conversations like this make my head hurt.
6192355000725051 Every night, an odd performance is held in the Theatre.
6192355000730451 ???
6192355000730453 
6192355000730454 This potion was made from infected flesh. I've added several active components to a bacterial culture, and hopefully got a medicine capable of suppressing the microbe. It's time to put the theory to test.
6192355000730851 You're quite the sleeper, human.
6192355000730852 …I shouldn't have gone to bed at all.
6192355000730853 I need to rest.
6192355000730854 Exactly. You'll sleep your whole life away, if you're not careful. "Time and tide tarry for no man," remember? Quality proverb.
6192355000730855 This isn't life.
6192355000730856 Life is a dream.
6192355000730857 While you dream, the Town lives. Someone out there waits for you, this very moment. Perhaps they wait in vain. Is my hint clear? Don't be surprised if you wake up and find every train has left the Station.
6192355000730858 I'm not easily shaken, little critter. See, here I am, talking to you like all this is normal.
6192355000730859 No one waits for me, not here.
6192355000731151 The infected districts are off limits to anyone but medical personnel. Doctor Dankovsky's orders… Are you that Vorakh guy?
6192355000731152 Burakh. He sure has memory issues, doesn't he?
6192355000731153 Oh, this place is infected? I'll be on my way, then.
6192355000731154 Immune boosters, two pills. Protective clothes, one unit. Here you go. And God save you.
6192355000731155 Pills… Well, I guess it's better than nothing.
6192355000731156 Clothes? Does that fop think fleas transmit the disease? It's not a plague! I suppose, though, you can't be too careful…
6192355000731157 So, does it work now?
6192355000731158 The alembic? It does.
6192355000731159 What about the big one?
6192355000731160 I'll fix it, too.
6192355000731161 Would you like me to look for scrap metal? What do you need to fix it? Cogs and stuff?
6192355000731162 I'll need a special toolkit for it.
6192355000731163 Only one of them.
6192355000731164 I don't know yet.
6192355000731165 I'll find the components myself.
6192355000734051 What is this girl doing here?
6192355000734052 How should I know?
6192355000734053 This is Grace. She's the cemetery caretaker.
6192355000734054 Forget it. Do you have any immunity boosters?
6192355000734055 I do.
6192355000734056 I don't.
6192355000734057 Where's that… artist?
6192355000734058 He's an architect, and I have no idea. I came here for him, not the girl…
6192355000734059 Damn it! Why do they keep going outside? Do they want to get infected?
6192355000734060 She needs medicine. In an infected district, everyone's in danger. Immunity boosters can help.
6192355000734061 I know. I'll take care of her.
6192355000734072 What do you want? Don't touch me! Stay away!
6192355000734073 I'm not touching you.
6192355000734074 Quiet now… I'm a doctor.
6192355000734075 I should have left this god-forsaken place two years ago. Get clean and move away for good. But I have no spine. I'm not a real man. Cannot leave her behind.
6192355000734076 Leave whom behind?
6192355000734077 The Judge wanted me to check on you.
6192355000735951 If you're here, then so is he. Good. I'll tell the others. There's only four of us here; we'll need to call for help.
6192355000735952 What are you doing here?
6192355000735953 You should leave, Khatanghe. No good will come of you being here.
6192355000735954 He's not here.
6192355000735955 You're a bad liar, Khatangher. It is unbecoming. We will not lie to you. We will call for help.
6192355000735956 That leaves me no choice. I'll have to use lethal force.
6192355000735957 It's good to know there are only four of you. And all separated, too.
6192355000735958 I wait. Taste the air. We plan on leaving already. Thought we were mistaken. But he <i>is</i> here, after all. Your presence confirms it.
6192355000735959 I confirm nothing.
6192355000735960 He's not here. I'm looking for him, just like you.
6192355000735961 He's in the Termitary.
6192355000735962 That Stakh Rubin, akhar, your father's false student. You know him. Tell me what he does at night.
6192355000735963 I can tell you what ho doesn't do: sleep. As far as I can tell.
6192355000735964 I barely know him.
6192355000735965 "False"? He was a very loyal student. Went overboard even.
6192355000735966 Tell me, what does he do during the night? Where does he hide?
6192355000735967 Why do you care?
6192355000735968 Ask him yourself. During the day, he's in the hospital, working.
6192355000735969 Good question...
6192355000735970 He has no respect for the dead. No respect for the body. He cuts bodies open without grace. He knows not the Lines.\nHe's an outsider.
6192355000735971 Precisely. Outsiders have no obligation to honor our traditions.
6192355000735972 For what it's worth, I'm an outsider too.
6192355000735973 The khatanghe are worried. Your friend is doing evil. The blame, as always, will be pinned to us. And we are dwindling by the hour as it is. Mere hundreds left now.
6192355000735974 Unente... don't tell me. I know.
6192355000735975 I think... Actually, disregard that. I don't think anything.
6192355000735976 I'll take care of him. He's my friend, after all. Not yours.
6192355000735977 He won't say. And we don't have time.\nHe needs to be stopped. Fast. Very fast.
6192355000735978 Why?
6192355000735979 You're right. Otherwise he might die from exhaustion.
6192355000735980 I'm curious now. What <i>does</i> he do at night...?
6192355000738051 
6192355000738052 
6192355000738053 Father's contraption is out of order. I'll need a chunk of metal scrap and a good spring to fix it.
6192355000738054 
6192355000738055 
6192355000738056 The second contraption needs serious repair. It requires a toolkit. \n\nI haven't seen one around these days. I'll look for it later.
6192355000738251 
6192355000738651 
6192355000738652 
6192355000738663 
6192355000739551 Came here to have some fun, sawbones? Plague is a time for feasts.
6192355000739552 So, I hear you're an architect?
6192355000739751 
6192355000739752 
6192355000739753 Complex mixtures are brewed in the big alembic, but it's broken. It requires a toolkit to fix.\n\nTime to deal with this issue.
6192355000739754 
6192355000739755 
6192355000739756 I've fixed the big alembic. Now I can brew more complex medicine.
6192355000739757 
6192355000739758 
6192355000739759 By mixing water and herbs, I can make an immunity booster. Unsurprisingly, it boosts immunity. \n\nSurprisingly, it also reveals symptoms of diseases.
6192355000739760 
6192355000739761 
6192355000739762 Immunity protects one's health in infected districts. I should keep it high. Protective clothes also help.
6192355000739763 
6192355000739764 
6192355000739765 
6192355000739766 
6192355000739767 
6192355000739768 Immunity protects health is infected districts. As do clothes.
6192355000739769 
6192355000739770 
6192355000739771 Immunity protects health in infected districts. As do clothes.
6192355000739772 
6192355000739773 
6192355000739774 
6192355000739775 
6192355000739776 
6192355000739777 If I give an immunity booster to an inhabitant of an infected district, they have a higher chance to avoid infection.\n\n<b>I can't guarantee anyone full protection.</b> But I can rig this in my favor.
6192355000739778 Peter Stamatin isn't home, but I should still check if everything's all right here.
6192355000740151 Blood-Kin
6192355000740152 This is our blөөd, tangher. Little of it left here, inside. Six springs. Six gulps. We will not allow үүou to drink our blөөd.
6192355000740153 I'm getting exhausted.
6192355000740154 Bite kharaan, it is so. Yes. For you are not like us.
6192355000740155 I'm human.
6192355000740156 But we are beasts. We are Worms. Do you know that we are Worms within Earth?
6192355000740157 Whose blood is it, Khatangher?
6192355000740158 It's Mother Boddho's blөөd. She feeds us with her breast. Listen.\nCan үүou hear the pulse? This is the pulse of her veins, akhar.
6192355000740159 You're an akhar! To you, I'm an emshen.
6192355000740160 Give me a sip.
6192355000741151 
6192355000741152 
6192355000741162 
6192355000741172 Go ahead. Tie it together.
6192355000741173 Tie what together?
6192355000741174 You ask me? The ones that fit together. A menkhu sees the connections between.
6192355000741175 It doesn't take exceptional wisdom to see connections.

6192355000743253 
6192355000743451 You are too quick, kind sir! You pace ahead of schedule like a man possessed. Let's see: The next event of consequence is set to come into your life… Tonight. Later.
6192355000743452 So what now? I guess I could get some sleep?
6192355000743453 How can you tell which events are of consequence?
6192355000743454 Thanks for the warning, pal.
6192355000743455 Why sleep? So much to do! So little time! \nIf you can find an hour or two to spare, then make the most you can of precious time. For bitter Fate demands that you prepare: Explore the town and fill your pockets, quick! Your time is short, and no one knows what tide tomorrow brings.
6192355000743456 Oh, I know. An ill tide.
6192355000743457 Fair advice.
6192355000743458 I was a fortune-teller's own assistant. Though some thought him a fraud, I saw behind the curtain, awed at all I witnessed there.\nSo trust me when I say: There's time enough for you, Burakh. For now, at least, there's time.
6192355000743459 So do I just sit around and nap until evening?
6192355000745253 I am happy I got to meet you, Burakh. You are a very special person.
6192355000745254 I'm not, not really.
6192355000745255 Why have we stopped?
6192355000745256 Stay here. I'll go out and check.
6192355000745257 You are wrong. We belong to different worlds.
6192355000745258 Move aside.
6192355000745259 What do you want?
6192355000745260 There are no infected people among us. You're free to go, doctor. Return to the Town.
6192355000745261 What for…?
6192355000745264 I think… all these plague days have been leading to me doing something like this.\nI've been accused of all sorts of crimes—but I was innocent. There were rumors that I was a looter, that I walked around with a revolver killing people. I guess… I had to prove them right.
6192355000745265 Did <i>you</i> do it?
6192355000745268 That was a sobering experience. Don't you think so?
6192355000745269 I guess.
6192355000745274 Take pity on us, essegher. Kill not our mother.
6192355000745280 …I need only <i>technically</i> execute the order. All I need is a precise target designated by the state commissar. If I have that, I can legally spare the Town.\nThank this girl. She promised me the epidemic wouldn't spread past the Town. And I believe her.
6192355000745281 You mean… her? The Changeling?
6192355000747051 ???
6192355000752051 Burakh's Tagloor
6192355000752075 
6192355000752076 
6192355000753451 You brought him. Good. Now you will become responsible for us. \nFat Vlad was a bad master. You'll be better. You'll care for us with your life, listen to Boddho's will, listen to Suok's chant, do what we will.
6192355000753452 Power is a curse. Find someone else to rule you. Like Oyun.
6192355000753453 Fine. I will become your father. I will take care of my people. I promise.
6192355000753461 Be khara, these are the right words. You truly do know the Lines, emshen.
6192355000753462 I kept my word. I brought you Olgimsky. Now let the girl go.
6192355000753463 Didn't we tell you she can't be cut away from us?\nDo you fear for her? We'll take her with us to Shekhen as soon as we can. Neither the Town nor the sand pest can touch us there.
6192355000753464 Then go. The Olgimskys have no power over you anymore.
6192355000753465 Why are you still here, then? I'll speak to the inquisitor on your behalf. I'll let her know you're only going to Shekhen, not further.
6192355000753466 Some of us reject your authority. They hate you. They blame you, your father, for everything. They'll never accept you. \nWe can't leave this place torn asunder. Kill them, so that we may be whole again.
6192355000753467 Kill? Aren't you all one body?
6192355000753468 I'm not killing anyone.
6192355000753469 I don't want to carry you. Wouldn't a good father leave it to you?
6192355000753470 Do as you will. We don't care. We can't leave this place split. We can't start a new life torn apart.
6192355000753471 So where are the crazed ones?
6192355000753473 We will lock ourselves in our rooms now, preparing. The disloyal ones will keep wandering about, skulking in the shadows with their plots.\nWe'll open the doors again when the schism is no more. And then we'll go to Shekhen.
6192355000753474 I see.
6192355000753475 Blackmail…
6192355000753476 Numerous, they are. We have no weapons. But you know the Lines.
6192355000753477 Lines make for a lousy weapon.
6192355000753478 Where are those apostates of yours?
6192355000753479 You've got the wrong man. The other Olgimsky is to blame. This man only came to protect him.
6192355000753551 I rise. No one can stop me now. And you can do nothing against me. I am taking them all.
6192355000753552 Who?
6192355000753553 All in your care. All you care for.\nThey wish it, you know. Worry not. Children have better odds than grown men. Much better.
6192355000753554 Why?
6192355000753555 I come to teach the folk how to overcome death. And children are the most striking of your kind. They can do more than their mothers and fathers.
6192355000753557 You're not omnipotent. I have a weapon against you.
6192355000753558 You have no weapon. You mean your "panacea," all-heal, yes? What good is such a draught in a world bereft of the stuff to craft it? Wonders flee this world, Burakh. I am one of dwindling few. You fail to ken it yet.
6192355000753559 They do. They're leaking out. But I know what that flow comes from, now.
6192355000753560 I have heard such before.
6192355000753561 Even children managed to make a cure for you. Five years ago. "Schmowders…"
6192355000753562 Indeed? You are welcome to seek them out. But I reckon you will find no children in the streets these days.\nKnow you the newest tidings, man of fog? Lend me an ear, then, to what I tell you!
6192355000753563 I will save some. At least that. To prove you're not all-powerful.
6192355000753564 A doctor's victory isn't about saving everyone, but about creating a cure. Which I have.
6192355000753565 Everyone on my list will survive. I remember my duty.

6192355000754258 What matters is that you understood something.
6192355000754259 But did I understand what was most important?
6192355000754751 
6192355000754752 
6192355000754753 Oyun must know about the Termitary.
6192355000754754 
6192355000754755 
6192355000754756 Oyun is a shepherd of bulls. He is convinced the Kin can only be dragged to salvation by force.
6192355000754757 
6192355000754758 
6192355000754759 
6192355000754760 
6192355000754761 
6192355000754762 
6192355000754763 
6192355000754764 There is a schism in the Kin. Apostates run rampant in the Termitary. To restore the Kin, the gangrene must be cut off. Or can I heal it?
6192355000754765 
6192355000754766 
6192355000754767 The apostates have been pacified. Time to speak with the Kin.

6192355000755051 Messenger
6192355000758251 Are you sad that I went off to the friend of mine? Don't be! It all happened for a reason. I died so that I could tell you three things. I think you need to know them.
6192355000758252 What three things?
6192355000758253 Have you... died?
6192355000758254 I'm so sorry, kid.
6192355000758255 This place is very sad, but not too scary. Lonely, though. But that's fine, I guess. I used to be sad and lonely in life too. So it's not that big a change.
6192355000758256 You sound more adult.
6192355000758257 I miss you so much.
6192355000758258 Forgive me...
6192355000758259 Listen to me, please. This is important. What if someone wakes you up now and we never meet again?
6192355000758260 I'm listening.
6192355000758261 Item one. The sand pest is closely connected to the earth. So it's actually dangerous to touch her. And if she's cured, you might actually hurt the earth.
6192355000758262 Got it. Next one?
6192355000758263 Item two. Everyone thinks it's a calamity, like a hurricane or an earthquake. That we're just unlucky. But it happened for a reason. The outbreak has a cause. Someone unleashed her on purpose.
6192355000758264 Who would do that?
6192355000758265 Was it a human?
6192355000758266 What was the reason?
6192355000758267 I don't know. She won't tell. My friend doesn't talk to me much anymore now... and doesn't know anything... I thought she would be more interesting. Will you listen to item three?
6192355000758268 Of course. Go on.
6192355000758269 Item three is this. Everyone thinks she kills whoever she touches. Hah! She'd love that! But in truth, some people don't succumb to her. That makes her teeth-grindingly angry!
6192355000758270 Who doesn't succumb to it?
6192355000758271 What does it depend on?
6192355000758272 So it is evil after all?
6192355000758273 I don't know... it's for you to find out.
6192355000758274 How?
6192355000758275 Can I fix all this?
6192355000758276 Could I have saved you?
6192355000758277 What did you think? Of course she is.
6192355000758278 What am I supposed to do now, Murky?
6192355000758279 I could have prevented this, couldn't I?
6192355000758280 Just... connect to people more. If you talked to me more often, I wouldn't be here. \nYour touch is different from hers. Yours are nice. You're a doctor, after all. You know how to connect what is broken.
6192355000758281 Will I dream of you again?
6192355000758282 I don't know... Come on, turn that frown upside down! Just pay more attention to the people in your care. Especially Sticky. He's very devoted to you.
6192355000758283 It's I who should be comforting you...
6192355000758284 Forgive me.
6192355000758285 I'll try.

6192355000761057 Father was killed by Foreman Oyun.
6192355000761058 
6192355000761059 
6192355000761060 
6192355000761061 Oyun is here.
6192355000761062 
6192355000761063 
6192355000761064 Let Oyun live. I looked him in the eye and forgave him, but he will never forgive himself. Now his life is emptiness and torment.
6192355000761065 Oyun got his just deserts. All is fair. All is as it should be.\n\nAny choice is right, as long as it's willed.
6192355000764351 Soldier
6192355000764352 Soldier
6192355000764359 Which side are you on?
6192355000764360 Ours.
6192355000765151 I didn't bother with the issues of children.
6192355000765152 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355000765153 Bad Grief is no longer waiting for me.
6192355000765154 I did not look for Rubin.
6192355000765155 The Town Hall is no longer looking for me.
6192355000766251 Бунтовщик
6192355000766258 Name?
6192355000766260 Artemy Burakh, doctor. Where's General Block?
6192355000766261 The general is sick. The provisional executive officer is Captain Longin.
6192355000766262 I'm a doctor. Let me examine the general.
6192355000766263 General Block is out sick. Captain Longin is now in charge of the quarantine measures. You can try your luck with him when he's back.
6192355000766264 How did he manage to catch it, I wonder? He was here, in the headquarters! There was no plague around here yesterday. And it needs at least a day before it shows…
6192355000767251 Filling. Soldiers take these to the front so that their death comes from a bullet rather than starvation.
6192355000767252 General Block never wanted to come to this town, but it's a soldier's duty to follow orders… Isn't it?
6192355000767253 Satisfies a little hunger, but is it worth the risk?
6192355000767254 Rotten Food
6192355000767255 Meat? Bread? Vegetables? Can't tell. Plague makes everyone—and everything—equal.
6192355000767256 Candy Wrapper
6192355000767257 A colorful piece of paper. Useless.
6192355000767258 A blurry blue spot in the corner could either be an official seal, or a trace of dissolved candy.
6192355000767259 Quenches a little thirst, but is it worth the risk? I can't craft tinctures with it.
6192355000767260 Why did I collect this?
6192355000767261 Button
6192355000767262 A trifle to a human, but a whole eye to a doll.
6192355000767263 Murky is said to have a doll, but no one's ever seen it. Perhaps it simply lives all over the Town?
6192355000767264 Cotton Wool
6192355000767265 Looks like stuffing of some sort.
6192355000767266 In the wide world, a surgeon's best friend, but back here, people take surgery less seriously, and disinfectant is mostly taken by mouth.
6192355000767267 An herbal infusion. Drink to reveal events and places hidden from the naked eye.
6192355000767268 The Town calls to me. But it's hard to hear over my own thoughts. If I quiet them down, I can sense the pulse of life all over the Town.
6192355000768951 Aglaya needs to have a serious talk with me.
6192355000768952 
6192355000768953 
6192355000768954 
6192355000768955 
6192355000768956 
6192355000768957 Aglaya's mission is complete. She's doomed to die here. But she only wants to flee this hell if it's with me.\n\nI accepted. We'll meet tonight at the Station.
6192355000768958 Aglaya's mission is complete. She suggested we flee.\n\nAbsurd. I have children. I have the Town. I'm not going anywhere.
6192355000770251 sdfsdf\n\ndf\nwer\n
6192355000770353 Well, mine was just murdered! My brother's, too! Murdered in cold blood!\nThat Tower was alive! Alive! And there won't ever be another one like it! Ever! Even Brother won't make one! Even I won't build one on this sorry earth! Do you understand? Do you?!
6192355000770354 I do! Stop yelling at me.
6192355000770355 I just want someone to pick me up and hold me.
6192355000770356 I thought you hated being touched.
6192355000770357 
6192355000770358 
6192355000770359 
6192355000770360 
6192355000770361 Ukhedel… Earth is cold… My feet are cold… I'm going deaf, blind. My hands are rough. Boleesh, boleesh, byy alysh…
6192355000770362 What's wrong with you, khetey?
6192355000770375 And not just mine. Back in Thanatica, we fought for life. For the right to live. For a chance to… to never let death <i>veto</i> people. That's what we were robbed of.\nThis tower… Ah, what is there to say. It's gone. And so is hope.
6192355000770376 I understand it's hard for you.
6192355000770377 Ne'er been up here. Can you imagine?
6192355000770378 What do you plan to do now?
6192355000770379 No, my boy… Life's not over yet. Not over. It only looks broken… but we will start anew. We will rebuild it…
6192355000770380 The same as before?
6192355000770383 People always say it was Andrey and Peter who built this town, but that's not true. The Oneirotects did. And Nina and Victoria too, in their own way…\nAnd then there was Farkhad, another Oneirotect. He built the Cathedral.
6192355000770384 Many generations worked on this town before all the Andreys, Peters, and Farkhads came along.
6192355000770391 
6192355000770392 
6192355000770470 
6192355000770477 [a living heart of a giant creature]
6192355000770478 The Eighth.
6192355000770479 [it's beating… barely]
6192355000770480 Talk to me.
6192355000770481 …To me. [I've been talking to you this whole time.]
6192355000770482 You're the udurgh.
6192355000770483 …Udurgh. [I don't know this word.]
6192355000770484 You are the Town's heart, yes?
6192355000770485 You are the voice of Earth. No?
6192355000770486 Are Earth and the Town one and the same? Do you know?
6192355000770487 …No.
6192355000770488 Am I talking to myself again? I tend to do that. Yes…
6192355000770489 …Yes.
6192355000770490 The Town is alive.
6192355000770491 …Alive.
6192355000770492 You're just an echo.
6192355000770493 No. You're not just an echo.
6192355000771951 I feared this town might be a cradle. But it ended up being a catapult bucket.
6192355000771952 Is it time to take off?
6192355000771953 I suspect I'm the only person here who has figured out that you were the one who did it. A simple calculation, Burakh. Numbers never lie. And you know what? I can get behind what you've done. It was a fifty-fifty chance.\nTruthfully? I find it oddly inspiring. I'm no writer, but I'll write about you.
6192355000771954 Not a poem, I hope?
6192355000771955 Mother would have approved of my ideas. She loved people. I don't. But I do believe that, when treated with respect, they return it in spades.\nEconomic growth is based on human dignity. And "dignity" is a word that we haven't heard too often around these parts.
6192355000771956 Can you tell me more about your mother?
6192355000771957 I'm really very grateful to you, Artemy, for what you've done. You did everything right, guiding this town toward the future. I'll always be glad to return the favor however I can.
6192355000771958 You speak so politely… like we're strangers.
6192355000771959 My husband is no longer governor…
6192355000771960 I'm sorry for your loss.
6192355000771961 Oh. I was just wondering if you'd come.
6192355000771962 Well, here I am.
6192355000771963 Twenty-four… Thirty-three… Seven… Seven-and-five…
6192355000771964 How's it going, cub?
6192355000771965 …So beautiful.\nSometimes, stone seems useless. Anything is better than stone. Wax, silk, glass… Stone is for the tone-deaf. But occasionally, it shines—even in this crude configuration…
6192355000771966 Yes. Nina was very beautiful.
6192355000772151 Is this our new house?
6192355000772152 I guess. Do you like it?
6192355000772153 You know, old boy, I was never persecuted for my genius. Nor was I prosecuted for murder. And yet, it turns out <i>all this</i> was my hell after all.
6192355000772154 What do you mean?
6192355000772157 Waiting for your command, my Mentor.
6192355000772158 Joking? Good. Keep it up.
6192355000772159 Katerina is no longer a Mistress.
6192355000772160 I'm sorry for your loss.
6192355000772223 Medenegshe, I hereby grant you new law. \nOver your left hand it is done, not the right. So speaks Mother Boddho… Unsure <i>why</i> she speaks so, but still. We will tell hands apart, now. Tiimel daa.
6192355000772224 Preaching already, girl?
6192355000772490 Let us be quiet for a while.
6192355000772491 Sure.
6192355000772492 In the end, I'm glad it turned out this way. The Tower was a thorn in the side.
6192355000772493 Right on.
6192355000772496 So what's the plan now?
6192355000772497 What's left to do?
6192355000773151 
6192355000773152 
6192355000773153 …Farewell.
6192355000773154 
6192355000773155 
6192355000773156 Aglaya Lilich sent couriers with the orders to demolish the Polyhedron to Headquarters. Did they get there? I should check.
6192355000773157 Aglaya has ordered the Polyhedron to be demolished. The couriers with her orders will reach their headquarters in the morning.\n\nShould I make sure that they get there safely? Or that they don't…?
6192355000773158 
6192355000773159 
6192355000773160 
6192355000773161 The army leaves at 22:00. If they have the Inquisitor's orders, they'll make the shot. Otherwise, they'll likely just leave.
6192355000773162 
6192355000773163 
6192355000773164 The couriers are looking for General Block. He could be in any of the remaining zones of conflict.
6192355000776051 
6192355000776052 
6192355000776053 One courier died in a shootout.\n\nDemolish the Polyhedron. Spill rivers of blood. Make enough panacea for everyone. This is the only way to grant the Town a future.
6192355000776054 Anyone can be understood. Anyone can be forgiven. Even oneself…
6192355000776055 There's blood on your hands.
6192355000776056 
6192355000776057 
6192355000776058 One of the couriers was killed by Dankovsky. To save the Polyhedron. His reasons are his own. He doesn't know how the world works.\n\nBut… maybe the Polyhedron should survive? Maybe it deserves to?
6192355000776059 I've found a courier! But I need to cure him first… or rid of the thugs guarding him.
6192355000776060 
6192355000776061 
6192355000776062 One courier is still out there, bleeding.\n\nIf the papers reach General Block, Living Earth will die forever—along with all its wonders.
6192355000776063 
6192355000776064 
6192355000776065 The last courier is out in the Town. Where?\n\nAll this time, the Town whispered directions to me. But now it's silent. For the first time, I'll have to think for myself.
6192355000776066 The Army is leaving. I hold the last copy of the Inquisitor's papers. Will there be a bombardment? I have to decide before 22:00.
6192355000776067 
6192355000776068 
6192355000776069 If I bring the papers to the Headquarters, there will be a bombardment. The Polyhedron will be demolished. Rivers of blood will spill—enough to make the panacea for everyone.
6192355000776070 
6192355000776071 
6192355000776072 If I burn the papers, or at least hide them till 22:00, the soldiers will leave without firing. The living won't die. Earth's wonders will survive.
6192355000776073 
6192355000776074 
6192355000776075 The choice has been made.
6192355000776076 The udurgh is the Living Earth. I choose her. Ancient aurochs return from the depths of time.
6192355000776077 The udurgh is living people. I choose them. The sand pest will be eradicated forever.
6192355000776078 
6192355000776079 
6192355000776080 The Polyhedron is about to be shot down.
6192355000776081 
6192355000776082 
6192355000776083 The Polyhedron is no more. Blood seeps from the ground. All that's left is taking as much as I can.
6192355000776084 Listen! What have you <i>done?</i> How could this happen? You lied to me, didn't you? And not just me, to all of us!
6192355000776085 What did I do that's so wrong?
6192355000776086 Coda
6192355000776087 
6192355000776088 
6192355000776089 The rest is silence.
6192355000776090 The Town is mine to explore. Always has been. I'll touch it one last time and then return to where it all began.
6192355000776967 What do you want?
6192355000776968 Keep standing guard, I've got nothing.
6192355000776969 Don't fret, I've got a paper from Saburov.
6192355000776970 Got your hands on a permit, huh? Go on in then, it's your funeral.
6192355000776971 Don't worry, I've seen worse.
6192355000776972 I'm not scared of a little dirt.
6192355000782251 Is this your money, sir? I think you dropped your purse.
6192355000782252 I've no use for money. Not like it buys anything here.
6192355000782253 …Of course it is. Thank you so much for giving it back.
6192355000782254 Is this some kind of test of character?
6192355000782255 Alas, today is not the day for commerce. Suspicious folk from out of town are outlawed. But there's a shop that deals in stolen loot, stood among the Warehouses, trading with all sorts and no regard for reputation.\nSo you may find a use for money yet.
6192355000782256 You think so?
6192355000782257 Should you restore your reputation, sir, would you then wish to seek its ruin anew with theft and robbery? No! Of course you wouldn't.\nBut trust in trade; for coins cannot recall from whence they came.
6192355000782258 Indeed, they are a man's best friend…
6192355000782259 Save money, sir. You'll need it yet.
6192355000782260 An optimist, I see.
6192355000782261 You sure about that?
6192355000782262 Ah, just the kind of place I'm looking for.
6192355000782263 I prefer to barter for what I need.
6192355000782264 Thanks, man in black.
6192355000782265 I don't know what to do with it, given the circumstances.
6192355000782268 Human.
6192355000782269 Rat.
6192355000782270 Is that a mask you're wearing?
6192355000782271 ...What are you?
6192355000782272 No.
6192355000782273 What are you then?
6192355000782274 Someone, pinch me.
6192355000782275 A thing of the dark. A thing of the depth. Flesh of earth's warm flesh. I know answers. You don't even ask questions. What are you looking for here, in the depths?
6192355000782276 Happiness, I guess... Same as everyone.
6192355000782277 Truth.
6192355000782278 We're not that deep.
6192355000782279 You won't die of sand pest. It's not a threat to you, and thus not your main concern.
6192355000782280 No threat?
6192355000782281 Wrong. Time buries you, deeper and deeper with each minute. You're deep enough in my soil that I can give you advice now.
6192355000782282 Since when is soil yours? It's mine.
6192355000782283 Like how to get out of this cesspool, I hope?
6192355000782284 What is, then?
6192355000782285 It came after the people who want too much and do too little. You have it the other way round.
6192355000782286 Really?
6192355000782287 Flattering.
6192355000782288 Sand pest will kill everyone for real, but not you. But there is someone in the town who can truly destroy you. Ignorance is a worse threat to you than a strange disease.
6192355000782289 What <i>will</i> kill me then?
6192355000782290 I won't tell. You'll figure it out. Else it makes no sense. And you wouldn't believe me anyway.
6192355000782291 I don't believe you as it is.
6192355000782292 I'm not that special.
6192355000782293 That's what I thought... old bullshit. "Everything happens for a reason", "you'll figure it out when the time comes"... bleh.
6192355000782294 Farewell, thing. You gave me food for thought.
6192355000782295 Why are you in a rush? Whom did you expect to find here, in the Town Hall? The Committee for the Prevention of the Outbreak? The rulers?\nNow I, the Sand Plague, also known as the Sand Pest, flesh of the earth's flesh, will rule this town.
6192355000782296 There was an alarm bell.
6192355000782297 As a truly progressive leader, I shall instill a new order among you. Heed this. The laws will be few, for you don't have much longer to live.
6192355000782298 I'm all ears.
6192355000782299 Yeah, I was expecting to find people. So I'm the first to get here? Good.
6192355000782300 Thresholds are not to be crossed. They who cross one are doomed. Wherever I catch you, stay put. Don't move. \nIf I got you inside, you stay there. If I got you outside, stay there. Thresholds are not for you now.
6192355000782301 Next.
6192355000782302 No, you heed this: I'm a doctor, you're a disease. The laws shall be mine.
6192355000782303 I guess I'm hallucinating from exhaustion... I need to get some sleep.
6192355000782304 You are not to deliberate, doubt, and toss about. You are not to think. They who abandon their attachments, feelings, and individual thought, who drop their self and name, who turn into worthless grass, will be allowed to live slightly longer.
6192355000782305 I'm writing this down.
6192355000782306 I forbid you to kill children. Let them be the most resilient of us all.
6192355000782307 Enough. I'm leaving.
6192355000782308 I forbid you to touch the Kin. Leave my people alone. It's dwindling as it is.
6192355000782309 Bite your tongue. Enough of this.
6192355000782310 You are all to have same faces, same thoughts, and same actions. A swarm, a hive, a flock. No more changing faces or names. Only I get to do this now. \nYou may trade clothes, food, things, and promises, if you like. But your selves are forfeit now. <i>I</i> will change you.
6192355000782311 These are hints on how to destroy you, aren't they?
6192355000782312 You're not entirely honest, pest. I'm good at detecting lies. But I will find a way to get under your skin and learn the truth.
6192355000782313 Do not cast shadows. Do not fulfill promises. Do not create new items. Do not connect the unconnectable.\nI hereby grant each doctor nine days to give up and leave this place for good.
6192355000782314 Nine days are more than enough.
6192355000782315 I give you <i>three</i> days to scram. Then I'll defeat you.
6192355000782316 Wait! Saying is doing, right? Let's stop talking then.
6192355000782319 Anyone I touch will die. No one can survive on their own. No one can help. Seal your eyes with dirt and return to the soil from whence you came, and crawl there. Only the silent and the patient will survive me.
6192355000782320 You have no power over me.
6192355000782321 I accept your laws. But you'll regret this.
6192355000782322 Fair enough. See you around.
6192355000783951 One can buy things in this shop no matter their reputation.

6192355000784652 Has a courier been here? Carrying papers?

6192355000810352 Oyun summons you.\nHe said: "If tangher Burakh doesn't come, tell him I'm not long for this world. If I die, so will the answers he seeks."\nDid my words reach you?
6192355000810353 Yes.
6192355000811654 
6192355000813053 Want to ask?
6192355000813054 Where did you come from?
6192355000813056 I have the proof I need to demolish that tower of death. This is a goodbye, then, Artemy Burakh. \nOver these last few days, you have truly become… significant, to me. Perhaps the one person I care about.
6192355000813058 The children seem to think it's a tower of life.
6192355000813059 Children also throw bullets into fires and believe in the tooth fairy.
6192355000813060 You seem to hold a personal grudge against that building.
6192355000813063 Yes. Demolishing it is my life's work.\nI can say it safely, now. Because I am not long for this world.
6192355000813064 Why are you so desperate?
6192355000813066 Today I will be killed.
6192355000813067 By whom?
6192355000813068 How do you know?
6192355000813069 Call it a hunch.
6192355000813070 What for?
6192355000813071 The military would never miss a shot at an inquisitor. We always hinder their advances. They pay us back in kind.\nI know they have the order. They must. This isn't my first year on the job.
6192355000813072 You need to flee, then.
6192355000813073 I have thought about it. Send a courier in my place… or better yet, three. But no. That would be cowardice.
6192355000813074 Do send them! Three should be enough.
6192355000813075 Give me the papers. I'll take them to the Town Hall.
6192355000813076 And you'll get arrested immediately. Can you afford that?
6192355000813077 No.
6192355000813080 You've made your choice, then.\nYou are right. Fleeing would be a coward's choice. You cannot afford it, so neither can I.
6192355000813081 So be it, then.
6192355000813082 You know what? To hell with it. Let's run off together.
6192355000813088 Good… Yes. It's the right thing to do. Right.\nA train will wait for us by the Passenger Station at two in the morning. I will meet you there.
6192355000813089 See you.
6192355000813090 Right.
6192355000813091 So are you.
6192355000813092 No. You're a full-fledged human being.\nWe are taught that humans are processes. Nearly half will halt this process at a very early stage. Another half will even regress after growing up, shedding what little progress they made in childhood.
6192355000813093 It's hard to grow.
6192355000813094 I'm a brute, and not a clever one at that.
6192355000813095 You can trust me on this, Burakh.\nI'd say you'd make a fine inquisitor, but… no. You wouldn't, actually. Your tools are different. You don't use our mode of analysis, but you still see the big picture. Connecting the dots is the foundation of our work.
6192355000813096 Very well. I'll take your word for it.
6192355000813097 Tell me about your work.
6192355000813098 It is a story too long to be told short.\nYou build out a map of facts, and conclusions, then snap a picture of them. Keeping in mind that facts, too, are processes; they change over time. Then you tease out connections from one to the other…
6192355000813099 Yes. The Lines.
6192355000813100 Sounds… familiar.
6192355000813101 Perhaps a great bull, Bos Turokh, came to bid us farewell. They do that. I had a dream where one derailed my train… An eternity ago, now.
6192355000813102 Tell me what's waiting for me there.
6192355000813103 Yes. That, too.
6192355000813104 I don't care about the Kin. I just want to make a sort of medicine, Kindred. A serum, a panacea…
6192355000813105 Is this some kind of trial?
6192355000813106 What does that word mean to you?
6192355000813107 An empty, ancient, mindless rite.
6192355000813108 It doesn't matter what you want. What matters is what you're made for.\nThe Abattoir is where you'll see if this is your destiny. If you're ready for it. If you want to take care of what remains of the Kin, or not.
6192355000813109 I've made up my mind already.
6192355000813110 That's not enough.
6192355000813111 But I don't want to go.
6192355000813113 A way to test your fate.
6192355000813114 What does it mean to <i>you?</i>
6192355000813115 There, inside, you'll understand why your father did the deed for which he was killed. I think you will.
6192355000813116 What deed?
6192355000813117 All right. I'm going.
6192355000813118 Do you know who killed him?
6192355000813119 He tore apart old connections.
6192355000813120 Connections between what?
6192355000813121 All answers lie in Olonngo, Kindred. If you return alive but still confused, I'll try to explain it… if I'm not dead by then.
6192355000813122 Is the Abattoir open for me now?
6192355000813123 The Gates of Labor, through which workers pass, are locked. So are the Gates of Sorrow, from which carcasses leave. For now. \nThe Bulljaw, through which bulls pass, is open now. It will accept you.
6192355000813124 Are they expecting new bulls from the steppe?
6192355000813125 One.
6192355000813126 Fine. I'll go inside.
6192355000813127 All right.
6192355000813128 He must have had his reasons. He knew the Lines.
6192355000813129 I'll make new ones.
6192355000813130 My advice: Olonngo means "Ford." We come inside light and gutted.\nBetter not to take anything with you. What you cling to will fall from your hands there.\nDon't be scared of that. If you mount the Ford, they will return. And you will understand.
6192355000813131 Fine.
6192355000813132 I'm heavy. That's not a burden I can drop.
6192355000813133 I think I'll keep my clothes, at least.
6192355000813134 By my eyes?
6192355000813135 What, do I look older now?
6192355000813136 What did you see there?
6192355000813137 The guts of our people.
6192355000813138 I refuse to rule the Kin. I don't want anything to do with them.
6192355000813139 I saw… strange things.
6192355000813140 Yes, Khatangher. We are beasts. We crave a strong hand.\nYou understand now that you must take power over them. Take an udhey and herd them like cattle.
6192355000813141 That's not what Father used to say.
6192355000813142 Your father's path brought us no happiness. They don't need to be turned into people. Animals demand a different sort of care.\nDon't you see, akhar? This cursed plague is no threat to us while we remain beasts. Mother Boddho's blessings fall on simplicity. Earth doesn't brook those who walk too straight.
6192355000813143 Father did everything right.
6192355000813144 What does that have to do with the infection? It's not like we're immortal. We'll still die like cattle—just a bit later, perhaps.
6192355000813145 Your father let the sand plague into the town. He let everything you now see around you happen—deliberately.
6192355000813146 You're lying. Father stopped it five years ago. As he would now, if he hadn't died.
6192355000813147 I don't believe you.
6192355000813148 …I knew it.
6192355000813149 Five years ago, he failed to understand the sand pest's nature. He had no time to think. He was a man of action—just like you, akhar.\nFor years, he contemplated the outbreak. I think those thoughts drove him mad. When it returned, he opened the door. Eagerly.
6192355000813150 Why would he do that?
6192355000814051 I'm too simple to understand his complex reasons. He believed the sand pest would turn subhumans into humans. Creatures-who-have-not-lived into living creatures.\nHe said: "A town like ours must endure it to live and mature. It's called a vaccination."
6192355000814052 What else did he say?
6192355000814053 That you would come and finish what he started.
6192355000814054 No. I don't believe it. You must be confused. You couldn't understand his designs.
6192355000814055 Wait… I need some time to think it all over.
6192355000814056 You're not simple, Kindred. You're stupid.
6192355000814057 Whether you die or kill, you touch death. What matters is what you understand in that crucial moment.\nIf you understand too little, you won't survive this fleeting touch. Whether you die or kill, you still won't.\nThat's what the elders say.
6192355000814058 What else do they say?
6192355000814059 I have no attachment to this life. I wanted you to understand. If you rushed and killed me too early, you would regret it later.
6192355000814060 I don't think so.
6192355000814061 Speak.
6192355000814062 That everyone should do what they must.
6192355000814063 And settle debts.
6192355000814064 I don't value my life, Kindred. I want to die. My guilt is heavy, and conscience eats me from the inside like sand pest. Mother Boddho's warm flesh will soothe me. Do what you must. Lay me down.
6192355000814065 No. I forbid you to die. Live with what you've done. That's a punishment worse than death.
6192355000814066 Tell me everything.
6192355000814067 I honored your father. We weren't friends, but we had mutual respect. He understood me. Unlike others, he didn't despise me. He knew why I serve the Olgimskys.\nYour father was wise. But then he lost his mind, and invited death into the Town.
6192355000814068 Go on.
6192355000814069 He went to the steppe with Simon Kain that night. The one who built the Town upwards. Across the river. They were friends with him.\nThey dug Earth in the steppe. One of the Khatanghe saw. I learned of that and hurried to them.
6192355000814070 Why?
6192355000814071 I wanted to understand. Why dig, unless you have a corpse to bury?
6192355000814072 Go on.
6192355000814076 And then what?
6192355000814077 I found him at home. I found him sick.\nHe confessed that he was sick with sand pest. That it can't be stopped, <i>shouldn't</i> be stopped. That the Town needs it.\nHe spoke like a madman. I saw then that the disease drove him mad. I put him out of his misery.
6192355000814078 Put him out of his misery?
6192355000814079 The misery of both madness and sand plague.\nI wasn't in the Crude Sprawl five years ago. I only heard their screams—and my blood chilled, even though I don't frighten easy. The sand plague is torture, with no salvation.
6192355000814080 Father could decide that for himself.
6192355000814081 He spoke like a madman. He couldn't decide anything for himself.
6192355000814082 It wasn't your place, you mindless beast, to judge whether he was mad or too wise for you to understand!
6192355000814083 I forgive you, Oyun. Father would.
6192355000814084 Do it yourself. You have until tomorrow morning.
6192355000814085 Let it be so. Prepare to die.
6192355000814086 Who killed my father, Kindred?
6192355000814087 One of our own.
6192355000814088 Who, exactly?
6192355000814089 What for?
6192355000814090 I'll tell you when I'm sure our people have a future.
6192355000814091 You're playing with fire, Khatangher.
6192355000814092 No one from the Kin would dare lay a hand on him.
6192355000814093 Is he still staying in my father's house?
6192355000814094 He lost a lot of blood, emshen. You should sew him. You know how.
6192355000814096 Fine.
6192355000814097 He's strong. He won't be gone before he's due.
6192355000814098 Who's that with you?
6192355000814099 A state inquisitor.
6192355000814100 Why?
6192355000814101 My wife.
6192355000814102 Destination?
6192355000814103 Away from here.
6192355000814106 None of your business.
6192355000814107 Just seeing the sights.
6192355000814108 We have an order from General Block.
6192355000814109 Hey, over there! What are you waiting for? Seize her!
6192355000814110 Perhaps we can strike a bargain, lieutenant?
6192355000814111 Fine, fine. You've won. We're turning back.
6192355000814112 The inquisitor has finished her job here. She's returning to the Capital. I'm her escort.
6192355000814113 Step aside. We'll talk to you later.
6192355000814114 No, we'll talk now.
6192355000814115 I'm a doctor. Is anyone here sick?
6192355000814116 All right. I'll wait.
6192355000814118 I'm a doctor. Sanitary inspection. Any infected among you?
6192355000814119 Quarantine breach. And there was a special order regarding the inquisitor.\nAs I said, you're free to go. The Town is to the north. I won't repeat myself a third time.
6192355000814120 …
6192355000814121 Think you're above the fear of death…?
6192355000814122 You won't live to see tomorrow.
6192355000814123 It's not your blood.
6192355000814124 This blood belongs to everyone.
6192355000814125 Why would an emshen need shoohan, living blөөd? You do not knөөw what to do with it.\nOur blөөd is shared. You are not part of us. You are different. Your blөөd is different.
6192355000814126 I feel like I'm dying without it.
6192355000814127 If I have a gulp, maybe I <i>will</i> become part of you.
6192355000814128 I <i>am</i> like you.
6192355000814129 Tsoe she daa? Who are үүou?
6192355000814130 A yargachin.
6192355000814131 An emshen.
6192355000814132 Mes zasliin emch.
6192355000814133 I know. It's an old legend.
6192355000814139 Are they immune to the plague?
6192355000814140 Unente. This is so.\nDo you know why we dance barefoot?
6192355000814141 Tell me.
6192355000814142 I do. I grew up here.
6192355000814143 We can also open things up—but not like you, butchers. We dance with Earth. We touch her with our feet, we caress it, yargachin.\nWe pry her open. To make herbs grow. To make air heady with its odor. To have food for our cattle.
6192355000814144 This air reeks of death.
6192355000814145 Yes, that's why they call you Herb Brides.
6192355000814146 We know how to open things up. Our way. You know how to open things up. Your way. Do you want to know why the sand pest passes us by? Show yourself.\nCut a living sister in such a way that she stays living. You can do it, if you know the Lines.
6192355000814147 You're crazy!
6192355000814148 And your clothes split open as you dance, too. Which is why you're dressed like that.
6192355000814149 If you need to pry something open, you don't need to cut it. The best tear is the one that appears on its own. This is the way of love.\nYou butchers are less gentle. You are allowed to cut with knives.
6192355000814150 True.
6192355000814151 I think I've done all I could for today. Now all that remains is to wait until the coast is clear.
6192355000814152 I think I've done all I can for today. Now all that remains is to wait until the coast is clear.
6192355000814951 I'm done with everything important for today. I'm free to rest until tomorrow… or explore the Town. At night, its face changes.
6192355000814952 I am glad you came.
6192355000814953 I am glad you waited.
6192355000814954 So you're no longer inquisitor…
6192355000814956 All right. Go into the train car. I'll be right behind you.
6192355000814957 As you say.
6192355000816151 I'm no butcher. You're no cattle.
6192355000816152 All right.
6192355000816153 Do it, yargachin. Prove that they call you emshen for a reason. Do you want to know the truth? See, she's not afraid. Why do you tremble, then?
6192355000816154 Ugh. Have it your way.
6192355000816155 Wait. I need some time to collect my thoughts.
6192355000817751 
6192355000817752 
6192355000817779 Kid
6192355000817783 There's a metal crust on the side of our town. And it's growing.\nThe Warehouses are made of iron, and they grow into the earth. The Big Station is made of iron, and its railroad grows into it, too.
6192355000817784 And what does that mean?
6192355000817785 The Warehouses aren't made of iron. I think it's zinc.
6192355000817786 The Station infects the earth with iron.\nYou're a doctor—right? So tell me, is it good or bad?
6192355000817787 Well, there's nothing good about infection.
6192355000817788 Soil contains a lot of iron anyway.
6192355000817789 I don't know… What do you think?
6192355000817790 What? Who cares! Your zinc is iron too.
6192355000817791 Well… in a way.
6192355000817792 So what?
6192355000817793 Yeah, but that's inside! That's native iron. Inside-iron. Like in blood.
6192355000817794 Huh, you're a biologist.
6192355000817795 What's the difference, anyway?
6192355000817796 Your answer ain't good enough.\nThe Station is infecting the steppe with iron. Is it good or bad?
6192355000817797 It's tolerable.
6192355000817798 It's bad.
6192355000817799 It's not a thing you should judge.
6192355000817800 Nuh-uh! Actually, it's very good. I think it is. All those iron seeds will grow, and our town will grow, too.\nThere are different kinds of infection.
6192355000817801 Any kind of infection means death.
6192355000817802 The Town will grow, but the steppe will die. That's how infection works.
6192355000817803 Yeah, well… take a walk through town and check out an <i>actual</i> infection.
6192355000817804 Anyway, doctor, can you make it so that it never stops?\nYou're a doctor. You fight infection. Well, don't touch this one, all right?
6192355000817805 How would I go about curing this one, anyway?
6192355000817806 I cure illness in people's bodies… I can't cure iron in the earth.
6192355000817807 No. I detest all kinds of infection.
6192355000817808 You'll find out soon. Not today, but soon.\nIf you don't believe me, ascend the Tower—they'll let you in there this time. Perhaps you'll see something. Or maybe you won't.
6192355000817809 They'll let me into the Polyhedron? It would be a waste to miss that opportunity!
6192355000817810 I won't play your games, kids. I have a game of my own.
6192355000817811 Not today, huh? Well, in that case, I'm not even sure I'll live to see it.
6192355000817812 …Iron creeps into the steppe: the railroad. Iron creeps into the steppe: elongated things. Also: rusty wheels. Train wheels in grass.
6192355000817813 Also, old car parts. And dilapidated factories.
6192355000817814 Earth can digest anything, don't worry.
6192355000817815 Oh yeah! The Factory too! It turns bulls into canned meat—same process!\nIs it true that the Factory was a Foundry first? 'Cause they found copper in the steppe?
6192355000817816 True. But then the copper disappeared somehow. So they turned it into a slaughterhouse.
6192355000817817 Judging by our piping, it's plausible.
6192355000817818 …Me, I don't like iron. It's wicked. Alien. And rusty.
6192355000817819 "Iron—Cold Iron—shall be master of you all!" Do you know that poem?
6192355000817820 Who does…
6192355000817821 Yeah? Well, I like it. Iron is my ally. My tools are made of it.
6192355000818151 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355000818152 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355000818951 Khan
6192355000818952 Capella
6192355000818953 Can't you see we're in the middle of a conversation? You're interrupting.
6192355000818954 Why is no one ever happy to see me?
6192355000818955 A familiar tone. Maria Kaina's brother, are you?
6192355000818956 You are a doctor—a brave and useful person. So I'll be patient and won't stoop to quarrel. But do understand—Capella and I will not continue our conversation until you leave.
6192355000818957 Go on, then. Talk.
6192355000818959 It's no secret.\nIf you see her, tell her everything is fine in the Polyhedron. Let her worry about coming into Mother's role. Got it?
6192355000818960 I think so. There weren't too many long words. But maybe you could repeat it, just in case.
6192355000818962  
6192355000818963  
6192355000818964  
6192355000818965 I'm so pleased to see you. Please, meet Caspar. We call him Khan. I haven't formally introduced him to you before, have I?\nWe were just discussing our plans for after the outbreak.
6192355000818966 Planning a future together, huh?
6192355000818967 You don't look too happy.
6192355000818969 I… no, I phrased that wrong. Well, not wrong, but… never mind.\nCan I be of any help?
6192355000818970 Nah. I can see I'm a third wheel here.
6192355000818971 Yes. Finish your conversation and go home.
6192355000819251 Officer
6192355000820851 Apostate
6192355000821451 I'm not authorized to tell you.
6192355000821452 Where's General Block?
6192355000821453 So you're leaving, huh?
6192355000821454 Yes.
6192355000821455 Where's General Block?
6192355000821456 At HQ.
6192355000821457 I see.
6192355000821458 Where did you two come from? I thought all the children evacuated.
6192355000821459 Everyone who wanted to stay, did.\nLike your kids. Have you checked on them recently?
6192355000821460 More or less…
6192355000821461 They're still alive. That's what matters.
6192355000821462 The Tower was brilliant in every way, except for one. Whoever lived there could never grow up.\nIt was interesting, in a way. But it was getting stale.
6192355000821463 So you want to grow up, huh?
6192355000821464 The Tower gets in our way. It's too strong a temptation.\nI guess it would be easier for us if it just disappeared. But while it's still there, our will isn't strong enough to refuse it. So there we stay. Glued.\nYou could do something about it, y'know.
6192355000821465 No. You should train your will, instead.
6192355000821466 I won't. It's up to you. That's how you grow up, too.
6192355000821467 So you want to get rid of temptation, huh? Sure, I can help you.
6192355000821468 Three couriers have been here, but they all missed the general. So they went out into the Town to look for him.
6192355000821469 Where is he? The general?
6192355000821470 "Once again..." Your military is a circus!
6192355000821471 This will not be discussed.
6192355000821472 So where is Block?
6192355000821473 He went out to restore order. Longin's people had three outposts in the Town, so he could be at any one of them.
6192355000821474 So the couriers went after him? And they split up?
6192355000821475 I guess.\nLongin's men had three outposts. That's all I know.
6192355000821476 I'll go look for them, then.
6192355000821477 I'll wait here.
6192355000821478 Damn it! Time's running out…
6192355000821479 Be my guest. There's sure to be a fight, but I know the general will pull through. He's not the type to be killed by a stray bullet.
6192355000821480 …For now.
6192355000821481 No, I can't wait.
6192355000821482 However it goes with the rebels, our train departs today at twenty-two hundred. Those are our orders.
6192355000821483 So the bombardment is off?
6192355000821484 The Army departs at ten, then? I should hurry…
6192355000821485 Depends on who wins. I've heard that half the officers want to pay this wretched town back. But the general would rather avoid it.\nOr perhaps it's the other way around? Who knows. In any case, we're leaving at ten.
6192355000821486 Well, there <i>is</i> a structure it would make sense to flatten…
6192355000821487 Then we should avoid it.
6192355000821529 Yeah? And who'll take pity on <i>me?</i>
6192355000821532 Mother Boddho is full of living blood. She forms us from her body. We live, as long as she lives. She lives, as long as steaming blood flows through her.
6192355000821533 I see…
6192355000821538 Brides caress Earth with their feet. Worms dwell in it. The throatless emerge from soil whenever Earth wants people to hear her.
6192355000821539 …And Sand Pest.
6192355000821540 You went the wrong way, emshen. You stumble through the wrong path. Be khara, you know not what you look for.\nThe sand pest is the scream of Mother Boddho. We are her murmur. Now, she murmurs lovingly to you, like an infant.
6192355000821541 But which of us is the child and which is the parent?
6192355000821542 We run out of words, essegher. Out of sounds. Hard to speak. Throatless, tongueless! Wordless.\nPlease take pity on our mother yours-and-mine, essegher. Kill us not. Boleesh, boleesh, byy alysh…
6192355000821543 I'll have to kill <i>someone.</i>
6192355000821544 I understand.
6192355000821545 Yes… I do pity you. More humans will be born, but your kind is irreplaceable.
6192355000821546 What are you getting at?
6192355000821547 No. I don't want to inhabit an earth that would do <i>this</i> to humans.
6192355000821548 Don't humans do worse by her? Why do they pierce her? Why do they build unbearable towns upon her body? She is so terribly burdened. Her ribs crack under this town's weight. It may be small, but it is heavier than many.
6192355000821549 It's tough for everyone.
6192355000822478 Show us if you are a good menkhu, emshen. Show us you know how to connect things.
6192355000822479 What things?
6192355000822480 Sure, just give me a rope.
6192355000822481 The emshen is modest. It takes no wisdom to see that a cord connects mother to child, yes. It takes no wisdom to see that a stone falling into a river connects to the ripples on the surface. \nBut to see the connection between the stone and the mother? It does nenpa gu dzom, emshen.
6192355000822482 What do I need to connect? And where?
6192355000822483 All you need to do is place them close to one another.
6192355000822484 It's people who connect things. Touch one, then another—and a connection forms.
6192355000822485 Touch them how?
6192355000822486 With a glance. Just the way you like it.
6192355000822487 With a thought, obviously. Real connections are formed in the mind.
6192355000822488 With a hand, of course.
6192355000822489 Here, on these rocks. You know how it works. A table to cut and mix.
6192355000822490 But I need… I need herbs, roots. Where can I get them?
6192355000822491 But I've got nothing on me.
6192355000822492 Take what you find around. Should we wait for you?
6192355000822493 No. I know what to do.
6192355000822494 Yes.
6192355000822495 I'll have to work on this stone slab?
6192355000822496 Yes.
6192355000822497 I can't brew much on it.
6192355000822500 
6192355000822501 
6192355000822502 
6192355000822503 
6192355000822504 
6192355000822505 
6192355000822506 
6192355000822507 
6192355000822508 
6192355000822509 
6192355000822512 
6192355000822513 
6192355000822514 
6192355000822515 
6192355000822516 
6192355000822518 
6192355000822519 
6192355000822520 
6192355000822521 
6192355000822522 
6192355000822523 
6192355000822524 
6192355000822525 
6192355000822526 
6192355000822527 Speak to me.
6192355000822528 Who are you?
6192355000822529 I am a zurkhen. I am your heart, Khatangher. \nYou have connected things, so you can now hold me in your hand. Hear my voice as if I were a stranger.\nSpeak to me.
6192355000822530 What's going on here?
6192355000822531 You now see the nature of the Kin.\nLook: The sand pest shirks the quiet and the humble. The ones who do not know the thought of <i>self.</i> Who do not reach upward…
6192355000822532 …But walk on all fours instead. I see.
6192355000822533 This is a lie. Or are you saying the thousands that died in the Termitary were not of the Kin?
6192355000822534 They lived in a stone sack. Torn away from Earth, stuck into a town, to work in a factory and become like people.\nWho severs themselves from people and from land, dies.
6192355000822535 It wasn't their fault.
6192355000822536 Not about blame. Earth cares not if you have guilt.\nThe ones who keep roots underground; who walk barefoot; who sleep in Earth's hold, fear no pain. The ones who forget how badly Earth can hurt die broken by that pain.
6192355000822537 By Earth's pain—do you mean the sand pest?
6192355000822538 That which you call the sand pest is just an aspect of Earth. Her agony, her scream, her voice.\nIt's only lethal to humans, but not to those who forget the word <i>I.</i> Not to those who speak little. Those who have no need of words don't feel it at all.
6192355000822539 So the sand pest is only lethal to humans?
6192355000822546 What matters is <i>someone</i> still believes. Your people believed all these centuries. Else why feed her blood so many years?\nA pity she's dying. Few of your people remain. With them, their knowledge dies, too. And their silent language, that they used to convey and understand complex ideas.
6192355000822547 My people… are too frightening.
6192355000822548 This disease threatens only those who sever themselves from Earth. Stay with us and live.\nMerge with us. Return to us. We love you. Don't split off. You hurt without us just as much as I hurt, torn out of you… Return to your body, tangher… and your body is your people.
6192355000822549 I'm not an animal. I'm human.
6192355000822550 I want to live.
6192355000822851 A human's path leads always to death. Can't you see?\nAre you even human? Why did you return here to us, then? There's no way back from here.
6192355000822852 There is. The human way is to touch death. You said so yourself, heart.
6192355000822853 Stay here, with Mother Boddho, Earth, and live. Split off from her, become human, and die. A lovely choice…
6192355000822854 I can see the way. Tell me, heart, what is this pit?
6192355000822855 Great bulls were slaughtered here. Their blood trickled down into that pit, dissolving in Earth. Feeding her. Granting her life. Do you want to know if you're beast or human? Step into the abyss. Follow the bulls.
6192355000822856 On my own…?
6192355000822857 Like hell I will.
6192355000822858 Fine. I want to live. I'll stay.
6192355000822951 An aspect of the earth… I don't believe in its personification.
6192355000822953 Be simpler. Be silent. Abandon speech. You'll feel what they want you to know without it. When you need to express yourself, you'll find a way to connect to them without words, too.\nThere will be no other people. Everything will be united in Earth.
6192355000822954 Fine. I'll stay. I'll abandon speech.
6192355000822955 I won't be one of you. I'm human, not a bull.
6192355000823251 
6192355000823351 It can't be cut from the Earth. Means you can't cut it from us.
6192355000823352 So if I cure this disease… I'll hurt you?
6192355000823353 You know the answer.
6192355000823354 I don't believe it. It can't just all go away. You can't simply dissolve…
6192355000823355 The umbilical cord will stay. But what will flow through it?
6192355000823356 That's fine. You're not children anymore.
6192355000823357 Suits you fine.
6192355000823358 Don't you care for this loss? We are the last of our kind.
6192355000823359 …I do. You are unique.
6192355000823360 Some come, others go. Life doesn't stop just because one piece ceased to exist.
6192355000823361 No name.
6192355000823362 What are you made of?
6192355000823363 Of clay and bones.
6192355000823364 Are you the shabnak-adyg?
6192355000823365 Listen to the words. Mother Boddho wants to speak to you.
6192355000823366 Speak.
6192355000823367 Did Earth herself make you?
6192355000823368 To speak. To tell you.
6192355000823369 Then speak.
6192355000823370 You've chosen a strange place to meet.
6192355000823371 All is connected. All is whole. Flesh and Earth are the same.\nWe are made of Earth. Earth is soaked with blood. As we feed her, we create a khachirkhel.
6192355000823372 I figured that out already.
6192355000823373 The Brides stomped her. The Worms kneaded her. They helped Earth.
6192355000823374 The Brides?
6192355000823375 The Worms? You mean the odonghs?
6192355000823378 They awaken Earth. Caress it with touch. Herbs sprout. We appear.
6192355000823379 I see.
6192355000823380 All loops. The circle is complete. One turns into the other. All moves.\nEarth lives and creates strange things.
6192355000823381 Enough. I understand already.
6192355000823382 Don't talk. I understand without words.
6192355000823383 I'll give you a name.
6192355000823384 Name.
6192355000823385 I'll call you Artemy.
6192355000823386 I'll call you Isidor.
6192355000823387 I'll call you Hюmhan. A creature made of fingernails.
6192355000823388 Yes, yes.
6192355000823389 You are a creature of clay and bones.
6192355000823390 I'll call you Khooloy. I'll give you a throat.
6192355000823391 What do you want?
6192355000823392 <i>Khachirkhel</i> is "strange things," right? "Impossible things"?
6192355000823393 What do I need to learn?
6192355000823396 Khamgyin khachirkhaltay zүyl yuu veh?
6192355000823397 "The strangest thing in the world," huh… I guess it's you.
6192355000823398 Aurochs, the ancient bulls. "Buha-noyon," as they were called.
6192355000823399 Herb Brides. The ones who dance with Earth.
6192355000823400 The odonghs. Half-human, half-worm.
6192355000823401 The sand pest. I've never seen anything stranger.
6192355000823402 Earth. I have no other answer.
6192355000823403 Do you want me to give you a voice?
6192355000823404 Give me a voice.
6192355000823405 I name you Ushkhaan.
6192355000823406 The circulation of life's juices.
6192355000823407 I name you emshen. You can do much. You know how bodies are composed.
6192355000823408 Not all of them.
6192355000823409 How did Earth make you?
6192355000823410 They're worms in the soil. They make it softer. Kinder.
6192355000823411 So that's why they exist…
6192355000823412 I thought people called them Worms to humiliate them.
6192355000823413 It's not a disease. It's pain. Earth's anguish.\nWhat you call the sand plague is an aspect of Earth. An agony. A scream. Its voice. Its <i>medrel.</i>
6192355000823414 "Medrel." You mean the nerves?
6192355000823415 Emshen.
6192355000823416 You don't need to croak. I'll give you a throat. I name you Amahn.
6192355000823417 You are a wise doctor, maes zaslыm emch. Will you care for me?
6192355000823418 You're not sick.
6192355000823419 I'm a doctor. It's my job to destroy it. For the people.
6192355000823420 People have destroyed everything that makes Earth alive. They turned Olonngo into an Abattoir. They added a Termitary. They herded the people inside, robbed them of life.\nThey killed our last great bull.
6192355000823421 So how do I handle the disease? If you're all one and the same…
6192355000823422 I want to wake up.
6192355000823423 Mother Boddho speaks through me.\nListen, for she asks: Will you spare me? Will you let me live?
6192355000823424 I am a doctor. The only thing I fight is the disease. The sand plague.
6192355000823425 I couldn't hurt you even if I wanted to.
6192355000823426 Yes. I promise.
6192355000823427 What's wrong with you?
6192355000823428 If you do your job, I will die.
6192355000823429 My job is to cure the sand pest.
6192355000823430 I'm sorry.
6192355000823431 I don't want you to go. You make the world a more beautiful place.
6192355000828351 Hello, Father.
6192355000829951 So you're alive…?
6192355000829952 You seem angry with me.
6192355000829953 I'm not.
6192355000829954 Yes. See, I've done it. I'm just as surprised as you are.
6192355000829955 You've done what?
6192355000829956 I transcended death.
6192355000829957 How?
6192355000829958 I don't know.\nDeath is a mire, engulfing those who cross. But some escape.
6192355000829959 …What do I do now?
6192355000829960 I am.
6192355000829961 <i>You</i> seem angry with me.
6192355000829962 All I ever wanted was for you to understand what happened here. How it all went. Why it was needed.
6192355000829963 Is it true that you were the one who unleashed the plague?
6192355000829964 How?
6192355000829965 I've been told you're the reason for this outbreak.
6192355000829966 Too strong a word.
6192355000829967 You didn't stop it. You could have, like the first. But you didn't.
6192355000829968 Five years ago, I made a mistake. We never should have tried to hide from this disease. The Town needed to survive it. Or not.
6192355000829969 This is cruel.
6192355000829970 You let this plague happen.
6192355000829971 You were patient zero. You brought the plague to this town.
6192355000829972 Yes.
6192355000829973 But why?
6192355000829974 If you survive a disease, you develop immunity.\nOur town was grown in a greenhouse. It is a homunculus. Not particularly well adjusted to live on its own.\nWe couldn't support it forever. Simon and I were growing old. The Mistresses died. How would it fare without us?
6192355000829975 I don't understand.
6192355000829976 This town was… connected <i>wrong.</i> Its parts were tied with artificial seams—so different, so awkward. One could say that Simon, the Mistresses, and I held it all together by force.\nSo I tore it apart, so you can sew it all back, better than before. Because you're better, and smarter, than I am.
6192355000829977 You think my line of fate is more precise than yours?
6192355000829978 Why did you summon me?
6192355000829979 All I wanted was for you to understand, not follow any particular fate.
6192355000829980 So you did it for me…?
6192355000829981 Of course not. I did it for the Town. It needed a vaccination. Besides, it wasn't up to me.
6192355000829982 What are you trying to say?
6192355000829983 I stopped trying to ladle out the sea and walked straight into it. I made everyone walk with me, too. Teaching them to swim, so they'll no longer hide behind sand castle walls.
6192355000829984 You're saying horrible things. For the Town, huh? What about all the victims? Were they not part of the Town?
6192355000829985 The Town needs to move forward, but it doesn't insist. Facing the future is the way of love. Facing the past is the way of love.\nBut the two are incompatible, and it broke my heart.
6192355000829986 I choose the past, even with the plague and sand castles. I can't bear to lose all its uniqueness.
6192355000829987 You're right. The future is better than the past. Tell me more about it.
6192355000829988 You need not choose. Not yet.\nMoreover, you've already made your choice. Your actions did. For they were driven by love, whether you wanted that or not.\nLove came from understanding. Understanding creates connections. Connections are the Lines. The Lines are love.
6192355000829989 What should I do now, Father?
6192355000829990 My list… Those children will build the new Town. A better one.\nJust like the three families and their Mistresses built it before. Just like Simon and I built it, reaching to the stars.\nWe started it too quickly. We paid for our hastiness.
6192355000829991 What should I do now, Father?
6192355000829992 Do what you must. Do what you think is right. If you still have time, try to understand the world as best you can.\nYou won't make a mistake. I respect your choice—any choice. Like I said, you're better than me. You will connect us all into a new whole.
6192355000829993 I hope so.
6192355000829994 You'd do it better.
6192355000829995 I did not expect you to claw your way out of an earthen womb. So, were you disgorged by Earth too?\nMuch like me… We will understand each other better now, kholboön.
6192355000829996 Why are you here, Sahba?
6192355000829997 I've found the Eighth, Sahba. A heart beats down there.
6192355000829998 I ready the soil for sowing.
6192355000829999 What do you mean?
6192355000830000 It is time for the Kin to devour the Town. Earth is triumphant. The Town dies.\nWhen, if not now? Unente, nature demands what she is owed.
6192355000830001 So you <i>do</i> want the Kin to rebel and start a massacre?
6192355000830002 "Earth is triumphant"? What do you mean?
6192355000830003 Of course. It is good that it still beats. That blood still flows through its veins. So who is the Eighth?
6192355000830004 The Town.
6192355000830005 They wanted to start it today. But so many people died in the Warren… and now soldiers prowl the Town.\nThere will be no riot. But that changes nothing.
6192355000830006 Why?
6192355000830007 Good.
6192355000830008 So you see the sand pest as a force of nature?
6192355000830009 What will you do now, kholboön?
6192355000830010 Uphold Father's duty. I accepted it in your presence, remember?
6192355000830011 The Earth.
6192355000830012 Yes.
6192355000830013 I guess…
6192355000830014 No.
6192355000830015 Not all natural things must be endured.
6192355000830016 The Eighth is the Town. That's what Father called an udurgh. I know that now.
6192355000830017 I am a man of the Kin. Mother Boddho is my mother, too. She may be the udurgh.
6192355000831851 …Yeah.
6192355000831852 What are you doing here?
6192355000831853 Thinking.
6192355000831854 That's unlike you.
6192355000831855 We had a talk. I thought it'd be an interrogation. But no, we just… talked. For two hours.
6192355000831856 What'd you talk about?
6192355000831857 Something's… off about you.
6192355000831858 We're all toys, Cub. Just toys. Puppets.\nYou go about livin' an' breathin', all that, not a thought spared for your place in it all. But actually, you're pulled around by great strings. You think you're alive, but you ain't, pal. You ain't.\nWe have no right to call ourselves people.
6192355000831859 Wow. When'd you become such a philosopher?
6192355000831860 Nothing to do with philosophy. We are filled with cotton.
6192355000831861 Are we, now?
6192355000831862 She's an inquisitor, Grief. To her, everyone's on a hook or string.
6192355000831863 I don't want to live like that anymore. Perhaps I don't want to live at all. So, I'm thinking it over.
6192355000831864 …She broke you to pieces.
6192355000831865 You aren't. You're filled with clockwork.
6192355000831866 She knows what she's sayin'. She's a professional. She really is…\nI haven't figured it all out, not yet. But I've seen the light, Cub. I don't want to live like this.
6192355000831867 People who <i>see the light</i> gain the will to live. I suspect it wasn't that.
6192355000831868 By the way. If you could, could you drop by my warehouse? Just check on the guys. Tell 'em to lock the place up and scatter.\nTell 'em I said so. Tell 'em: "A long beak pecks millet." They'll listen.\nThey'll listen to you, anyway. They know you.
6192355000831869 Perhaps you should do it yourself?
6192355000831870 I can't do anything. Not from here. We've run all out of old Grief.
6192355000831871 All right… I'll pay them a visit. For the sake of an old friend.
6192355000831873 I won't do it. Deal with your people yourself.
6192355000831874 Were you arrested?
6192355000831875 Something like that, Cub. Not seized, so much, but bound.
6192355000831876 I'll tell her you're not as scary as you try to seem.
6192355000831877 What does she want with you?
6192355000831878 She was faster with me.
6192355000831881 Keep thinking, pal. Perhaps you'll clear your head a bit.
6192355000831882 You mean, like a storekeeper?
6192355000831883 Where would they go? Hunting in the night?
6192355000831884 That's up to them. I'm not their leader anymore. Tell 'em that.
6192355000831885 <i>You</i> tell them that.
6192355000831886 I don't like your tone.
6192355000831887 If you want to think of yourself as a puppet, go ahead. That's not how I perceive myself.
6192355000831888 Yes?
6192355000831889 What have you done to him?
6192355000831890 Me? I didn't do anything.
6192355000831891 He's all messed up!
6192355000831892 I have a unique approach to each person. Can't you see the man is thinking? Changing? Leave him be.
6192355000831893 What was he babbling about puppets? Did you tell him about that?
6192355000831894 Does he bother you?
6192355000831895 No.
6192355000831896 Did you interrogate him?
6192355000831897 No. He figured that out on his own.
6192355000831898 …Is that true?
6192355000831899 It's true for him. I don't know about <i>you.</i>
6192355000831900 Why is that?
6192355000831901 You are unlike anyone I have ever seen. Freer than other men. As though your strings are pulled by some manner of god.
6192355000831902 I don't believe in gods.
6192355000831903 Am I different, somehow?
6192355000831908 I think you… damaged him, somehow.
6192355000831909 Let him go.
6192355000831910 You think so?
6192355000831911 Well… no. In his condition, I'd rather he stayed put.
6192355000831912 Precisely.
6192355000831913 You convinced him that he's a toy. To what end?
6192355000831914 We all are. He's a toy, I'm a toy. Did you not know?
6192355000831915 You didn't mention me.
6192355000833051 To what do I owe the pleasure?
6192355000833052 Grief wants you to stop operations, lock up, and get lost.
6192355000833053 "The grass is always greener."
6192355000833054 "A long beak pecks millet."
6192355000833055 What's this bullshit?
6192355000833056 A password.
6192355000833057 You got a death wish?
6192355000833058 Do you?
6192355000833059 What a quick boy you are. Bad Grief's pal, huh? Well, Bad Grief's done. I'm in charge now.
6192355000833060 And who are you?
6192355000833061 Grief says hi.
6192355000833062 Nope.
6192355000833063 Go away. Lock the warehouse. And don't take anything with you.
6192355000833064 Well, I'm the one who drew the first knife. Ever heard of Barley the Barber?
6192355000833065 So those are your men cutting peaceful folk at night?
6192355000833066 Using knives is a rejection of the law.
6192355000833067 You've hurt an awful lot of people.
6192355000833068 Who's gonna stop us now? Whose law is it, forbidding knives?\nI'm done with your steppe preaching. Done. We're free people. If we wanna cut folks, we'll cut folks. I dare you to stop us.
6192355000833069 Oh, I <i>will.</i>
6192355000833070 He's not done.
6192355000833071 Done in our book. He bowed before the commissar wench and licked her boots—voluntarily!\nCouldn't have done worse if he'd tried. He's a mutt, not a leader.
6192355000833072 Which would make you the leader, correct?
6192355000833073 I won't get involved.
6192355000833074 We need to escape, Cub. Escape.
6192355000833075 You can't run from yourself, Grief.
6192355000833076 An' that's where you're wrong! Yourself, that's exactly who you should run from! Why would I want myself? A puppet on strings…
6192355000833077 You and puppets again!
6192355000833078 It's the only way to escape. Don't you get it? Fate belies freedom.\nYou're a toy. An' you can't become human while you have a fate. So you must break it! That's what your old man wanted from you!
6192355000833079 What do <i>you</i> know about what he wanted?!
6192355000833080 Every puppet plays a role.
6192355000833081 He tried to break his fate, an' the fate of the Town. So he died.
6192355000833082 What are you going on about?!
6192355000833083 Are you completely daft? I've been tellin' you for like an hour.\nYou aren't alive while you're part of someone else's design. Do you get it? That's why the sand pest came upon us, mowin' us down, and we do nothin'. How could we? Just toys…
6192355000833084 You're still out of it…
6192355000833085 I'm not escaping anywhere.
6192355000833086 Huh. Well… maybe you're right.
6192355000833087 How did you even arrive at this… philosophy?
6192355000833088 Where to?
6192355000833089 I'm tellin' you, she helped me understand. The woman. Here is the only place anything can be understood. We must stand by her.
6192355000833090 Oh, so she's no longer a wench to you?
6192355000833091 That's cowardly.
6192355000833092 No! It's not! I can't explain… sand pest kills the <i>unfree,</i> y'see?
6192355000833093 So?
6192355000833094 So don't play their games, not by their rules. Look at the big picture!
6192355000833095 What games? What rules?
6192355000833096 I don't.
6192355000833097 The designers of the whole thing.
6192355000833098 There's no design behind it all, Grief.
6192355000833099 It was "designed" by nature.
6192355000833100 Who cares! It's still a matter of freedom. Either you turn human an' survive, or stay a doll an' die. It's that simple.\nThe plague separates people from dolls. Got it?
6192355000833101 Hm. I thought about this myself…
6192355000833102 Grief. You're raving.
6192355000833103 You've never been much of a thinker. I think you might've short-circuited this time…
6192355000833104 No, not a wench. A woman.\nShe's almost human, y'know. At least she gets what's goin' on here. An' she opened my eyes, too.
6192355000833105 Opened your eyes to what?
6192355000833106 What a lovely, empathetic woman.
6192355000833107 What did you tell him? About people, and puppets?
6192355000833108 That is none of your concern, Burakh. It's his.
6192355000833109 That so? In that case, what <i>is</i> my concern?
6192355000833110 If you really plan to make that panacea of yours, do what you think is right. I'll cover for you.\nBut the order from the Town Hall was clear: All doctors are to work at the hospital, sharing their duties.\nYou are to report daily—and <i>work.</i> Or else there will be consequences.
6192355000833111 What can I do right now?
6192355000839391 Any suggestions?\nIn any case, this is now a hospital. Your place is here. Be so kind as to stay and do your job.
6192355000839392 I'll drop by, but I won't confine myself here. I have another plan.
6192355000839393 We need to make medicine. And I can't do that here.
6192355000839394 What consequences?
6192355000839395 You'll be removed from the Pest Fund lists and receive no monetary support.\nIn my book, Cub, it's not about the money, but a clear conscience. Your duties as a doctor.
6192355000839396 I'm not trying to slack off.
6192355000839397 I thought we already discussed my current duties.
6192355000839398 We're short on painkillers. Can you brew more?
6192355000839399 What about medicine? Is the hospital not supplied?
6192355000839400 Where would we take it from? Medicine stores? All stocks are running low, since the train wasn't here on time.\nThey'll requisition what they can. Dankovsky is in charge of that. But we need more right now.
6192355000839401 I'll try.
6192355000839402 I can.
6192355000839403 I'm low on resources myself.
6192355000839404 I'm… at a loss. I've never seen a serious outbreak. And this…
6192355000839405 Yeah…
6192355000839406 All right. I'll have a look at the patients.
6192355000839407 Listen. Was there really not a single recovery?
6192355000839408 Not a single one. Neither was there one five years ago. I don't know of any other such disease.
6192355000839409 Huh...
6192355000839410 Pneumonic plague. There was no salvation either. And no vaccines helped.
6192355000839411 So how's your panacea going?
6192355000839412 An oak isn't felled in one stroke.
6192355000839413 It's not a panacea! Where did you even get that word?
6192355000839414 …Too many corpses today. More than yesterday. They can barely cart them all away.
6192355000839415 How long does it take for the sand pest to kill a patient?
6192355000839416 Look, I really think you're being unfair to Grief.
6192355000839417 No one stayed alive for more than a day. If the patient has a weak constitution, or no medicine, it takes closer to eight hours.
6192355000839418 And antibiotics? Properly prescribed, they can extend their life…
6192355000839419 Ugh.
6192355000839420 Didn't take you long to forget your friend.
6192355000839421 I do not deny our old friendship. But I don't want to see him, not anymore—nor do I want to patch up his bandits.
6192355000839422 Bandit is too impressive a title. They're petty criminals.
6192355000839423 He helped you, hasn't he? With whatever it is you're doing in the Warehouses.
6192355000839424 Who drew knives? Who attacked people at night? His thugs! He cuts them loose! The man giving the orders deserves the blame.
6192355000839425 I don't think those are his men.
6192355000839426 Why not?
6192355000839427 He has no control over them. He admitted that himself.
6192355000839428 I don't believe that.
6192355000839429 Whatever.
6192355000839430 You don't believe him, you don't believe me. Do you even believe yourself?
6192355000839431 I remember Mentor talking about it. I always forget your steppe word… the three states? Is that what you mean?
6192355000839432 Yes.
6192355000839433 Could you at least find the right antibiotics for some patients here? Perhaps some would survive a day or two. Then you could rescue them with that panacea of yours.
6192355000839434 Is that my job for today?
6192355000839435 Where are they buried?
6192355000839436 The three Layers.
6192355000839437 I guess.
6192355000839438 All right. Consider it done.
6192355000839439 I'll need to brew the antibiotics first, or buy them… It'll take time.
6192355000839440 So you do believe I can do it, after all?
6192355000839441 I don't know. Ask Dankovsky. He manages it all. I just do my job.
6192355000839442 So there are still no recoveries?
6192355000839443 Ah, there you are…
6192355000839444 What's today's job?
6192355000839445 Stay strong. I think I'm making progress.
6192355000839446 I haven't been wasting time, either.
6192355000839447 What do you mean?
6192355000839448 So how's it made? Get blood with antibodies, mix with a tincture?
6192355000839449 You want to try yourself?
6192355000839450 Yes, more or less.
6192355000840553 I can see that. You look exhausted, Stakh. You need some rest.
6192355000840554 Today's job is downright ugly. Perfect for the likes of you and I. Autopsies—a lot of them.
6192355000840556 How many is "a lot"?
6192355000840557 Never mind.
6192355000840558 Are you hiding something?
6192355000840559 Substantial?
6192355000840560 I hope it will all come to fruition soon.
6192355000840561 Very substantial.
6192355000840562 I'd rather not guess. But you'll be the first to know when I succeed.
6192355000840563 We need organs—to study them. Infected, healthy… all kinds of them. Not blood, though. Orderlies can collect it without our help.\nI'll do most of the work, but that's no reason for you to slack off.
6192355000840564 What exactly will be studied?
6192355000840566 Examining infected organs makes sense, but why would we need healthy ones?
6192355000840567 What an opportunity for practice, Stakh! No one would blacklist you, either.
6192355000840568 I guess… but I just don't have the energy anymore for all this.
6192355000840569 I'll help you out. Autopsies, huh?
6192355000840570 The disease mutates. The clinical picture changes. They all have different symptoms…\nWe're no longer sure which organs become damaged first. So we'll have to figure it out.
6192355000840571 But how? We don't have a clinical picture. We know nothing!
6192355000840572 Leave that to Dankovsky. Our job is to extract the organs and put them in the ice box—there, on the stage. Let Dankovsky be the one to rummage through them.
6192355000840573 Oh, so this is all his idea? I see.
6192355000840574 You seem less like an adoring fan. That's nice to see.
6192355000840575 He works hard, but I've yet to see the results.
6192355000840576 If he's making the same progress I am, there's still hope.
6192355000840577 …Are you implying the same about me, I wonder?
6192355000840578 You know I never imply. I tell things straight.\nAnd… I shouldn't have said the things I said back then. Mentor would be proud of you now. He <i>was</i> proud of you.
6192355000840579 Peace, then?
6192355000840580 Peace.
6192355000840581 Let bygones be bygones.
6192355000840582 All's well that ends well.
6192355000840583 The show's over.
6192355000840584 I'm a doctor.
6192355000840585 It's not just a theatre, pal. There's a hospital inside.
6192355000840586 Entry's forbidden. There's nothing of interest inside. It's all over.
6192355000840587 What do you mean?
6192355000840588 We have received a clear report. Everyone who gets infected dies. There's no cure. There's no chance of salvation.\nSo why would you need a hospital? It only makes the germs swarm.
6192355000840589 Were you brought up at an apiary, pal…?
6192355000840590 Let me in, I'm telling you!
6192355000840591 But there is a chance. And there is a cure.
6192355000840592 You got it with you right now? You said you were a doctor, huh?
6192355000840593 I do. But not for you.
6192355000840594 I am. If I give you a cure, will you let me in?
6192355000840595 …This division doesn't disobey orders. The general is very strict about the chain of command.
6192355000840596 I can appreciate that.
6192355000840597 Yeah, General Ashes, beast of a man… I've heard a lot about him.
6192355000841351 We need an isolation ward. A huge building—"spacious," yes, that's the word I used. The Kains suggested the Cathedral. That's it. Nothing surprises me anymore.\nThen again, all a quarantined person has left is prayer.
6192355000841352 But it's a single space. No separate rooms.
6192355000841363 Do you plan to work today, doctor?
6192355000841364 What do we have today?
6192355000841366 A lot of patients died last night… They moaned for a while, and then they stopped. I guess some are still breathing. Nestling next to the corpses, twitching. Can't tell anymore…
6192355000841367 What? You've turned the hospital into a morgue!
6192355000841369 And who are you?
6192355000841370 Grigory Gorky, doctor. A coal-heaver. I'm a Kains' man.
6192355000841371 A coal-heaver? Why is there a coal-heaver in the hospital?
6192355000841372 Well… kinda. I guess.\nIf you yoke yourself to death's plough, you might as well claim you've done so voluntarily. Hurts your dignity less.
6192355000841374 What's today's job?
6192355000844751 …I've made up my mind, you know. If I survive all this, I leave.\nNever to return.
6192355000844752 Where would you go?
6192355000844753 I don't know. To the front.
6192355000844754 Very funny.
6192355000844755 Me too. Perhaps we should go together?
6192355000844756 I guess it's safer than here.
6192355000844757 [he's not dead, only sleeping]
6192355000844758 How are you, friend? Completely exhausted, huh?
6192355000844759 That's all right. Have some sleep.
6192355000844760 …………..
6192355000844761 Remember that time at the Scruff, when we had that fight? You said you're bound to this land. That you'd been born here, and will die here. That you didn't want me to leave… That's when it all went downhill between us, wasn't it?
6192355000844762 ……
6192355000844763 See how it turned out? I'm back, but you seem to be leaving. Father was the only thing that kept you anchored, wasn't he? You were loyal to the land because of him. Now, you're all alone. So you're running to death's embrace. Anywhere, away from here.
6192355000844764 Can you hear me?
6192355000844765 ……
6192355000844766 You could… stay. Father's gone, but perhaps someone could take his place in your heart. Maybe you could marry Lara. Become a father yourself. Things would turn around…
6192355000844767 All right, sleep some more. I'll stop pestering you.
6192355000844768 Well, you don't have to answer.
6192355000844825 Yulia. Yulia Lyuricheva. And you are…?
6192355000844826 Artemy Burakh. A doctor.
6192355000844827 Just a local ripper.
6192355000844828 Can I do anything?
6192355000844829 Why did you come?
6192355000844830 I just want to be of help.
6192355000844831 You're a scientist. There's no work for you here.
6192355000844832 How can I help you?
6192355000844833 What can you do?
6192355000844834 Little in the way of medicine. I'm a mathematician specializing in spatial calculations. The finite-element method… I doubt you'd be interested.
6192355000844835 Oh, but I am.
6192355000844836 You're not a local, right?
6192355000844837 Of course. I arrived at Simon Kain's request to lay out the roads and plan the Town's development.
6192355000844838 Huh… Our town doesn't look like it was planned by a mathematician.
6192355000844839 The Kains had a rather unusual notion of how they wanted the Town's routes planned. They believed the routes of choice influence people's mood. Their soulstate.\nI found the challenge intriguing, if a bit insane.
6192355000844840 "A bit"? The Kains are completely off their rocker.
6192355000844841 Well, they have built the Polyhedron, haven't they? There it is. I was even allowed to ascend it. Though I wasn't allowed inside…\nThe Cathedral, the Crucible, the Stillwater; all those buildings are machines that work with the same idea.
6192355000844842 What idea?
6192355000844843 So the Town's streets are your doing?
6192355000844844 Not all of them, but yes, to some extent.
6192355000844845 Why the hell did you make the Town so awkward to navigate, then?
6192355000844846 The Kains implied that the Town already has something akin to a nervous system. They suggested I view it as a huge, living creature. So my job was… acupunctural.
6192355000844847 Do you take the Kains' ideas seriously?
6192355000844849 No.
6192355000845851 It all failed. The isolation ward in the Cathedral, the hospital in the Theatre… Even the cemetery is an issue now.
6192355000845852 At least you tried.
6192355000845853 Why do you think it failed?
6192355000845854 Was there a single person who left this hospital healthy?
6192355000845856 But at least we studied the disease.
6192355000845857 But at least people had hope.
6192355000845858 The Town is dying. And now this inquisitor…\nThe Powers That Be know everything. They won't be lenient anymore.
6192355000845859 Yeah? What can they do? Send the Army?
6192355000845860 The Army… No, I don't suppose they would do that. What's the point? It would just be a waste of soldiers.
6192355000845861 Cheer up. We've found the cure already. Victory is at hand.
6192355000845862 See? It could have been even worse.
6192355000849851 Shh! Listen to swevery grow.
6192355000849852 Swevery?
6192355000849853 I can't hear anything.
6192355000849854 Here? Here, I guess… Here.
6192355000849855 All right. Go ahead, show me.
6192355000849856 It's beautiful here.
6192355000849857 Do you often come here alone? Aren't you scared?
6192355000849858 We need swevery. And twyre. A blade of each kind. It's pretty!
6192355000849859 It is, but I'm not sure what you want me to do.
6192355000849860 What was it… Murky? Look at me. Are you messing with me?
6192355000849861 Now you go pick grass!
6192355000849862 Which plants?
6192355000849863 I just told you! Swevery, and three kinds of twyre. Pretty blades. Don't you know which grass is magic?
6192355000849864 Why don't you do it yourself?
6192355000849865 All right…
6192355000849866 Okay, swevery and three kinds of twyre. Right. Now to fulfill my dream of being an errand boy…
6192355000849867 I will when I hear it call. But that takes time.
6192355000849868 Well, I'm in no hurry.
6192355000849869 Sure, I'll bring you back a whole bushel of herbs.
6192355000849870 No. I don't cheat.
6192355000849871 How do you know all that? About the dead?
6192355000849872 Because that's how I talk to mom and dad.
6192355000849873 They're… they're dead, yes?
6192355000849874 Perhaps you're only imagining that?
6192355000849875 No, I'm not! I'm not!
6192355000849876 Your mom and dad… Who were they?
6192355000849877 They died. Five years ago. Bad disease. A lot of people died.
6192355000849878 Five years ago?
6192355000849879 Where did it happen?
6192355000849880 Here. We lived in the Crude Sprawl.
6192355000849881 Five years ago? You're barely older than six.
6192355000849882 Oh my…
6192355000849883 Yes. Five years ago.
6192355000849884 How can you remember that? Impossible.
6192355000849885 Five years ago? You're barely older than six.
6192355000849886 I don't remember what happened. But mom and dad told me. It's true!
6192355000849887 All right, all right, I believe you.
6192355000849888 Why did I even come here…
6192355000849907 Yes, these are the right blades. Magic enough.
6192355000849908 How can you tell which herbs are magic?
6192355000849909 So what do we do now?
6192355000849910 What am I supposed to teach? You just need to want it really hard. Close your eyes tight, too. It'll happen.
6192355000849911 So it's all just… daydreaming?
6192355000849912 Ugh, kids. What did I expect? I knew nothing good would come of this.
6192355000849913 I did not lie. I did not. I don't need you. Nuh-uh. At all.
6192355000849914 Who cares if you need me!
6192355000849915 It's my own fault for taking a kid too seriously.
6192355000849916 What is there about you to love? I don't want to. Nuh-uh.
6192355000849917 I'm not imposing myself on you.
6192355000849918 …Don't you have anyone to wipe your face? You're all covered in dirt. See you, grumpy.
6192355000849919 The ones that grow from a person. A person-in-the-ground, I mean. Like mom and dad. You wanted to talk to your dad, right?
6192355000849920 I still do.
6192355000849921 I'm just wondering how you think it's possible.
6192355000849922 Go ahead, then. Talk to him.
6192355000849923 How? I thought you wanted to teach me.
6192355000849924 What do you mean? What nonsense is this?
6192355000849925 Will these ones do the trick?
6192355000849926 I've got everything already.
6192355000850051 The boös has an urgent matter do discuss with you, Master Burakh. It concerns your family home.
6192355000850052 It's always urgent with everyone… Tell him I'll drop by later today.
6192355000850053 And to this the boös told me to reply: "This matter has to be resolved before sundown. Otherwise you'll lose both the house and a large sum of money."
6192355000850054 Got it.
6192355000850055 This seems important. Let's go there right now.
6192355000850056 Very well. Lead the way.
6192355000850065 Thank you for the hospitality, boös. But I'll be on my way.
6192355000850068 Good thing you've come to visit, Master Burakh… Right on time… Early bird gets the worm, indeed. The Kains plan to take away your house. \nIsidor's dead, God rest his soul, and his heir is on the run… The decision will be made today.
6192355000850069 Why are the Kains even involved?
6192355000850070 You knew I was back. Wasn't your word enough?
6192355000850071 As you should know, the Town is ruled by three families…\nI hold the economy. The Abattoir, the Factory, the Station, the Warehouses… Known collectively as the Bull Enterprise. A silly name, but it stuck… Saburov upholds the peace, he handles the populace. And the Kains… the Kains build. Houses, other structures, general planning… All on them.
6192355000850072 I don't get it. Please explain.
6192355000850073 You don't know our history? That's a shame…\nThe Kains built our town on their fancy ideas… Composed an entire philosophy of town planning, heh heh. Experimenting on human souls, no less.\nThey see the Town as a machine. A tool. A special place, like a crucible for remaking the mind and spirit of man.
6192355000850074 What do they want to forge people into?
6192355000850075 I know this.
6192355000850076 That's harsh.
6192355000850077 Does it work?
6192355000850078 They want to forge an overman, one to rival God. Not even to forge one, but to let him grow up on his own. Idealistic airheads… That's who they are.\nMe, I pull the chain the other direction. Humans are beasts. The simpler, the more useful, heh heh… At least my little theory proves itself right with plentiful coin.
6192355000850079 Why do they want my father's house?
6192355000850080 Depends on how you look, Master Burakh… Oh, it depends. It's not for me to judge. I am a down-to-earth man, yes… I work with meat, not castles in the sky.\nBut at times, they build compelling things. They have a special interest in the spaces inside buildings.
6192355000850081 What kind of interest?
6192355000850082 Get to the point.
6192355000850083 The Kains see all houses, including yours, as cogs in a machine. They might decide to demolish it, or do something else entirely. \nThe late Simon Kain was close to your father. One could say they were friends. Opposites truly do attract… Yes, they do.
6192355000850084 So what do I do?
6192355000850085 Go see the Judge, that is, Georgiy Kain. With his brother Simon dead, he is in charge. Go to him and assert your claim… \nHurry. Georgiy wakes at dawn and never takes back decisions… That's just how he is.
6192355000850086 Thank you, boös.
6192355000850087 I don't want that house. Too many heavy feelings.
6192355000850088 If you don't want the house for yourself, I'll be happy to take it off you. I'll pay you good money for it… Never let a good thing go to waste, I always say. There's no changing the Kains' minds with money—they have enough. You, however, might succeed.\nGo see the Judge, and soon. It might be too late in an hour or two.
6192355000850089 Alright, I'll look into it.
6192355000850090 What do you propose we do?
6192355000850091 Let them have it.
6192355000850092 The Kains live in the Crucible, right?
6192355000850093 Can I help you?
6192355000850094 Are you the Judge?
6192355000850095 The Judge is in his workshop. What business brings you to him?
6192355000850096 Personal business.
6192355000850097 You're Artemy Burakh.
6192355000850098 How do you know?
6192355000851703 September's been rough this year.
6192355000851704 I thought you'd ask how I got into this coffin…
6192355000851705 And just who are you?
6192355000851706 Your companion.
6192355000851707 An eternal one, looks like.
6192355000851708 I've figured out who you are.
6192355000851709 You survived death. This is your victory. You're the only survivor.
6192355000851710 Survived… death? Is this some kind of joke?
6192355000851711 So I'm going to live forever now?
6192355000851712 …Only survivor?
6192355000851713 Why does the disease kill some, but not others? After all, it seemed like everyone could have fallen seriously, terminally ill.\nMaybe it's the same with death in general. We think it obliterates everyone. But if you act just so, your intellect can overcome death—just as your body overcomes plague or typhus!
6192355000851714 So how <i>do</i> you defeat death?
6192355000851715 Maybe. If you wanted to.
6192355000851716 Maybe I will.
6192355000851717 I don't think so. You bore me.
6192355000851718 Or maybe you're not the only one… I don't know how many you've managed to touch. Or will manage to.\nYou still have the entire rest of the day to share your goodbyes with whomever you wish, to touch a last few souls.
6192355000851719 Goodbyes? What's the point?
6192355000851720 Goodbyes? What's the point?
6192355000851721 How does one <i>survive</i> death?
6192355000851722 By realizing that death is not a vanishing. It's a boundary. You can step over any chasm if you're convinced it's just another obstacle.\nIt's naive to think victory over death means immortality. Immortality is tiring if you remain who you are. Much more so if you fall into decline.
6192355000851723 If not immortality, then what? Where's the answer?
6192355000851724 What have you done to the Town? And what has the Town done to you?\nYou wouldn't have been able to solve this problem without each other, different creatures as you are. An enormous town, a small person, an undetectably minuscule microbe. Three of you. You needed each other.
6192355000851725 And what exactly <i>have</i> I done to the Town?
6192355000851726 You understood it. You bound its severed parts together. Drawing new connections between things that seemed incompatible—that is the essence of understanding. To understand is to become someone else.\nWhat seemed like death to the former you is just a crack in the earth for the new you. It's still rather wide, but you can get across.
6192355000851727 As if the Town cared whether I understood it or not…
6192355000851728 You took pity on your town. You went where love led you. You decided the last of the miraculous creatures must not be deprived of their lives. You realized the plague itself was alive. You cherish everything alive.\nLook—the Town is grateful to you. It has changed.
6192355000851729 What's going to happen to its inhabitants?
6192355000851730 You've given your town a future. You've weaned it from the earth, and that's something. The nourishing umbilical cord must be severed at some point.
6192355000851731 Can we do without that?
6192355000851732 I don't know. I'm letting them go, you hear? I'm officially waiving my claim to them. Go say goodbye. They want to say goodbye to you, too.
6192355000851733 Thank you, fellow traveler. It matters.
6192355000851734 Yes. I should say farewell.
6192355000851738 The people will become free. They'll discover their destinies within the Town, and those destinies will shape it. They'll think of death how you've grown to think of death. Whoever survives something like this has nothing to fear.\nGo say goodbye to them.
6192355000851739 Not my kind of freedom. There's something… wrong, about all of this.
6192355000851740 I'll just say my goodbyes.
6192355000851863 What do you have there? Did you catch a tiny little mouse for me?
6192355000851864 I brought you something to eat, to return the favor. Take it.
6192355000851866 We knew it! We knew you'd do it! Lina didn't believe it, Barrel didn't believe it, but Tom-Tom and I knew it: He'll figure it out on his own, he doesn't need nudges or hints to bring us something back. And you did! \nYou're such a good person. Can I hug you?
6192355000851867 Not now, kid. I'm covered in blood.
6192355000851868 Go ahead.
6192355000851869 I think I should come here more often. Maybe I'll start believing I'm a good person, too.
6192355000858251 This place has been picked clean. Nothing more to loot. If you're feeling brave, check the neighboring houses. Maybe they have something left.
6192355000858255 Any luck with the house, Master Burakh?
6192355000858256 Plenty. Thank you for your counsel.
6192355000858257 First they locked the Termitary. Then the murders. Now the Factory's stopped—unheard of! Fat Vlad would work us to death with no rest or sleep, his domain never stops!\nAnd now they're cordoning off districts, too? What's going on?
6192355000858258 I wonder myself...
6192355000858259 An outbreak. There's an outbreak.
6192355000858260 Move aside and let me through.
6192355000858261 Grief comes in spades these days. Who could have known the Polyhedron will turn out this way?
6192355000858262 How did it turn out, exactly?
6192355000858263 Where is Georgiy?
6192355000858264 I am Isidor Burakh's son. I'm here about our house.
6192355000858265 The workshop is in the right wing of the mansion. We're in mourning today, but I think he'll want to meet you.
6192355000858266 You seem troubled.
6192355000858267 You're in mourning too?
6192355000858268 Yes. Simon, our patriarch, died two days ago under mysterious circumstances. Haven't you heard?
6192355000858269 I haven't.
6192355000858270 I have.
6192355000858271 Strange. The whole Town knows. People loved him. He was this village's creator, after all.
6192355000858272 …How old was he?
6192355000858273 Quite old. You're Burakh's son, so you must've spent your youth here. Haven't you heard stories of Simon?
6192355000858274 Of course I have.
6192355000858275 I heard he was a close friend of my father, who also died two days ago. An odd coincidence, don't you think?
6192355000858276 Odd indeed—if a coincidence at all. I hope Saburov's people can unravel this case.
6192355000858277 I hope so too.
6192355000858278 I'll unravel it myself.
6192355000858280 What is this thing you've built here? How does it stay upright?
6192355000858281 From the Capital, we have summoned the Stamatin brothers—two architects. They've come forth with a bold project: a contraption that defies gravity. \nIn the Capital, they were ridiculed. We thought differently, and so we granted them this opportunity. As you can see, the Polyhedron soars.
6192355000858282 I sense a but.
6192355000858283 But the Polyhedron took away our children. The Tower fascinates them. Inside, they've built something like a sovereign country, with my own son in charge. No one has any idea how to make them leave.
6192355000858284 Are you afraid that the Tower will collapse?
6192355000858285 No. It's just that the Tower… does something to them. They don't explain this to outsiders, but I think it materializes illusions. Some sort of optical effect. Vibrations too, of course…\nSimon was adamant that we do not hinder the children in any way. Claimed this was the entire reason for the construction. But… I want my son back.
6192355000858286 What's his name?
6192355000858287 Caspar. Kids call him Khan. He is their leader. I suppose, as his father, I should be proud.
6192355000858288 Khan. Wait… He was among the children my father taught.
6192355000858289 Yes. He and your father spent a lot of time together last year. \nSimon and Isidor gathered some kind of coterie of children. Ones they had special hopes for. I didn't have enough time to grasp the things those two taught our children.
6192355000858290 I see. I'd like to speak to Khan, if you don't mind.
6192355000858291 Well… They do come out from time to time. Less often than I'd like. \nAbandon any hope of entering the Polyhedron, though. They don't let adults in.
6192355000858292 I'm going to try anyway.
6192355000858293 Can you describe their teachings?
6192355000858294 I cannot. I'm sorry, but I just don't know. I trusted Simon and your father. They would not harm children.
6192355000858295 Is your son in the Tower right now?
6192355000858296 Why have you let them in?
6192355000858297 My brothers, Simon and Georgiy, insisted that we have to let children play. In a way, I agree with them. \nThis is why we Kains create all these buildings, after all. To change people.
6192355000858298 And it doesn't matter to you if they change people for the better or for worse, does it?
6192355000858299 Thank you. I'll go and see the Judge now.
6192355000858300 So those children are running wild now, living by their own laws?
6192355000858301 Don't ask me how that happened. There was no sinister plan behind this. In a single day people have accepted this state of affairs. \nThis town does strange things to us. I think this experiment might be out of our control now. No surprise, given that Simon is dead…
6192355000858302 And your son…
6192355000858303 I know you.
6192355000858304 A genius.
6192355000858305 Why are you here then?
6192355000858306 I wonder what sort of creature this Aspity is. Perhaps she can tell my fortune… As it is, I'm somewhat depressed.
6192355000858307 So you want to know the future?
6192355000858308 What exactly are you planning on asking her?
6192355000858311 Same. Nice to meet you.
6192355000858312 No. I know what the future holds for me. I'm simply curious.
6192355000858313 Curious about what?
6192355000858314 I wonder how long my tower will hold. I wonder if Farkhad forgave me… if Brother is angry with me… I wonder about many things.
6192355000858315 The Tower… You mean the one that grew in the Stone Yard?
6192355000858316 All right. See you.
6192355000858317 "Grew"? It isn't a weed. We built it. Or don't you like it?
6192355000858318 It's… impressive.
6192355000858319 It scares me.
6192355000858320 I do.
6192355000858321 Who is Farkhad?
6192355000858322 A talented corpse. A capable architect, though far below my league. He built the Cathedral.
6192355000858323 Ah! I see.
6192355000858324 I remember his grave in the Cemetery. The one with the eye.
6192355000858325 My brother and I built it. Killed him ourselves, buried him ourselves.
6192355000858326 I see.
6192355000858327 So that's why you drink, huh? An uneasy conscience is a heavy burden.
6192355000858851 
6192355000858852 
6192355000858853 Something's brewing in Grief's soul. He asked me to disperse his old crowd and lock up the Warehouse.
6192355000858854 Bad Grief asked to disperse his old crowd and lock up the Warehouse. Not a fan of the idea…
6192355000858855 
6192355000858856 
6192355000858857 I'm a coward.
6192355000858858 I killed Barley. Grief's old business is over.

6192355000863484 Are you the prefect of this district?
6192355000863485 In the flesh.
6192355000863486 Isn't your job keeping people's things in their houses, and not the other way around?
6192355000863487 Good, I was looking for you. As Isidor's son and heir, I claim our house. Here is a paper from the Judge.
6192355000863488 That's a fancy paper indeed, but I'm afraid you won't be living in that house anytime soon.
6192355000863489 The house belongs to me.
6192355000863490 What the hell do you mean?
6192355000863491 What I said. These things belong to everyone now. The owners have fled. You may take whatever they left.
6192355000863492 Why are you so calm at a time like this?
6192355000863493 Where did they go?
6192355000863494 Damned if I know. Somewhere the soot won't reach them, I reckon.
6192355000863495 Why haven't you left with them?
6192355000863496 I have a job to do.
6192355000863497 You must be the local prefect.
6192355000863498 Haven't you been outside? The air's no longer fit to breathe. I heard there was a blowout at the Factory yesterday, must be the soot settling down, choking people to death.
6192355000863499 So what now?
6192355000863500 What do you mean?
6192355000863501 The poor and the brave might still be around, trying to salvage what little they can. It was decided that doctors and medical personnel may take whatever they need, since they likely need it more. You're a doctor too, as far as I know.
6192355000863502 So, I may take whatever I want?
6192355000863505 You may, if you're not afraid of the soot.
6192355000863506 All right.
6192355000863507 And no one is going to object?
6192355000863508 If you manage to help someone in the end, they might thank you instead.
6192355000863509 I see.
6192355000863510 I don't think this stuff is soot.
6192355000863511 What is it, then?
6192355000863512 Something contagious. Did anyone else stay behind, besides you?
6192355000863513 The townsfolk are running scared. The black stuff will dry a man's lungs in a second. I heard of several being dead already…
6192355000863514 I'm off to gather supplies. Maybe I can still find something useful.
6192355000863515 Take the paper. Black stuff or no black stuff, the house is mine now.
6192355000863516 It's miasma, not soot. Take the papers and go straight to the Theatre. There will be a hospital there soon.
6192355000868651 Mark Immortell
6192355000868675 …Is it my line now? Oh yes, you're right. Here I go: "Go back, my friend; the door is over there!"
6192355000868676 Out, you mean?
6192355000868678 How did I get here?
6192355000868679 Oh no, no. Wrong line. Let's try again: "I was dead."
6192355000868680 I was dead…
6192355000868681 So I wasn't completely dead…
6192355000868682 And then: "Death is never quick. Understanding is a process. Unpleasant, but unavoidable." \nWhat is but a moment for an external observer might feel like a day inside. Or a week. Or, if you're particularly unlucky, a year.
6192355000868683 Is this it? Can I go now?
6192355000868684 A week sounds fine.
6192355000868685 No. I'm not dead yet.
6192355000868686 Oh, but nothing is over yet. Although, it's in your interest to make sure your first death experience, henceforth simply "death," is also your last.
6192355000868687 Why?
6192355000868689 As a director of our theatre, I will now inform you of the most important pillar of your role. Silence in the audience!\nSo. With each death of a new actor, we will all face irreversible consequences. Got it? Irreversible!
6192355000868690 "Irreversible"?
6192355000868694 Any actor who continues Burakh's path in place of the previous Burakh will have it harder than their predecessor. Such is the theatre of cruelty.\nEach death makes the role harder. You will become burdened with the consequences of your predecessors' deaths… Their <i>negligence.</i>
6192355000868695 What sort of consequences?
6192355000868696 I don't want this role!
6192355000868697 I warned you. Each new attempt will be harder. When one actor dies, the next finds themselves even closer to the abyss.\nTry to finish this piece in one go. You personally, so that no one has to replace you. Have pity on your successor.
6192355000868698 I've no intention to die.
6192355000868699 I'll touch clocks more often from now on. Forewarned, forearmed.
6192355000868700 Unpleasant and painful. You won't be able to make a step without a drink of water—how's that? What about being unable to touch a close one? Or growing as weak as a five-year-old child?\nYour life force has already dwindled. And it will keep dwindling with each consequent death. Each and every one of them!
6192355000868701 This is absurd…
6192355000868702 That's fine. I don't fear challenges. They make it all the more engaging.

6192355000869056 Today, I need to lower the patients' pain. There are some painkillers in the hospital, but I'll need to obtain the rest myself.
6192355000869057 Done with my shift for today. Tomorrow the Fund will reward me, and new work will become available at the hospital.
6192355000869059 Today, the patients haven't been taken care of. The Fund will not reward me tomorrow, but there'll be more work at the hospital.
6192355000869060 Today's task is tough: I need to administer correct antibiotics to three patients. I'd better diagnose them with tinctures first.\n\nSome medicine is stocked in the hospital, but the rest I'll have to obtain myself.
6192355000869151 So you're Old Burakh's son?
6192355000869152 Yes.
6192355000869164 This district is locked down. Under Doctor Dankovsky's orders, these districts are off-limits to anyone but medical personnel. Are you that Vorakh guy?

6192355000869166 Well, I'm a doctor.
6192355000869167 Immunity boosters: two pills. Protective clothes: one unit. Here you go.
6192355000869168 Pills… pills are good.
6192355000869169 Protective clothes? Good idea. That area looks unclean. Very unclean…
6192355000869170 This district is infected. Listen carefully: I'll explain what you need in order to stay alive.

6192355000872351 Stand still, yargachin. Can you hear it?
6192355000872352 Some sort of grumbling... or groaning? I do.
6192355000872353 Come closer. Stand in front of me. And wait.
6192355000872354 Wait for what?
6192355000872355 The Earth is breathing. Listen to it. Stand still and listen. The Earth, our Mother Boddho, is in pain... sobolon, yadaral... reveal her vein, and she will reward you. Embrace you. Return your mother's embrace.
6192355000872356 All right, I'm standing still.
6192355000872358 Who are you?
6192355000872359 Boleesh, boleesh, don't go! You're listening wrong.\nThe closer you are to a yadaral, a vein, the louder it is. The longer you listen, the more likely you are to split the soil open and reveal the vein. Stand still, don't move. Can you hear Mother Boddho sing? Come closer.

6192355000872753 Of course. It's a tincture made from herbs.
6192355000872754 Good. Now let's get down to curing people. What always comes first?
6192355000872755 Diagnostics.
6192355000872756 It is time for the most important part. Do you remember what a mete is?
6192355000872757 I do. It is one of the three Layers in a body.
6192355000872758 An ulmar of every color is linked to a specific Layer. Tell me how.
6192355000872759 It can only reveal the symptoms on that Layer.
6192355000872760 Now you know which Layer the illness is hiding on. It's time to administer antibiotics.
6192355000872761 A single one, right?
6192355000872762 How could you let it happen?
6192355000872763 Sorry… I'm too exhausted.
6192355000872766 I hear you now. Speak, but waste no breath.
6192355000872767 I remember you, tumbler toy. Used to pretend you were alive when I was little.
6192355000872768 Ah, my old friend. No one better to talk with than my own damn self.
6192355000872769 You're trying to mimic Father? Stop. His death hurts enough as it is.
6192355000872791 See… that wasn't so hard. Soon you will remember everything.\nYou'll make a great healer. A healer I'll be proud of.
6192355000872792 I'm so sorry you won't be around to see it, Father.
6192355000872793 Our mom has some sort of wicked disease, doctor. Can you give my li'l sister something to keep her safe? She's a frail one…\nThis September is truly foul…
6192355000872794 It is indeed.
6192355000872795 Will you teach me all this stuff? Mixing the herbs, choosing the right ones, all that…
6192355000872796 If you prove to be smart, I might.
6192355000872797 It'll take a while to figure out all these herbs. Didn't Old Burakh leave you any notes?
6192355000872798 I have a single letter left. Not a word about herbs in it, though.
6192355000872799 You know what I just remembered? Your old man once told me that the herbs suppress each other. Like in a circle.
6192355000872800 What do you mean, in a circle?
6192355000873151 I failed today's task. A patient died. The Fund will not reward me tomorrow, but there'll be more work at the hospital.
6192355000873152 I failed the task. Too many dead. The Fund will not reward me tomorrow, but new work will become available at the hospital.
6192355000873154 I need to perform autopsies for today's work. I need to put at least six organs into the ice box on the stage. Blood won't do.
6192355000873155 Done with my shift for today. Tomorrow the Fund will reward me, and new work will become available at the hospital.
6192355000873156 Today, I didn't complete my work at the hospital. The Fund will not reward me tomorrow, but new work will become available.
6192355000873157 
6192355000873158 
6192355000873159 
6192355000873160 
6192355000873161 
6192355000873162 Today, I need to find survivors among the piles of corpses and put them back in beds, where they can receive proper treatment.
6192355000873163 Done with my shift for today. Tomorrow the Fund will reward me, and new work will become available at the hospital.
6192355000873164 Today, the patients haven't been cared for. The Fund will not reward me tomorrow, but new work will become available at the hospital.
6192355000873165 I failed today's task. A patient died. The Fund will not reward me tomorrow, but there'll be more work at the hospital.
6192355000873166 All I need to do today is stay in the hospital for an hour without going out. Sounds simple enough…
6192355000873167 
6192355000873168 
6192355000873169 They were late, but did come after all!\n\nDone with my shift for today. Tomorrow the Fund will reward me, and new work will become available at the hospital.
6192355000873170 This is bullshit. I won't waste my time. The Fund will not reward me tomorrow, but new work will become available at the hospital.
6192355000873171 
6192355000873172 
6192355000873173 A doctor will always find work in a hospital. I should drop by here from time to time.
6192355000873174 
6192355000873175 
6192355000873176 
6192355000873177 
6192355000873178 
6192355000873179 
6192355000873180 
6192355000873181 
6192355000873182 
6192355000873183 
6192355000873184 
6192355000873185 
6192355000873186 
6192355000873187 I wonder where Stakh is.
6192355000873188 No doctors or orderlies in the hospital… Only Clara the Changeling, who begs to cure a patient. As in, completely cure, not just treat.\n\nThis will require a shmowder, or a panacea.
6192355000873189 I fulfilled Clara's request and cured a patient. That was a kind deed. We'll see tomorrow it the Fund cares.
6192355000873190 I didn't fulfill Clara's plea. The Fund will not reward me tomorrow. The hospital stands almost empty…
6192355000873191 I didn't attend the hospital yesterday. New work will be available there in the morning.
6192355000873192 I didn't attend the hospital yesterday. New work will be available there in the morning.
6192355000873193 The hospital is closed.
6192355000873194 
6192355000873195 
6192355000873196 Rubin is tired. Dead tired. I can't help him with that. He'll either make it on his own… or not.
6192355000874154 Now, he would've said: "This place is our true home. One can work here."
6192355000874155 Even though I've never been here before.
6192355000874156 Yes. Home is where your work is.
6192355000874157 You can sleep here.
6192355000874158 I can store my things here. Not like I can carry everything around.
6192355000874160 You can perform operations here. And, of course, make medicines.
6192355000874161 …Without being disturbed by anyone.
6192355000874162 My bag is a bit small, that's true. Here I can fix that eventually.
6192355000874163 This is a good hideout. The door has a strong lock, and not many people know about this lair.
6192355000874164 …You were a true master. I'm not fit to fill your shoes.
6192355000874165 "Live here, Son. Live here and continue our work. This place is yours now. Here, you can do anything."
6192355000874166 Like speaking to my childhood toy.
6192355000874167 I know, tumbler toy. I know.
6192355000874168 "Here, you can do anything." That's exactly what he would have said.
6192355000874851 I hear you now. Speak, but waste no breath.
6192355000874852 I remember you, tumbler toy. Used to pretend you were alive when I was little.
6192355000874853 Ah, my old friend. No one better to talk with than my own damn self.
6192355000874854 You're trying to mimic Father? Stop. His death hurts enough as it is.
6192355000874855 And then he would've said: "This place is our true home. This is where we performed our work."
6192355000874856 Here you taught me the craft.
6192355000874857 Yes. Home is where your work is.
6192355000874858 You can sleep here.
6192355000874859 I can store my things here. Not like I can carry everything around.
6192355000874860 My bag is a bit small, that's true. Here I can fix that eventually.
6192355000874861 This is a good hideout. The door has a strong lock, and not many people know about this place.
6192355000874862 You can perform operations here. And, of course, make medicines.
6192355000874863 …Without being disturbed by anyone.
6192355000874864 …You were a true master. I'm not fit to fill your shoes.
6192355000874865 "Live here, Son. Live here and continue our work. This place is yours now. Here, you can do anything."
6192355000874866 Like speaking to my childhood toy.
6192355000874867 I know, tumbler toy. I know.
6192355000874868 "Here, you can do anything." That's exactly what he would have said.
6192355000874870 Correct. Tinctures are the foundation of every treatment. The Steppe has graced us with its wondrous herbs. Twyre, the queen of plants. Swevery. Ashen swish. White whip. Tell me, what's so good about them?
6192355000874871 They can uncover the symptoms of a disease.
6192355000874872 Uh… They have astringent properties, I believe… and thus improve immunity. Properly prepared, a good tincture is a powerful booster.
6192355000874873 Correct. They reveal the symptoms of a disease and improve immunity. How would you make a tincture?
6192355000874874 With clear water. No ethanol. Steppe herbs are too delicate.
6192355000874875 I need to combine any two different herbs. This way, a link will form.
6192355000874876 Unente: Clear water and two different herbs. You can find both here, look in the cabinet. Make a single ulmar for a start.
6192355000874877 All right.
6192355000874878 Be khara, this place is well stocked. You've always been thrifty, old man.
6192355000874879 Just don't let your mother get close to her while she's sick.
6192355000874880 Our place is cramped. We can't make her sleep in the street, can we?
6192355000874881 Fair enough.
6192355000874882 Let's take a look at your sister…
6192355000874883 Father taught me when I was your age, so why not?
6192355000874884 I just fixed it, didn't you notice?
6192355000874885 Hello? Anyone in there? Can you hear me?\nFor a moment, you just stood there… feeling bad, maybe? The air's thick here in September; breathe in too deep and you'll pass out.
6192355000874886 I was just remembering Father.
6192355000874887 I'm fine, you little familiar. And healthy. And I don't pass out.
6192355000874888 We need to determine which Layer hides the sickness.
6192355000874889 An examination.
6192355000874890 Correct again. But you are forgetting something. Pain. \nPain is our great ally. It reminds us we're still alive. It drives us to action. However, when a patient is in unbearable pain, we cannot uncover which Layer has come out of balance.
6192355000874891 Of course. We must keep the pain in check.
6192355000874892 Not to mention that using ulmars hurts the patient as well.
6192355000874893 Don't get smart with me, boy. We'll get to ulmars soon enough. For now, get to work. Relieve his pain.
6192355000874894 I'm not being smart. Just grumpy.
6192355000874895 You're better off without preparing ulmars that relieve pain. That knowledge is taboo. Stick to morphine and you'll be fine. Any medicine is fine if it lets you avoid making cuts.
6192355000874896 I'll stick to morphine.
6192355000874897 It was you who sent me to study clinical medicine. Things are done differently there.
6192355000874898 I'm not cutting anyone yet, am I?
6192355000874899 Don't worry. We have time.
6192355000874900 They are bones, nerves, and flesh. This has always struck me as strange—what about blood and internal organs? And why aren't bones the deepest Layer?
6192355000874901 I told you time and again that triangular plots ruin imagination. I also told you that our ancestors perceived the world as a single whole, and treasured its many links and connections. Respect the clarity of thought they possessed. \nWhat is the most important part in your knowledge of the Layers?
6192355000874902 Any disease always hides within one of the three. At first, at least.
6192355000874903 Remind me.
6192355000874904 A body is governed by three Layers. Whatever illness grips the body turns this harmony into a conflict between them, and thus kills. Look inside a body, and you shall see. \nThese Layers are called "mete."
6192355000874905 So, which parts of the body do they refer to?
6192355000874906 In different times different people have named different parts. Don't waste your time with the clinical approach. Folk medicine requires a different worldview.
6192355000874907 Why?
6192355000874908 How do the ulmars and different herbs correspond to these Layers? 
6192355000874909 Every combination of herbs is linked to a single Layer.
6192355000874910 I remember now.
6192355000874911 Very well. Let's get back to healing.
6192355000874912 Knowing the exact nature of an illness is not necessary for healing. Affecting the correct Layer, however, can bring a patient back to normal.
6192355000874913 You can link them to colors for mnemonics. White, yellow, rusty.
6192355000874914 An ulmar can only reveal symptoms of the Layer of the same color.
6192355000874915 Let's say you're making an ulmar from two herbs. How do you know which color you will get?
6192355000874916 One of the herbs decides.
6192355000874917 How am I supposed to remember all the properties of all the herbs?
6192355000874918 If memory fails you, there is nothing I can do to help. You're talking to yourself, remember?
6192355000874919 I remember.
6192355000874922 You will learn the properties of herbs in due time. Only this way will you understand how things are connected. Grab more herbs and water. Prepare an ulmar of every color. Go in blind for now, and the herbs will reveal themselves to you. \nTry again and again. That is how you'll learn to link things together.
6192355000874923 Three tinctures. One of each color. I'll try.
6192355000874924 I know, I know. No one can teach me now, so I'll have to learn it all myself.
6192355000874925 I got carried away. For a moment, I thought I could really hear your voice, Father.
6192355000874926 Yes. You can only administer a single one. Antibiotics are harmful, as you know. \nYou'll learn to make your own, but later. For now, you can use pills. There should be a stash around here somewhere. Choose the correct one.
6192355000874927 I know.
6192355000874928 Of which there are three kinds, as well.
6192355000874929 That's true.
6192355000874930 I shouldn't give too many at once... Too big of a risk.
6192355000874931 Now there's no room for mistakes left.
6192355000874932 I knew that was the wrong antibiotic. I also remember it's all in my head. It's just medical humor. Don't worry, Dad.
6192355000874933 It is hard. But I'm not afraid of hard work.
6192355000874934 All right… Goodbye, tumbler. Playtime is over. Time to get to business.
6192355000877551 A store-bought cure, or tincture brewed from herbs, would help them stay alive another day.
6192355000877552 Lucky me. I happen to have some.
6192355000877553 I think I was given some… but I've used them.
6192355000877557 The doctor saves himself to save the flock. That's wise. Take this, and give it to the patient.
6192355000877558 Thanks.
6192355000877559 Near-human, you must act. These doll cocoons may one day become real, and need your help.
6192355000877560 Thanks.
6192355000878551 Correct. However, there is a catch. What do you think it is?
6192355000878552 Symptoms can be misleading.
6192355000878553 A single symptom may be connected to several Layers at once.
6192355000878554 One can't always immediately uncover the symptom that pinpoints a single Layer as the one out of balance.
6192355000878555 Yes. Your job is to eliminate all the wrong possibilities.
6192355000878556 Yet every single tincture I give the patient hurts them.
6192355000878557 That is so. You have to keep an eye out for pain levels. \nIt is time to act, Son. Uncover the symptoms. Determine which Layer is out of balance. Do your best to use as few ulmars as possible. You have everything you need.
6192355000878558 I'll be observant.
6192355000878559 I'll be careful.
6192355000878560 No, they don't. Any one herb can be mixed with any other.
6192355000878565 Blood twyre dampens the black. Black twyre beats the brown. And the brown drowns the bloody, I guess.
6192355000878566 Huh. I can work with that.
6192355000878567 You know, I'm starting to remember this, too.
6192355000879951 All done. Tomorrow the Fund will reward me, and new work will become available at the hospital.
6192355000879952 Today, the patients haven't been taken care of. The Fund will not reward me tomorrow, but there'll be more work at the hospital.
6192355000880468 I've got bad news.
6192355000880469 Could it get any worse…?
6192355000880470 Well?
6192355000880471 Someone sharing your features spilled blood. It became known. People want revenge.\nThey say that whoever murdered the three men at the Station today is also responsible for Simon Kain's death.
6192355000880472 Yeah? What else are they responsible for?
6192355000880473 What else? You won't like it.\nThe townsfolk realized murder's no longer taboo. People sensed they can now kill others.\nFirst, they looked for a shabnak-adyg and killed several women. Then, they went after the steppe creatures, odonghs. They're frightened. They turned to animals.
6192355000880474 What does this have to do with me?
6192355000880475 You have nothing to do with it, I know. I'm a ferryman. Well… Almost. Actually, I'm a train driver. I know you were on my train.
6192355000880476 I wasn't alone, by the way…
6192355000880479 But you were. We drivers can feel the living weight. There was only one human being on that train. You.
6192355000880480 Odd.
6192355000880481 It was self-defense. I had to draw a knife.
6192355000880482 Draw a knife? Bad idea. Nothing is worse than cutting a body. You think if your father was allowed to, so are you? You are not him.
6192355000880483 Actually, I'm a surgeon too, now. That's why I went away, to study.
6192355000880484 Hm. I had suspected it was just a dream…
6192355000880485 The townsfolk aren't too fond of ferrymen and drivers. So we will help you.\nGo to a quay, show your face to a Worm, and he'll take you wherever you ask for a fingernail. Show your face to a man, and he'll help you out with equipment.
6192355000880486 Thank you.
6192355000880487 I have a fingernail already.
6192355000880488 I know.
6192355000880489 So they seek to punish murder by turning to murder themselves?
6192355000880490 …Have there been many victims?
6192355000880491 Yes. But you're too filled with your own grief now to care.
6192355000880492 Fair enough.
6192355000880493 You're wrong.
6192355000880496 It's like a craze. It's September, you know. Steppe herbs are in bloom…
6192355000880497 Yeah, right. <i>Of course</i> the herbs are to blame.
6192355000880498 Unbelievable.
6192355000880499 And you are…?
6192355000880500 A ferryman.
6192355000880501 What do you want?
6192355000880502 Different combinations of herbs will reveal different symptoms. However, all tinctures boost immunity. This effect comes from the soil, not from the herbs themselves.
6192355000880507 Today is Meat Day, tangher. We feast on meat.
6192355000880508 What are you celebrating, Khatangher?
6192355000880509 Khatanghe brought meat this morning. Said a warehouse door was left unlocked. So we took some.\nBoös Vlad grows fatter by the day. He works, he takes the profit. So we've decided to take the meat, at least.
6192355000880510 Is it at least fresh?
6192355000880511 She must be offended… or ashamed? She's free to go, we told her, but she refuses.\nI'll have you know, we were respectful! We only checked her legs. It's mandatory. And she had normal human legs. So, free to go now! Yet there she stands.
6192355000880512 You checked her legs? What for?
6192355000880513 Neither clay nor bone. She's a normal living girl, not a shabnak. And so, she's free to go.\nYet she doesn't… She must be offended. The steppe people have odd morals. They don't fear death, they refuse to cut a body, and are ashamed of strange things.
6192355000880514 What shabnak?
6192355000881351 An extinct creature, now. What were you planning on asking?
6192355000883251 Tumbler Human
6192355000883252 I've already made them.
6192355000884962 Yamar berkhe, yargachin. He who knows how to dissect people, can dissect Earth. Sayntadaa, emshen... Now partake of my blood. Let my blood feed the earth.
6192355000884964 Everyone knows how it works. You quench Earth's thirst with blood; you reap its harvest. Try it.
6192355000884965 I do have blood already though. I don't need yours.
6192355000884966 What for?
6192355000885351 Twyrine uncovers that which is hidden. Every sip will reveal a secret event or location to me.
6192355000885352 
6192355000885353 There are ferrymen in the town. They're waiting for me.
6192355000886457 Watch the herbs grow. Listen to them sing. You'll find them by the song, by the sound. Mother Boddho reveals herself to the generous.\nCome back tomorrow, khayaala. Feed her more blood, reap more herbs.
6192355000886458 Bayartay, basaghan.

6192355000887552 
6192355000887553 
6192355000887554 I made tinctures of all three colors. Time for diagnostics.
6192355000887555 
6192355000887556 
6192355000887557 
6192355000887558 
6192355000887559 A tincture is a mixture of water and herbs.
6192355000887560 
6192355000887561 Tinctures are brewed from various herbs: twyre, swevery, ashen swish, and white whip.
6192355000887562 
6192355000887563 
6192355000887564 
6192355000887566 
6192355000887567 Tinctures hurt patients. When they're in too much pain, I can't figure out which of their Layers is sick.
6192355000887568 Morphine can relieve a patient's pain.
6192355000887569 Three types of medicine are used to heal people: tinctures, painkillers, and antibiotics.
6192355000887570 Antibiotics lower the level of infection.
6192355000887571 Knowing the precise strain of the disease, I can give the patient the correct antibiotic.
6192355000887572 Father used to practice steppe medicine. Time to follow in his footsteps.

6192355000888252 I need to make one tincture of each color.
6192355000888253 Now I can cure people with tinctures and store-bought medicine.
6192355000889851 
6192355000889852 
6192355000889873 Hey, Gubar! The doctor's here, our shift's over.
6192355000889874 Who are you?
6192355000889875 You are indeed relieved for now.
6192355000889876 Grigory Gorky, Orderly #6. Even number, unfortunately.\nMy partner, Avrely Gubar, is luckier.
6192355000889877 How so?
6192355000889878 You're both alive—so you're equally lucky.
6192355000889879 Exactly. Death follows even numbers, didn't you know?\nWe've been keeping tabs on this statistic for a while now. Wherever there's a two, there's the grim reaper.
6192355000889880 Curious… Any explanation for this?
6192355000889881 I'll add it to my collection of superstitions.
6192355000889882 It's 'cause suffering tears the soul in two! And death keeps an eye on such moments.\nPah! But that's all just poetry. What I'm saying is, where there's an even number, someone dies. Even numbers are just unlucky.
6192355000889883 Okay. What's today's job?
6192355000889885 To check this exact theory. But you ain't in danger, doctor, 'cause you're the one and only! And death avoids ones. It's afraid to prick its finger on 'em.\nAll in all, you just gotta wait here for an hour until you're relieved.
6192355000889886 An hour?
6192355000889887 You got enough medicine? Any protective clothing? Even a piece of cloth would do.\nThe air here is thick; breathing it is like eating infection with a spoon. A really big one.
6192355000889888 I have everything I need.
6192355000889889 Wait a bit. I'll resupply and come back here.
6192355000889890 Good.\nWe won't lock the door, out of respect. Resolve is only heroic as long as there was a choice. But doctor Burakh is not the type to run away. Are you?
6192355000889891 I'm not.
6192355000889892 Watch your tone.
6192355000889893 ...Oops. My deepest apologies. That was merely a polite turn of phrase.\nOur shift is over, so we can't wait here anymore. We don't make the rules. So we're leaving. The rest is up to you: either wait for an hour or scurry out the door... failing is an option too, after all.
6192355000889894 I'll be quick.
6192355000889895 Orderly
6192355000891151 
6192355000891172 Clara
6192355000891173 Orderly
6192355000891174 I can't do it… I can't do anything!
6192355000891175 What are you doing here?
6192355000891176 I wanted to convince the general… He was the only one who believed me! He did! Don't you see? Just him! His officers looked at him as though he'd become a different person. As though talking to me stained him somehow…\nBut he did! And I wanted to prove… to show I have a healing touch.
6192355000891177 But in truth, you don't?
6192355000891178 I do… But something's wrong with me today. It doesn't work!
6192355000891179 So you've promised your general you'll cure someone? Get rid of the plague completely?
6192355000891180 Did it… really work before?
6192355000891181 Really?\nI only need to cure a single person… Just a single one!
6192355000891182 Really. I have a cure.
6192355000891183 But that would be a trick. You won't actually be the one doing the healing. Is that fine by you? I thought you were so righteous.
6192355000891184 A trick… Tricking others is wrong. For me, anyway.\nBut giving them hope is more important. Showing that there is a salvation. And if that means I have to sin, well… it's… it's all right, I guess. Their souls are more important than mine.
6192355000891185 Give hope to whom? That commander of yours? Or his officers?
6192355000891186 Don't sin, then. Tell them the truth: there is a salvation, and it's in Doctor Burakh's hands.
6192355000891187 No! These poor souls… Even if only one gets better, the rest will hope, and cling to life, and thus endure and survive.\nPeople only die when they resign themselves and give up. Didn't you know?
6192355000891188 Fine. I'll help.
6192355000891190 What will you treat him with?
6192355000891191 You won't like it. A children's "shmowder."
6192355000891192 A panacea. That's what people call it. I made it myself.
6192355000891193 I've got nothing on me right now, but I'll find a healing item for him. You stay here and try your method again.
6192355000891194 Of course!
6192355000891195 So you've promised your general you'll cure someone? Get rid of the plague completely?
6192355000891651 
6192355000891652 
6192355000891653 Greetings, Doctor Burakh. I came to relieve you of your duty.
6192355000893851 I don't eat other people's meat.
6192355000895851 This person lives, but mortal peril looms. The sand pest chokes their district, floods the streets.
6192355000895852 I can see that.
6192355000895853 Immunity protects each person here. Some have a long one; others, but a short. The span of one's is long; another's, short.
6192355000895854 …What? I never thought immunity could be measured in centimeters.
6192355000895855 As long as people stay indoors, they're not in danger.
6192355000895856 Walls <i>can</i> protect—but people still breathe air. The window sashes aren't the most secure. Some mice and bugs creep in to houses, too. And no one knows just how the plague is spread.
6192355000895857 Yeah. We should do everything we can to find that out.
6192355000895858 Isn't it kind of rude to talk about her in the third person like she can't hear you?
6192355000895859 She is one person; you are another. And I, the third, must speak this way. But <i>are</i> we people, all of us, you think? 
6192355000895860 Fair enough.
6192355000895861 A dice roll makes a clearer picture, sir: At midnight, Death will roll his dice to see if he rolls high, this one will perish; if he rolls low, they live one day more. Your part, Burakh, is but to adjust the odds.
6192355000895862 To the maximum?
6192355000895863 To some degree. If the dice has six sides, you can at times be guaranteed a five. As in—Death always has a chance to win with six. But even Death can't guarantee a six.
6192355000895864 It can't always, but it often does.
6192355000895865 …By raising their immunity, yes. I'm not completely clueless, you know.
6192355000895866 I know, Reflection. You don't need to explain further.
6192355000895867 I've heard that Death prefers chess.
6192355000895868 You are a doctor—<i>surgeon!</i>—stick with dice! Since you have means to cheat, and Death does not.
6192355000895869 I'm no good at cheating…
6192355000895870 I can cheat? Teach me, then, master gambler.
6192355000895871 This person weakly rolls a die, the way someone who's barely human would. They can't roll higher than a three without some help. And truth be told, they'll likely roll a one. \nSo you come here and turn the die just so, so that a larger number faces up.
6192355000895872 Huh…
6192355000895873 That sounds a bit… hopeless.
6192355000895874 Couldn't <i>you</i> have just given it to the patient? Why do you even need me?
6192355000895875 Because you are a doctor, and because they do not have your knowledge or your skills. You are two-thirds a person—they are half.
6192355000895876 You sure do love arithmetic.
6192355000895877 They're not dolls. They're people just like me.
6192355000895878 An emergency at the Factory, I guess… And now there's some sort of poisonous soot in the air. That's what people say.
6192355000895879 We'll see… what soot it is.
6192355000895880 I don't think so. I'm afraid it's worse.
6192355000895881 But isn't… Isn't this what happened in the Crude Sprawl five years ago? They cordoned off the district back then, too!
6192355000895882 I don't know. I wasn't in town then.
6192355000895883 Possibly. So it would be wiser of you to leave.
6192355000895886 Who are you?
6192355000895887 I'm an orderly. We wear these costumes on Bachelor Dankovsky's orders. They're easy to notice from afar and protect from infected particles… Maybe. Sometimes. A bit.\nI'd rather not check personally, unless they order me to delve in.
6192355000895888 Got it. Go on.
6192355000895889 If you're common medical personnel, how do you know anything about this disease? No one even knows what it is.
6192355000895890 I had a nap by Mistress Katerina's window. Saw a prophetic dream. Satisfied?
6192355000895891 Sure. The abilities of Mistresses are no laughing matter.
6192355000895892 Well, if there's no better explanation.
6192355000895893 Immunity is your armor. It gets thinner each time you contract the disease. So it would do you good to keep an eye on it. Take pills… You know the drill.
6192355000895894 But it's not healthy to take too many pills.
6192355000895895 I have my own immunity boosters, handcrafted.
6192355000895896 Infected air lowers your immunity. Slowly, but constantly, simply because you're breathing it in. But that's not the worst part.
6192355000895897 What is?
6192355000895898 An infected person's touch, or touching infected surfaces, like doorknobs or drawers.\nAlso… Sometimes it feels like the pest… breathes on you.
6192355000895899 Breathes? How?
6192355000895900 I'm not a doctor, Master Burakh. I'm a common orderly, scared witless. I'm only describing a dream I had.\nBut this pest… it's like it's alive. It speaks. Breathes. And woe, if it breathes on you.
6192355000895901 I'll keep it in mind.
6192355000895902 Why is it always about prophetic dreams in this town!
6192355000895903 Anyway. All <i>those</i> touches melt your immunity worse than air; like a hot knife through butter.\nThen there's a… tumor.
6192355000895904 A tumor? Like a cancerous growth?
6192355000896655 One can drink from barrels and water pumps—instead of the polluted Gorkhon.
6192355000896665 Who's that over there? Limp along, hobo. This house is ours. Get your loot elsewhere. Lotta free houses still standin'.
6192355000896666 This is my house.
6192355000896667 No, it ain't. It's ours. Objections?
6192355000896668 Yes, I object.
6192355000896669 Are there many of you?
6192355000898551 Hey, noukherne! Be khara, you are a good man. Buy my bull.
6192355000898552 Bayarlaa, noukherne. How much do you want for it?
6192355000898751 Father's house is being robbed!
6192355000898752 
6192355000898753 
6192355000898754 From now on, a public Fund will reward doctors for medical work. There's even talk of an advance payment.
6192355000899459 Would you look at that…
6192355000899460 What's going on there?
6192355000899751 …So that's the nightmare I had. Can you imagine? Just before I woke up, I told him, "Be on your way then, khayaala! People don't kill people."\nWhat do you want, old man?
6192355000899752 …What are you doing here?
6192355000900151 Where do you think you're going? Can't you see it's locked?
6192355000900152 What's going on here?
6192355000900153 Why?
6192355000900154 None of our business. And none of yours. The orders are not to let anyone in.
6192355000900155 Watch your tongue, tough guy.
6192355000900251 I've barely any cover left, see? That means I am almost one with the Earth now. I speak to you in her name. Be khara, you've forgotten everything, yargachin.
6192355000900252 Why are you standing here, basaghan?
6192355000900253 Are you harassing this woman, scum?
6192355000900254 And who are you?
6192355000900255 God forbid. We treated her with utmost respect.\nWhy call us "scum"? We ain't no crazed mob, we're on duty here. See the leather cap? We belong to the House.
6192355000900256 What house?
6192355000900257 "On duty"? But we never had any kinds of patrolmen here.
6192355000900258 We are the Saburovs' people. \nEach of the three houses assigned someone to look for the monster. The Olgimskys. The Kains, of course. And, obviously, the Saburovs. The latter being us.\nAnd who might you be, good sir?
6192355000900259 What monster?
6192355000900261 I'm Isidor Burakh's son. I've returned home after six years.
6192355000900262 Oh… Send my regards to your father. A most respectable man! He dragged my daughter from beyond the grave. And we almost gave up on her!\nYou tell him that. Tell him that Peter the Nightjar sends his fondest regards.
6192355000900263 I will.
6192355000900264 I'm not the person you're looking for.
6192355000900265 Will you stop hovering over the girl? You won't comfort her, you're only making it worse! Just go.
6192355000900266 A shabnak… A creature of steppe legends. They say Earth disgorges it. And then it steals a woman's form and goes around murdering folks.\nIt's all silly, of course. But we have an order to check… So we do.
6192355000900267 Who ordered this?
6192355000900268 Does anyone actually believe these old wives' tales?
6192355000900269 Oh, so you're an outsider, then? You see all kinds of things around here. The Earth here is special… It breathes.
6192355000900270 All right. And who are you?
6192355000900271 A steppe creature, a golem, a clay wench. It steals a woman's shape. But its legs remain clay or bone, so that's how you can tell.
6192355000900272 Bone or clay, right. I remember the tale.
6192355000900275 Good hunting, folks. At least you're not having to look for ghosts, or domovye. For now.
6192355000900284 For them. For us, today is Meat Day.
6192355000900285 Be khara. I see that.
6192355000900286 Just today? No, I know this town. Every day celebrates meat.
6192355000900287 Khayaala? I think it's a fasting period now… Good folks don't eat meat, not until winter.
6192355000900290 It's cured, kholboön. Who would keep fresh meat in a warehouse?\nAnd if you need to drink, the water is next to the Factory wall, see? Barrel water is the best, brought from the steppe. But in a pinch, you can drink this, too.
6192355000900291 All right. Show me the meat.
6192355000900292 So there's a water pump there now? All right, I'll use it. 
6192355000900298 But it's good.
6192355000900299 It's stolen.
6192355000900301 I'm listening.
6192355000900302 That's where the bodies are taken.
6192355000900303 What bodies?
6192355000900304 Of today's victims. Accidental victims…
6192355000900305 What do you mean?
6192355000900306 The autumn is foul this year. People have gone mad. That's what I mean.
6192355000900307 I don't understand…
6192355000900308 I feel like I've seen you before…
6192355000900309 What do you mean? We've never seen a dead person before. Have you?
6192355000900310 Yes.
6192355000900311 Be on your way then, khayaala. Why poke your nose around?
6192355000900312 Fair enough.
6192355000900313 Yes. I'm a doctor.
6192355000900314 You be on your way, mutts.
6192355000901451 Nightjar
6192355000901751 Got it.
6192355000901752 I see.

6192355000904451 The Tower, my precious Tower… The locals call her "the Polyhedron", referring to her as "it," as if she were inanimate. But for me, she is alive and female, and I can't abandon her. \nI have to gaze upon her again and again… to convince myself she exists.
6192355000904452 So it was you who thought up that thing? Peter Stamatin…
6192355000904453 You stink of booze, and your hands are shaking. You drink a lot, don't you?
6192355000904454 The Judge? What does he want with me? I will never build another one… No one ever will.
6192355000904455 What are you talking about?
6192355000904456 A lot. I have to quit drinking, but I don't have any willpower left.
6192355000904457 Why?
6192355000904458 There must be a reason, don't you think? But you're a doctor, not a priest. My memory is faulty, true, but I don't remember us being friends. \nTell me, what do you want? I'm not looking for company.
6192355000904459 As you wish.
6192355000904460 I am considered responsible for her creation… but I'm not God to completely defy gravity. It's… happenstance. Such a tower shouldn't be. It breaks the laws of physics. Laws of optics as well. Just a coincidence.
6192355000904461 Such things are never coincidences.
6192355000904462 Listen, what's your name?
6192355000904463 Artemy Burakh.
6192355000904464 How does it stand?
6192355000904465 So, it was you who designed that… thing on the opposite bank?
6192355000904466 That's what I'm pondering right now: How does she stand, indeed? Like a rose on its stem…
6192355000904467 This is an interesting chat, architect. We should talk more later.
6192355000904468 Whatever. This is not why I am here.
6192355000904469 Usually people call me "Help, I'm dying!"
6192355000904471 Doesn't matter.
6192355000904472 Why have you come?
6192355000904473 Prophylaxis. You're in a plagued district.
6192355000904474 To give you something better than twyrine.
6192355000904475 Just wanted to meet you.
6192355000904476 Listen, doctor… You should check on Anna, too. She's a circus artist who lives nearby. She's mysophobic—I'm worried she might lose it completely, these days. She's an interesting one. Be a pity if she died or went nuts.
6192355000904477 A mysophobic circus artist? Now that's something.
6192355000904478 I'll check on her. It's my job.
6192355000904479 That girl? "Interesting" is an understatement. Her nerves sure could use treatment.
6192355000904480 What is it with you artists always being so difficult? First Peter, now you…
6192355000904481 Are your hands clean?
6192355000904482 They are.
6192355000904483 I'm not going to touch you! Stop yelling.
6192355000904484 You've touched the doorknob!
6192355000904485 So what?
6192355000904486 My hands are covered in blood, so quit fooling around, little lady.
6192355000904487 What? Blood? What do you mean, covered in blood? Just stay away…
6192355000904488 I'm joking.
6192355000904489 I'm speaking figuratively.
6192355000904490 I am wearing gloves.
6192355000904491 Microbes are transmitted with touch. They stay on the skin. Evil is transmitted with touch too, and it stays on the skin. <i>Fate</i> is transmitted with touch. \nAll this dirt changes you, killing you slowly… This is so repulsive!
6192355000904492 Calm down, please.
6192355000904493 I'm a doctor. Microbes run from me like the devil from a holy flame.
6192355000904494 Are you drunk, too?
6192355000904495 I don't want to even think about it! Everyone is prattling about that toxic soot from the Factory! It's out there, behind the windows, everywhere… \nAll this dirt and grime… It's a punishment, that's what it is! It's all about those damned children!
6192355000904496 You're a circus artist, all right.
6192355000904497 You'll have to trust me if you want to survive this.
6192355000904498 What?
6192355000904499 Look me in the eyes and listen to me. I'm going to give you medicine to protect you from microbes. Do you understand me?
6192355000904500 I'm a doctor, making my rounds. Do as I tell you. There is an epidemic in town.
6192355000904501 An epidemic… Oh God. An epidemic. What? Plague? All my fault, my punishment…
6192355000904502 Not the plague. Something far worse.
6192355000904503 What kind of crime could condemn an entire town along with you?
6192355000904504 You're too full of yourself.
6192355000904505 Are you a real medic? You really can help me? So I wouldn't… Just don't touch me!
6192355000904506 A real one. Trust me.
6192355000904507 I can't avoid touching you. Don't fret. Drink this.
6192355000904508 Just stay indoors. Your nerves won't survive a trip outside, circus girl.
6192355000904509 What a lout… Have you checked up on my brother yet?
6192355000904510 I have. I took care of him.
6192355000904511 I'm going there soon.
6192355000904513 Take good care of my brother, doctor. If I kick the bucket, so be it. But my brother must survive. He is a genius.
6192355000904514 And you're not?
6192355000904515 Sure am. Have you seen the Dancing Bridge in the Capital?
6192355000904516 Never been there.
6192355000904517 I don't like your attitude, architect.
6192355000904518 You built that?
6192355000904519 That's right. And the Polyhedron? What do you think?
6192355000904520 It looks like an abscess.

6192355000906754 I made tinctures of two different colors. Only one more to grasp.
6192355000907351 Odongh
6192355000907365 If you see a man, run. They're angry today. They kill the likes of you and I.
6192355000907366 You think we've got anything in common, odongh?
6192355000907367 Why are they so hateful?
6192355000907368 We aren't human. We're different.
6192355000907369 Well, you're a Worm. But I'm human.
6192355000907370 Unfortunately, I'm made of flesh and blood, so I'll take that advice.
6192355000907371 Seeking a murderer. Becoming murderers themselves. This is how a town changes.
6192355000907372 What murderer? What's that got to do with me?
6192355000907373 I'll be cautious.
6192355000907374 But the earth doesn't.
6192355000907375 You look like a murderer. Don't delve into the Town's flesh if you want to live. Keep to the outskirts. Fewer people here.
6192355000907376 Thanks, Worm. May Mother Boddho keep your footprints warm.
6192355000907377 I can't. My business is at the Town's heart.
6192355000907378 See that man there, up ahead? Neither of us could beat him on our own. I'm weak today.
6192355000907379 We could both attack him.
6192355000907380 I am too.
6192355000907381 I'll risk it.
6192355000907382 Yes. You and I are weak. He's strong. Neither of us would win alone. But together, maybe we can.
6192355000907383 Let's try.
6192355000907384 Forget it. I'll try to sneak by him. Maybe he won't see me.
6192355000907385 Don't even think about it. You're wounded. You're bad at fighting up-close. You'd probably die.
6192355000907386 You think?
6192355000907387 So be it.
6192355000909351 When it comes crashing down, it will bombard the Stone Yard with debris.
6192355000909352 It's one of yours too, I gather. How did you even come up with something like that?
6192355000909355 Don't fret, it's not going to collapse any time soon. It's held for five years, and will survive at least five hundred more.
6192355000909356 How does the ground even support something so large?
6192355000909357 One must be able to think boldly. The ground is nothing but dirt. Nothing but soil hiding rotting corpses. It's the realm of the dead. \nWe've always wanted to create something that the earth cannot touch, cannot defile in any way.
6192355000909358 I've always considered Earth to be the source of life.
6192355000909359 I just don't understand you idealistic maniacs.
6192355000909360 You should stay inside. Just to be safe.
6192355000909361 I am the battering ram that clears his path. Me and him are perfect twins.
6192355000909362 All in all, you seem healthy. The judge will be pleased.
6192355000909363 The local climate is good for twins.
6192355000909364 Why would I want a bull?
6192355000909365 It's as good as free. Three hundred.
6192355000909366 Cheap indeed. Is it stolen?
6192355000909367 It's not just any bull. It brings luck. When the time comes, it'll tell you what to do.
6192355000909368 Can it talk then?
6192355000909369 You offend me, Khatangher. Not stolen; it's just that money is needed more than bulls these days.
6192355000909370 How come?
6192355000909371 Forget bulls! Be khara, you could sell air.
6192355000909372 Unente, it is known: it will talk on the scariest day of your life, showing you the right way.\nEh, kharaldaa, I'd rather not have it at all. Perhaps there won't be a scary day in my life, then.
6192355000909373 That's funny logic, like you believe your own tall tale. The scary day will come if you have a bull or not. It's not his life, but yours.
6192355000909374 To be honest, I think you're just a swindler, noukherne.
6192355000909375 Take him for two hundred. It's a good bull. Be khara, it'll be useful to you.
6192355000909377 You're out of your mind, Khatangher. Find yourself another fool.
6192355000909379 So you're selling a curse on four legs? Great. I'll take if from you if <i>you</i> pay <i>me.</i>
6192355000909380 I don't even have a place to keep it.
6192355000909382 I don't have that much.
6192355000909383 Pay me now, and I'll bring it to your place later. There'll come a day when you'll be grateful to me!
6192355000909384 You mean the scariest day of my life? Nah, not interested.
6192355000909385 That was funny, khayaala. Go sell your bull to Big Vlad. He has a lot of money.
6192355000909386 Fine. Here's the money. We'll see if you keep your word.
6192355000912951 Bountiful harvest?
6192355000912952 Huh?
6192355000912953 Brown twyre costs three times as much today.
6192355000912954 I see.
6192355000912957 Oh… I thought you were an herbalist, here to sell herbs.
6192355000912958 Do you buy twyre?
6192355000912959 We've only got two weeks until September ends. We're now in the golden time of harvest. We need to stock up for the whole year ahead…
6192355000912960 How much do you pay?
6192355000912961 Ashen swish is more expensive today.
6192355000912962 Swish is a sinister herb. Its steppe name is Bardo Suok, "the darkness of the depths." But no matter…
6192355000913588 Odongh
6192355000913589 If you see a man, run. Men are angry today. They kill the likes of you and I.
6192355000913590 You think we have anything in common, odongh?
6192355000913591 Why are they so hateful?
6192355000913592 We're not human. We're different.
6192355000913593 You're a worm, true. But I am human all right.
6192355000913594 Unfortunately, I am made of flesh and blood. So I'll take your advice.
6192355000913595 Looking for a murderer. Turning into murderers themselves. This is how a town changes.
6192355000913596 What murderer? What does it have to do with me?
6192355000913597 I'll be cautious.
6192355000913598 But the earth doesn't.
6192355000913599 You look like a murderer. Do not delve into the town's flesh in you want to live. Keep to the outskirts. Less people here.
6192355000913600 Thanks, Worm. Let Mother Boddho keep your footprints warm.
6192355000913601 I can't. I have business at the heart of the town.
6192355000913951 It was an accident, I swear… She was trying to get out, not fall down. She held so tight...
6192355000913952 Out? Why not use the gate then?
6192355000913953 The Termitary got locked in, didn't you know? Olgimsky's orders. Rumor has it, the workers were on a strike.
6192355000913954 A strike? Finally.
6192355000913957 Are you Burakh? Your father's house is being robbed. Right now.
6192355000913958 By whom?
6192355000913959 Hey, kharaldaa... I didn't do anything.
6192355000913960 Be khara, you can protect yourself.
6192355000913961 You shouldn't look either.
6192355000913962 What do you have here?
6192355000917751 How do you know?
6192355000917752 How should I know? I only looked from the outside. Even then, I barely got out of there alive. Got cut with a razor, see? And it could have been even worse.
6192355000917753 Who did this to you?
6192355000917754 People have turned to looting—didn't you know? Houses are being burgled all over the Hindquarters, in the Tanners, in the Skinners. The plague has abandoned those districts. \nEmpty houses, open for thieves. So people barge in—and no one punishes them, no one even frowns! Guess we all have too many other concerns these days…
6192355000917755 What about our new patrolmen? Aren't they doing… something?
6192355000917756 Seen it myself.
6192355000917757 Are there many of them?
6192355000917758 They guard infected districts. Saburov said that's more important than looting. So, are you going?
6192355000917759 I see. I am.
6192355000917760 Will you come with me?
6192355000917761 No. I respect you, but I won't ever return there. That place is beyond the law now.
6192355000917762 Fine. Thanks for the warning.
6192355000917763 Got any weapons? Without 'em that place is… inhospitable.
6192355000917764 I'll be fine.
6192355000917765 I don't need weapons to deal with bandits.
6192355000917766 Let me see.
6192355000917767 Relax, I'll live. You hurry home!
6192355000917768 What is even the point of robbing it…
6192355000917769 The plague has left there? Impossible…
6192355000917770 And yet it's true. The air is clear. There's no infection there.
6192355000917771 Huh…
6192355000917773 Why did they run away?
6192355000917774 I don't know. They behaved so strange…
6192355000917775 What are you doing here, basaghan?
6192355000917776 I brought my bones here.
6192355000917777 Why?
6192355000917778 Are you… kissing the skull?
6192355000917779 I'm not kissing it. It was in my hands, then people ran in. I was embarrassed and hid my face.
6192355000917780 But you haven't done anything wrong. Why were you ashamed?
6192355000917785 I won't explain to you. I did nothing wrong. I just brought my bones here. What's wrong with that? These bones are mine, I didn't steal them! I tell the truth.
6192355000917786 Well, sure… Nothing wrong about any of this.
6192355000917787 You should be more careful with your bones, basaghan. You're acting strange. And people rarely appreciate that.
6192355000917788 What's so strange about that? They're the strange ones.
6192355000917789 Well… People don't usually toy around with bull skulls.
6192355000917790 Come to think of it, it isn't. So go ahead and do whatever you want, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.
6192355000917791 It will not.
6192355000917792 I believe you, basaghan.
6192355000917793 But I still think you should leave. They might return.
6192355000917810 Your brother disagrees.
6192355000917811 Ah… You spoke to him, didn't you? How is he? Why even ask, though… My brother is a tough man. He can overcome any hardship.
6192355000917812 Your brother is alive and well.
6192355000917813 He is… a keen one.
6192355000917814 All of us could use some treatment in that regard. Can you do that?
6192355000917815 I can. I can do everything.
6192355000917816 I specialize in another field.
6192355000917817 Maybe.
6192355000917818 Great job. Have a drink on me, then.
6192355000917819 You know I'm not some handyman you have to bribe with booze?
6192355000917820 Keep it. The alcohol should keep the microbes at bay.
6192355000917821 Give me the bottle, and keep your compliments.
6192355000917824 I've already visited Peter.
6192355000917825 I've spoken to Andrey just recently. He is safe.
6192355000917826 I need both alive and well. Those two are a single creature. Each one of them is stunted without the other.
6192355000917827 Very well.
6192355000917828 You needn't worry, Judge. The brothers are safe.
6192355000917829 You're a good doctor, Burakh. You've returned home at an evil hour, but still in time.
6192355000917830 I should have returned earlier. That way we'd still have the best doctor we could hope for.
6192355000917831 Thank you for your kind words, Judge. Only time will tell how good a doctor I really am.
6192355000917833 Why? Is there a fire or something?
6192355000917834 Still… Why not use the window on a lower floor?
6192355000917835 People are like sunflower seeds to Big Vlad. He extracts their lifeblood like oil. They've had enough, they've had it with working both day <i>and</i> night shifts so often.\nSo he locked them in, to keep it contained… to protect the Town. Or we'd have a riot…
6192355000917836 A third of the Town works for the Bull Enterprise. Are they <i>all</i> inside?
6192355000917837 Like beasts in a cage.
6192355000917838 It doesn't bode well.
6192355000917839 That's 'cause the workers are on the edge! They're steppe people, not animals! They also have feelings, they too want to live… but it gets worse for them by the year.
6192355000917840 Worse?
6192355000917841 A strike seems… uncharacteristic for them.
6192355000917842 Huh.
6192355000923751 
6192355000923752 
6192355000923759 Why are you leaving? Aren't they waiting for you in the Town?
6192355000923760 They are.
6192355000923761 Who are you?
6192355000923762 I'm curious what's out there.
6192355000923763 Go back to the Town, Artemy Burakh. The steppe will call for you. Maybe even tomorrow. But now you're needed home. You've nothing to do here yet.
6192355000923764 Don't tell me what to do. It's up to me.
6192355000923765 You're right… I'll return here later.
6192355000923766 All I want is some quiet and emptiness.
6192355000923767 A reflection.
6192355000923768 What do you want, reflection?
6192355000923769 Do you think the steppe's changed over the six years that you haven't been here? This earth is alive still; even a thousand years is but a moment to her.
6192355000923770 Happy to hear that.
6192355000923771 Who knows…
6192355000925651 Doctor Burakh, right? Here's your allowance for today.
6192355000925652 What allowance?
6192355000925653 I expected more.
6192355000925654 Yesterday the rulers have established the Fund for Outbreak Control. Until the centralized workings of the Town's institutions can be restored, every acting doctor will receive a daily allowance. The size of this allowance depends on the end results of your deeds. \nToday's portion is your advance.
6192355000925655 What kind of deeds are we talking about here?
6192355000925656 What a great opportunity to evaluate my skills.
6192355000925657 Who exactly will be judging my results?
6192355000925658 First off, you have to attend the hospital every day. It is housed in the building of the Theatre.
6192355000925659 I know.
6192355000925660 A nice touch.
6192355000925662 I am just the messenger here. Such are the rules the rulers have decided upon.\nThe money you receive is a budget for buying medicine and other supplies you'll need for working with the infection. This system should last us until a centralized distribution system gets arranged.
6192355000925663 So what is expected of me?
6192355000925664 Hospital attendance is mandatory and should be your highest priority. If you fail to complete your daily assignment, the Fund will deny you any payment for that day, including rewards for other activities.
6192355000925665 Activities such as…?
6192355000925666 Mother of god… This is one of Dankovsky's bright ideas, isn't it?
6192355000925667 Helping the infected in the streets. \nThe ones stumbling around are beyond salvation, but if you see someone lying on the ground and shuddering, consider giving them a pill. Even a wrong antibiotic helps somewhat.
6192355000925670 I have no instructions on this matter.
6192355000925671 One less problem for me to worry about.
6192355000925672 I wasn't present at yesterday's council. As far as I know, Doctor Dankovsky and you are subsidized from the Fund exactly the same.
6192355000925673 That's nice to know. What other activities get rewarded?
6192355000925674 Are you sure it will get arranged?
6192355000925675 It's hard to say. The Town is experiencing an economic crisis. On top of the plague, the supply train is late. And we can't simply seize the items we need from shops at the moment.
6192355000925676 Got it. What's my job in all this?
6192355000925677 Last but not least. The heads of the families—the Kains in particular—understand that the situation might require you to go beyond the norms of the law.\nBe warned, however: Your good name across town will also be taken into account when calculating your daily allowance.
6192355000925678 It couldn't be easy, could it?
6192355000925679 All right. Where do I sign?
6192355000925680 Take the money, it's in the cabinet. The final score is tallied at midnight, so the subsidy for yesterday will wait for you from midnight on. The Fund works round the clock, so don't be shy.
6192355000925681 Good for you.
6192355000925682 All right, register man. Anything else?
6192355000925683 That must be why you sound like a talking cash register…
6192355000925684 Got it. You produce twyrine here, then?
6192355000925687 It's different every day. Depends on what we're currently brewing. Some herbs may cost triple sometimes.
6192355000925688 I see.
6192355000925689 We're not just interested in twyre. Ashen swish, swevery, and white whip are all, of course, more rare… So, more expensive.
6192355000925690 You value time, huh?
6192355000925692 I'll keep it in mind.
6192355000925693 Are herbs plentiful this year?
6192355000925694 Quite. The Brides must have done a great job.
6192355000925695 And just in time, too…
6192355000925696 You mean dancing?
6192355000925697 Sometimes, when I go out into the steppe, I see dozens of them stepping around, swaying. Beautiful…
6192355000925698 Beautiful, indeed.
6192355000925699 I don't like them. They've got a creepy vibe.
6192355000925700 Be careful with it. It only takes one swish to see someone's head roll.
6192355000925701 Swevery costs more today.
6192355000925702 What do you even make from it? It's as bitter as bile.
6192355000925703 I'd give even more for it.
6192355000925704 Today, people want white whip. We'll pay extra.
6192355000925705 Do you even know where it grows?
6192355000925706 You people are odd…
6192355000925707 Blood twyre costs three times as much today.
6192355000925708 Lucky me.
6192355000925709 Blood twyre produces bad twyrine. Makes a person forget themselves.
6192355000925710 Today, the special offer is black twyre.
6192355000925711 My favorite.
6192355000925712 All right…
6192355000928151 So you're Isidor's son, huh?
6192355000928155 
6192355000928156 
6192355000928157 I am.
6192355000928160 Isidor could make special potions. Cures for any diseases.
6192355000928161 Except dirty conscience.
6192355000928179 Most importantly, I'll never ask you where you got the human organs needed to make these potions. But they make brilliant antibiotics. Today, we buy them at a special price.
6192355000928180 You're a sly guy.
6192355000928183 Do you have any of his stock left?
6192355000928184 Yes.
6192355000932551 I can craft them myself.
6192355000932552 I'd pay good money for them.
6192355000932553 Lucky me.
6192355000932554 Just keep me in mind.
6192355000932555 I'll find a better use for them.
6192355000932556 Money is worthless now.
6192355000932557 None of them was a panacea.
6192355000932558 I will.
6192355000932559 Today we need potions that reduce pain.
6192355000932560 I see.
6192355000932561 Pain is crucial for self-improvement.
6192355000932562 Did you know my father?
6192355000932563 Everyone did. He was a real man.
6192355000932564 He was.
6192355000932565 Fine. I see you're not the talkative type.
6192355000932651 
6192355000934551 I saw you several times before. When you were a child, my brother Simon was close to your father. One could say they were friends.
6192355000934552 So, I gather you already know why I'm here?
6192355000934553 I am.
6192355000934554 Greetings, Judge.
6192355000934555 About the house. Now, after I've seen you with my own eyes, I relinquish all claims I have on your property. The house is yours.
6192355000934556 That's all it took…?
6192355000934557 I'm going to write a decree. Pass it to the prefect of the Hindquarters district. Today, of course.
6192355000934558 Thank you, Judge.
6192355000934559 Why did you want our house in the first place?
6192355000934560 We Kains are a family of builders. We built this town. Every house adds something unique to it's image. We… let's say we keep track of this process.
6192355000934561 What did you have in store for my home?
6192355000934562 Children! Artemy fell asleep. Though he has disgraced this class, we must continue.\nToday, I'll teach you the right way to eat a person. For a woman, start with the softest flesh. For a man, the internal organs. And please, stay away from anyone with red hair. Their flesh is venomous.
6192355000934563 …Lara?
6192355000934564 Children! Life's rules are simple. \nEveryone for themselves. Everyone's shirt is closer to their skin. It's neither your headache nor your piece of cake. Homō hominī lupus est. You have neither mothers nor fathers. Murder unseen. Repeat after me.
6192355000934565 Stop!
6192355000934566 You've fallen asleep! This is the most important lesson of your life, and you've fallen asleep! The most crucial lesson!\nChildren! What do we say to Artemy? How will we punish him? Will he stand in the corner, like Daniil?
6192355000934567 I wasn't asleep.
6192355000934568 Gravel? What's wrong with you?
6192355000934569 Let's skip straight to the cane…
6192355000934572 Life's rules are simple… Oh, I forgot how it went.
6192355000934573 I've got a question.
6192355000934574 Ask questions with your hand raised! If you have any hands left, I mean.
6192355000934575 Why is Daniil being punished?
6192355000934576 I will be good, I promise…
6192355000934577 This is all a joke, Lara… Isn't it?
6192355000934578 Daniil was punished for insolence. Children! Which of you can tell us why Daniil deserves punishment? Children! Tell us, what awaits him?
6192355000934579 Poverty.
6192355000934580 Glory, I guess…
6192355000934581 Oblivion?
6192355000934582 Children! To survive, to remain resolute, you must heed this lesson. Remember: History is written by winners. There is no truth. The truth is whatever you think it is.
6192355000934583 Pinch me, someone…
6192355000934584 That's true, but…
6192355000934585 If you have a friend, learn to betray them. If you have a lover, disappoint them first, then betray them and leave them behind.\nChildren! I'm teaching you how to survive. What was your homework?
6192355000934586 I did my homework, I swear!
6192355000934587 I'm going to give you a sleeping pill. You need to sleep, Gravel.
6192355000934588 Divination. Lara, you are about to kill a person. You'll be executed for it.
6192355000934589 Hey, can I copy your homework?
6192355000934590 No, you can't. You were rude to me.
6192355000934591 What was the task?
6192355000934592 The rules of life, as always.
6192355000934593 Don't you know it all in advance?
6192355000934594 Don't worry. She won't check yours today.
6192355000934595 Want a gingerbread?
6192355000934596 Sure.
6192355000934597 No.
6192355000934598 Shall we meet after the class?
6192355000934599 Why are you so grown up, anyway? How'd they let you into the school?
6192355000934600 I don't know…
6192355000934601 Why was Daniil punished?
6192355000934602 He told her she doesn't know how to play and only ruins it all.
6192355000934603 Wow… Bold of him.
6192355000934604 Well, it's true.
6192355000937051 Sentry
6192355000937851 It wasn't us. She was already burning when we came here… We tried to save her, but failed.
6192355000937852 It wasn't you? Then who?
6192355000937853 Oh yes, I saw your valiant attempts…
6192355000937854 No. It was a twyre-addled mob. The steppe is in bloom, and people get crazed… But never before was it <i>this</i> bad.
6192355000937855 But what for?
6192355000937856 Why a steppe girl?
6192355000937857 Old wives' tales… They claim a golem sometimes emerges from the ground. It looks like a woman, but is all earth, clay, rock, and marrow. The story claims it has legs of bone and this… uncanny way of walking.\nAnd the brides… You know they have a special walk, too.
6192355000937858 Not a walk. A dance.
6192355000937859 Do people seriously still believe this?
6192355000937861 Us? It wasn't us who did this… unspeakable thing. We'd like to find the scum who did and lay them down next to the poor girl.
6192355000937862 How long have people been this… crazed?
6192355000937863 You will. Our town is a small one.
6192355000937864 What bones? Can't you plainly see that it's a normal girl?
6192355000937865 How will you live with this, now?
6192355000937866 Don't you know how it goes? "Get her!" one screams, and the rest crowd without hesitation… Especially in the night, especially with their minds intoxicated.\nNot everyone can think for themselves. It's easier to just do as you're told.
6192355000937867 Do people scream things like that often around here?
6192355000937868 Shrewd.
6192355000937869 Have you been listening, lad? I'm telling you, this is the first time! The world must be coming to an end…
6192355000937870 Indeed.
6192355000937871 I can't believe my eyes.
6192355000937872 Tell the governor I have a witness! They will confirm I'm innocent in my father's death.
6192355000937873 What kind of witness?
6192355000937874 A girl named Murky.
6192355000937875 A strange kid named Lika. He wears a dog head.
6192355000937876 Who would trust a kid? They'd say anything for a peanut. And if you have witnesses, why were they silent before?
6192355000937877 They weren't given time.
6192355000937878 A child isn't a person?
6192355000943162 That's all right, I'll live. Although, you know... workers sometimes carry bandages and tourniquets around. Lots of injuries at the cannery. Talk to people, perhaps you can trade for some.
6192355000943163 Do lie down. I'll get something for you and come back.
6192355000943164 So you're back, huh?
6192355000943165 Wait some more.
6192355000943166 Here, let me fix that elbow. Hold still...
6192355000943167 Thanks. That's useful to know.
6192355000943168 Nothing for now. I'll come back if I get a bandage.
6192355000943192 Prices will rise two times tomorrow. Four times, a day after that. And Suok knows what will happen two days after tomorrow. I need to stock up today.
6192355000943193 Oh my. How do you know this?
6192355000943194 Don't laugh, but… my bull told me.
6192355000943195 You <i>are</i> a funny man, noukherne!
6192355000943196 Huh?
6192355000943197 Bayarlaa to you for this news, Khatangher. I won't buy your bull; I'd rather spend my money on other things today.
6192355000943957 We line our boats with fingernails to make their path smoother. You have become burdensome, menkhu. Too much death, too much trouble in your chest. Too heavy for a boat to carry.\nWe'll need two fingernails.
6192355000943958 I'm in no position to argue.
6192355000943959 One was enough to carry my burdens before.
6192355000943960 You line their boats with them? But they are just coins, made of metal…
6192355000943961 You didn't carry a whole town on your back before.
6192355000943962 …Have your fingernails.
6192355000943964 I don't have two.
6192355000943972 We believe you didn't kill our patriarch. We'll transport you along the Gullet and the Guzzle, the tributaries of the Gorkhon, our kind river.\nBut it will still cost you fingernails. There's no other way.
6192355000943973 What about toenails?
6192355000943974 Why?
6192355000943975 …Why do you believe me?
6192355000943976 We've heard this joke too many times. It was never funny.
6192355000943977 Sure. Sorry.
6192355000943978 The Gorkhon is a kind river, but its water isn't for humans. You can't drink from the Gorkhon. You ought not walk into it, either.\nWe traverse its edge. It's frightening. We need fingernails, so that we can always return.
6192355000943979 I see.
6192355000943980 Fair enough. I'll keep an eye out for you when I have fingernails and want to travel around faster.
6192355000943981 Because we are ferrymen. We know from which way you came and when.\nThe murders happened at night. You arrived in the morning. We sensed that a new person appeared in the Town. We keep track of that.
6192355000943982 Yeah, well, tell that to the townsfolk.
6192355000943983 Yeah, I remember your sense… thing. Something to do with weight?
6192355000943984 How many of us live here, by the way?
6192355000943985 No one would believe us. We are ferrymen.
6192355000943986 So what?
6192355000943987 Yeah… I forgot.
6192355000943988 Yes. In a way.\nWhen you disengage from the Earth and glide over water, you begin to feel the weight of humanity that Mother Boddho carries on her back.
6192355000943989 People are scared of water.
6192355000943990 I can't tell. The unheard of now happens: People kill other people. So the weight shifts, and shifts, and shifts.\n…One more has just died. No… Two more.
6192355000943991 How do you do this?
6192355000943992 A bad day for our town…
6192355000945551 Put away your fingernails, Burakh the menkhu. Death stands behind your back. We will not carry it on our boats.
6192355000945552 What do you mean, you won't? I'm about to suffocate here…
6192355000945553 Our boats will not leave infected districts. We can carry you into the plague, but not out of it. The air is heavy here. It drives the boat down. If we pull off, we'll sink.
6192355000945554 Am I supposed to go back into that hell now?
6192355000946551 Father is dead. There's a crowd of gawkers by our house. They might know what happened.
6192355000948774 From you? Oh, nothing. I was just sharing.\nFrom the local authorities, though, I want a lot. I want them to make sure that the burial business is supervised by someone a bit older than fifteen, and far more rational! I'll make sure it happens!
6192355000948775 Wait, emshen. Don't bother the girl. Perhaps I can talk sense into her.
6192355000950151 
6192355000950157 Bowman
6192355000951151 
6192355000951152 
6192355000951153 Played vigilantes. Attacked people. I've no idea what got into them, losing any semblance of humanity…\nWho screamed murder in the morning? Who rumor-mongered about the clay golem shaped like a woman? Who started murdering people with no due process?
6192355000951154 I don't know.
6192355000951155 Not me. And I'm not sure what you're talking about.
6192355000951156 Absurdity… How could it happen? How could anyone call themselves human after that?\nGod. Go. Calm down and be on your way.
6192355000951157 I have nothing to do with any of this.
6192355000951158 You're a tough one. You should be a foreman at the Abattoir.
6192355000951159 Something happened this night. I'm not sure what exactly, myself.\nThen a rumor spread: a steppe golem had stolen a woman's shape and started to kill. Stone Age idiocy! They beat several steppe girls to death. I wonder if twyre drives folks insane…
6192355000951160 Were these the ones who beat girls to death?
6192355000951161 They tried. That's all right though; they'll be taken to the Town Hall and dealt with now.
6192355000951162 Wow…
6192355000951163 I was also attacked today. Even though I can hardly be confused for a girl.
6192355000951164 Everyone calm down, now! No more mob justice!\nWhat the fuck do you want? Everything is dealt with over here. No more blood!
6192355000951165 What is dealt with?
6192355000951166 The murderers. It wasn't them. And if it was, it's up for the Judge to decide.\nAre you one of the crazies who can't keep their fists in check?
6192355000951167 Calm down. What did they do?
6192355000951168 I'm Artemy Burakh, Isidor's son. I only arrived today.
6192355000951169 Nope. He's not home. The man's at work in the Town Hall, they say. He's signing orders to catch all the grim-inals.
6192355000951170 Who's not home?
6192355000951171 Grim-what?
6192355000951172 Saburov, the governor. You're here to see him, aren't you?
6192355000951173 Yeah.
6192355000951174 Why won't you go to the Town Hall yourself then?
6192355000951175 I mean, the marauders, the ones who started the hunt in the morning. Did you sleep through it all?
6192355000951176 And who are you waiting for here?
6192355000951177 It's all crowded now… and mine is a quiet business. I'd rather wait here. He won't listen to me there, but here—anything can happen. He's a good man, overall.
6192355000951178 And what exactly do you want from him? Perhaps I can help?
6192355000951179 He used to be decent, yes… If not a lover of drastic measures.
6192355000951180 Nah… You can't. My old man was seized when they discovered there was a shortage at the Warehouse. Only he wasn't to blame, it's Filin's thieves' doing.\nSaburov's an honest man. He'll set it all straight. Only, it might take them a <i>long</i> time to figure out and release my old man. Afraid his case might slip through the cracks…
6192355000951181 You're a good kid.
6192355000951182 It's nice to know he's honest.
6192355000954451 Daniil's mumbling from his corner… I think he just said those are Berkeley's ideas.
6192355000954452 Cub, I'm in trouble. Have you heard about the water?
6192355000954453 No.
6192355000954454 Thank you. Many people have already used the barrel. I told them it was all thanks to you.
6192355000954455 Lara! This water shouldn't be drank!
6192355000954458 Well… I can guess. I've been around the Town, after all.
6192355000954460 We're running out of water. They won't carry in more from the steppe springs because of the quarantine.\nAnd, last night, someone sabotaged the water pumps. The remaining barrels are all we have. Do you understand?
6192355000954461 Sabotaged the water pumps? Why?
6192355000954462 Idiots. It's not cholera.
6192355000954463 Because the Abattoir dumps its waste into the Gorkhon. But the pumps take water from the Gullet and the Guzzle. They're more clear.\nBut today, a rumor spread that the pumps were producing muddy water, because someone allegedly dumped corpses into the tributaries.
6192355000954464 More nonsense. The cemetery isn't far, and it's spacious. We have plenty of room for the dead. For now, anyway.
6192355000954465 This… this is the real epidemic. It infects people's minds.
6192355000954467 Things are bad, Cub. God knows when the water bearers will return to the steppe. Those barrels are all we have, and they'll be guarded. Each person is only allowed one bottle.
6192355000954468 Well, it makes sense. Why would you need more?
6192355000954469 Listen. I want to provide a place for the healthy people who have lost their homes. A home for the living. My house is on the outskirts, so the plague wouldn't reach us here.\nBut this isn't feasible without drinking water.
6192355000954470 A stupid idea! If you invite random people, you're bound to get infected!
6192355000954471 A home for the living… You're still searching for a way to serve, aren't you? Lara, I don't think you have it in you.
6192355000954472 I've always respected you, Gravel. And my respect just grew.
6192355000954473 Father would approve.
6192355000954474 I suppose he would, yes.
6192355000954475 I just have a bad feeling about it.
6192355000954476 In the Middle Town, it's Olgimsky's people who will guard the water… Just tell them. They'll listen.\nPlease, sweet Cub, I beg of you! It's not selfish. It's for a good cause, those poor survivors… No one else cares for the homeless… Please?
6192355000954477 Well… I'll see what I can do, but I'm not sure.
6192355000954478 Oh, don't give me that martyred look! …Fine. I'll do it.
6192355000954479 It won't work, Lara.
6192355000954485 What? Why? The water's muddy, sure, but it's good. Everyone drank it, and no one got sick. I did, too, and look at me: I'm fine!
6192355000954486 What have I done…
6192355000954487 What have you done…
6192355000954488 What have we done…
6192355000954489 What's wrong? Don't let the paranoia get to you. You've done well.
6192355000954490 Let us hope for the best…
6192355000954491 Don't drink from that barrel again. It's not safe.
6192355000956351 
6192355000959451 Now, lend me your eyes and ears. We trust you, so we'll let you in on the Game.
6192355000959452 Whoa. Sounds important.
6192355000959459 Very much so. We've never ever allowed an adult into the Great Game. It's forbidden. You'll be the first.\n…Or rather the second. Believe me, we wouldn't invite you, if not for that first one.
6192355000959460 What first one?
6192355000959461 <i>The</i> one. The one everyone's after. The person who's… well… the Old Man… I mean, you father… I mean, you know.
6192355000959462 What? Are you kidding? Impossible!
6192355000959463 Whoa, you're a beast! Whose idea was it to let the muscle in on the Game? What's next, an invitation to Barley the Thug?
6192355000959464 I'm looking for the murderer, just like you are. As soon as I find them, I won't bother you anymore.
6192355000959465 Pfft. Yeah, right. No one leaves the Game just like that, not after they're invited. You'd rather crawl in a pillow and jump from a cup.
6192355000959466 Have you found anything strange?
6192355000959467 In the Gut, under the stairway. You won't miss it.\nAnd don't forget to leave something! We'll check, too! We'll see what kind of player you are. 'Cause we've had a bunch… Remember Firebrand, the cheapskate? He'd take a watch and leave a pencil… Some personality! At least we figured out it was him quick.
6192355000959468 Relax, relax. I remember the rules.
6192355000959469 So that's what he looks like. Behold, folks.\nSo here's what we want you to know: don't let yourself think we'd let you in on the Game just 'cause you're pretty. No one's happy that we had to do it. Got it? No one knows you yet. And if you spill the beans to any grown-up. you'll mess it all up. Got it?
6192355000959470 Have you found anything?
6192355000959471 Tread lighter, will you? Or you'll wake up the Mistresses. Victoria would be fine, but what if you disturbed Nina?
6192355000959472 I'm here about the caches…
6192355000959473 Yeah, we know. Sleepy Head told us you were in.\nHere's one cache. We found odd things inside. Play well, will you? Don't let us down.
6192355000959474 I'll do my very best.
6192355000959475 Go to the Gut. You'll find a cache there in the boulders, next to a threshing machine.\nJust be sneaky, all right? Don't let anyone see you. Got it?
6192355000959476 Will you calm down… You distrustful chipmunk.
6192355000959479 Look in the Gut, in the boulders, next to a threshing machine.
6192355000959480 See you.
6192355000959487 An inspection, eh? 'Tis all silliness, if you ask me. The water is all right. People drank it, and no one died.
6192355000959488 What inspection?
6192355000959489 So barrels have guards standing over them now?
6192355000959490 Your decision, doctor?
6192355000959491 This barrel is clear. Stand your guard. Water is more precious than gold now.
6192355000959492 You've gone all pale, doctor… Is everything okay? Is the water fine in this barrel?
6192355000959493 How would I know if it's dangerous? I guess it would be smart to take a sample to Dankovsky. He's the microscope man.
6192355000959496 You know what? Take this barrel to the outskirts, to Ravel's house. I'll examine it there.
6192355000959497 I'm not sure. This water is indeed strange. It has this odor… but that doesn't mean anything. Let me think.
6192355000962051 Boater
6192355000965851 Hah, what a face! A loser's face.
6192355000965852 Appearance isn't everything.
6192355000965853 Look who's talking.
6192355000971452 "And this pestilence was the more virulent for that, by communication with those who were sick thereof, it gat hold upon the sound, no otherwise than fire upon things dry or greasy, whenas they are brought very near thereunto. Nay, the mischief was yet greater…" And why was that, I wonder?
6192355000971453 Are you quoting something?
6192355000971454 …Something about touching. Can't remember the exact wording.
6192355000971456 By all means. He is a heavenly man. He won't take care of himself.
6192355000971457 
6192355000971458 Your brother, who is he?
6192355000971459 In a hundred years, the whole Town will be dead and forgotten, yet my brother's name will live in human memory. That's who he is.
6192355000971460 We'll be dead and forgotten way sooner than that.
6192355000971461 As if the point of living is being remembered after death…
6192355000977551 You are being hunted. You'll need a weapon.
6192355000977552 Yeah… I could use one.
6192355000977553 It just so happens that no one carries firearms around these parts. It's a peaceful town.
6192355000977554 Peaceful, my ass…
6192355000977562 That's for the best.
6192355000977564 Pushing me in the direction of bloodshed, huh?
6192355000977565 Like you needed pushing…\nListen, we respected Old Burakh. You are the only person who can replace him. We don't want to see you dead, too.
6192355000977566 Thanks.
6192355000977567 So what do you suggest?
6192355000977576 And it just so happens that I have a revolver. But I can't give it away for free. For a reasonable price, though…
6192355000977577 Where did you get it?
6192355000977578 Why can't you just give it to me?
6192355000977579 I work in pickling. The Factory stopped working today. We fear it may be the first sign of serious trouble: Big Vlad is no charity. He cares little for his workers.\nIf I lose my job, our family is about to have a very rough time. Surely you understand.
6192355000977580 I do. How much?
6192355000977581 Our storekeeper has his way of finding… curios. He orders them from the big world, to be delivered by train, on Big Vlad's behalf.\nThat's all right. The Master can take it.
6192355000977582 Who is this brave storekeeper?
6192355000977587 Forget it. So, are you interested in the deal?
6192355000977588 How much for the revolver?
6192355000977589 Ah, Bad Grief… Why am I not surprised?
6192355000977590 Three thousand.
6192355000977591 Are you nuts? I don't have this sort of money.
6192355000977592 What's your price?
6192355000977593 Fair enough. Show me.
6192355000977594 I can wait for two days. If you don't take it by then, I'll do business with someone else. My circumstances are humble.\nAs for the money, you'll have no trouble getting it. Isidor must have left you inheritance. It's hard to talk about it now, I understand, but business is business.
6192355000977595 Inheritance, pah… I suspect I'll have a hard time obtaining it.
6192355000977596 Drop it. I didn't come here for the inheritance, I wanted to see my father!
6192355000977598 Secondly, Isidor must have taught you how to hear and pick medicinal herbs. They're in bloom now. And merchants in the Broken Heart would give you a decent price for them.
6192355000977599 Yeah, I know a thing or two about herbs.
6192355000977600 Fine. I'll be back tomorrow, or maybe even today.
6192355000977601 Can I at least take a look at the revolver?
6192355000982151 Steeper
6192355000985051 I want to ask Sahba how to make all those hundreds of people obey me. It's important! They won't listen!
6192355000985052 Should they?
6192355000985053 Wow. Actual hundreds?
6192355000985054 I say, "Stop knocking!" But they knock. I say, "Let me take a look at all my domain!" But they won't. I say, "I want a new calf!" They bow silently and walk out. But I don't need a bow! I need a calf!
6192355000985055 Perhaps you should agree to a pony?
6192355000985056 Outrageous.
6192355000985057 Well… more. But I can only count to a hundred for now.
6192355000985058 Then better ask Sahba to teach you numbers.
6192355000985059 Even more? Who are those people?
6192355000989351 My father's house. My house.
6192355000989751 My father's house. My house.
6192355000995051 Really? You do look like a steppe person. Who are you then?
6192355000995052 Right… I suppose people jumping from its windows just wanted to let some air in.
6192355000995053 Wake up! Someone's looking for you! C'mon!
6192355000995054 Who?
6192355000995055 Don't <i>c'mon</i> me, kid. I'm coming.
6192355000995056 Someone important. I wouldn't be waking you otherwise.
6192355000995057 If it's not Simon Kain himself, you are <i>so</i> grounded.
6192355000995058 What time is it?
6192355000995059 I can tell you what time it isn't—it <i>isn't</i> time to sit on your hands. People always wake doctors up. That's what the Old Man used to say…
6192355000995060 Yeah, he did. Thanks for the heads-up.
6192355000995061 Well excuse me, doctor, for being cranky. Us paramedics should really be humbler around you.
6192355000995063 What are you planning to do? Where will you start?
6192355000995064 I'll start with thinking hard about the challenge you posed to me.
6192355000995065 I'll look closer at the kids. Why'd he gather them? Who is this Eighth? Suspicious…
6192355000995066 I should have gone to see Grace first. Hope there's still a chance.
6192355000995067 I should have gone to see Grace first. Hope there's still a chance.
6192355000995068 Have you forgotten out faces already? We asked you for help. We wanted to be let into the Warrens.
6192355000995069 …Right. I couldn't persuade Big Vlad. Here's your money.
6192355000995070 I've got nothing to tell you.
6192355000995071 What about our money?
6192355000995072 I had to spend it. Sorry.
6192355000995073 Oh yeah… here is it. Have it back.
6192355000995077 By the way, have you heard about Saburov looking for volunteer patrolmen? \nPlease tell me it's not to send a new raiding party after you. I'll sigh with relief knowing that the man merely wants to instill martial law in our godforsaken village. I like knowing what my competitors think.
6192355000995078 No, we've talked already. It's not about me.
6192355000995079 Heh… Funny indeed.
6192355000995080 Actually, I'd be happy to volunteer. It's honest work and a piece of bread, at least for now.
6192355000995081 We're closing.
6192355000995082 You don't seem too inviting. Isn't it a bit too early to close?
6192355000995083 Where's Var?
6192355000995084 I don't know who you're talking about.
6192355000995085 He would. I'm Isidor Burakh's son.
6192355000995086 It's my shop. I can close it whenever I please. What did you want?
6192355000995087 I want to see Var.
6192355000995088 I brought meat.
6192355000995089 But I know him. And I know what he sells. And I have it with me. And it's the kind of goods that spoils quickly. So?
6192355000995090 The door to your right. Then turn left. Then go ahead. And don't take long.
6192355000995091 That's up to me, pal.
6192355000995092 Got it. You, keep closing. You were closing the shop, right?
6192355000995093 Your son spends all his time up there?
6192355000995151 A children's stash is here somewhere.
6192355000995152 
6192355000995153 
6192355000995154 Boös wants to talk to me about my inheritance… My home.
6192355000995155 
6192355000995156 
6192355000995157 Georgiy Kain plans to take our house. If only I remembered where exactly to find him…
6192355000995158 Georgiy Kain plans to take our house. I've no intention to live there, but I have every right to sell it myself. \n\nIf only I remembered where exactly to find him…
6192355000995159 
6192355000995160 
6192355000995161 The Judge changed his mind. The Kains are strange.\n\nTo prove my rights of ownership, I need to hand the paper signed by the Judge to the Hindquarters district prefect.
6192355000995162 
6192355000995163 
6192355000995164 Anyone is free to take anything in the houses contaminated by odd black smog.
6192355000995165 
6192355000995166 
6192355000995167 My rights to the house have been restored.
6192355000996451 I'm listening.
6192355000996452 Were you the person who left my father a note? It was attached to a key.
6192355000997351 
6192355000997352 
6192355000997353 There is a familiar name on Father's list.
6192355000997851 Boös Vlad took an interest in me. He might know something useful.
6192355000997852 
6192355000997853 
6192355000997854 Home sweet home is locked. The local authorities must have the key.
6192355000997855 
6192355000997856 
6192355000997857 This house has been defiled. I don't want to live in a place where his blood was spilled. \n\nBut leaving empty-handed doesn't sound like a good idea either.
6192355000997858 
6192355000997859 
6192355000997860 It's been foretold I will "spill a river of blood" soon. Guess someone will find their death under my knife, after all.
6192355000997861 
6192355000997862 
6192355000997863 It's been foretold I will "spill a river of blood" soon. Guess someone will find their death under my knife, after all.
6192355000997864 Capella is the leader of the Town's children. She might know what Father wanted with the ones on his list.
6192355000997865 There is a familiar name on the list: Capella. That's what they call Olgimsky's daughter. A mature girl the other kids flock to. If anyone knows about the list, it's her.
6192355000997866 Kids sometimes spend their time at the Station.
6192355000997867 Sometimes after dark, steppe people meet at Sahba's place… Not just them, either.
6192355000997868 Sometimes after dark, steppe people meet at Sahba's place… Not just them, either. Even if Sahba's not around anymore, her place remains.
6192355000997869 
6192355000997870 
6192355000997871 Murky was unhelpful. Should I return to Grace, perhaps?
6192355000997872 Father is dead. I won't waste a girl's life to touch him one last time.
6192355000997873 
6192355000997874 
6192355000997875 Five years ago, soon after I left the Town, an outbreak of a horrible disease happened here. Father… destroyed it. \n\nTogether with the carriers.
6192355000997876 Not everyone who came to pay final respects to Father knew him well, but someone here must have.
6192355000997878 There was a list of… patients, maybe?… in Father's vessel thing. These look like children's nicknames.\n\n1. Sticky\n2. Capella\n3. Murky\n4. Notkin\n5. Khan\n6. Grace\n7. Taya Tycheek\n8. ["Udurgh" sigil]
6192355000998551 Aspity
6192355000998552 I loved your father, emshen. Few did. All he got was respect.
6192355000998553 Is that so? Why?
6192355000998554 Who are you, khetey?
6192355000998555 He wanted change. Bothered those who feared change. Made them feel anxiety and pain. Few people liked it.
6192355000998556 But you did, huh?
6192355000998557 Yes. That's the kind of man he was.
6192355000998558 Your father made me. Created me out of clay, so to speak. He's the one who called me Sahba. Before that, I was Usp'tae. Few liked that.\nI am evil, emshen. People fear me. And for a good reason, too. But I can see your father in you, so I will be your trusted friend, kholboön.
6192355000998559 So what do you want from me, khetey?
6192355000998560 Sounds great. Can't say that many people want to be my friends these days.
6192355000998561 I've been looking for you for a while. Where were you? What were you doing? Why haven't you come to bury your father?
6192355000998562 I… I didn't even know.
6192355000998563 I had no time.
6192355000998564 I was in jail. Arrested yesterday.
6192355000998565 Follow me, emshen.
6192355000998566 Who are you?
6192355000998568 I saw you. Back there, at the funeral.
6192355000998569 Don't you want to accept your father's inheritance?
6192355000998570 Did he leave me one?
6192355000998571 I don't. Leave me alone.
6192355000998572 He did. Be khara, this is the most important thing to ever happen to you. Let's go.
6192355000998573 Let's go.
6192355000998574 Shame. He needed you. Waited for you.
6192355000998575 A shame indeed.
6192355000998576 Needed me? Why?
6192355000998577 You are his son. How is a man to be buried without his son's will? He was lying in the open for a while. Refused to go into the ground. So we had to give him to the sky.
6192355000998578 What do you mean?
6192355000998852 There's some sort of trouble brewing in the Hindquarters and around.
6192355000998853 I'm aware… Yes, I'm aware of that, my boy. \nWhat's going on in the Hindquarters? What's that floating dirt folk babble on about? My Factory doesn't fume like that, no… I keep my property nice and tidy.
6192355000998854 I don't know. Everyone's confused.
6192355000998855 I'm ready to sell you the house, boös.
6192355000998856 Glad to hear it. We'll speak about this later.
6192355000998857 I thought you gave me your word.
6192355000998858 Very well. I'm not in a hurry.
6192355000998859 Whatever it is, people are suffering out there.
6192355001005451 I've carried this thing for several days. It wasn't easy, of course. With this, I share with you my fear, my sorrow, and my anger. It was tough, but now it's become a little easier. Just a little.\nThank you for easing my burden.
6192355001005452 In return, I give you some of my grief.
6192355001005453 With this, I give you some of my hope. We have no doctor now… Who will help us? Who will treat our injuries, or deliver children?\nYou're a surgeon. You can do all that. So have some of our hope. And hope often leads to love.
6192355001005454 With this item, I give you… uh, I don't know. Whatever you want.
6192355001005455 Great. With this item, I give you… some of my luck, I guess? People say I have that in spades. Don't know if I believe it.\nNow, what shall you give me?
6192355001005456 Patience.
6192355001005457 Uh, whatcha giving me with this thing?
6192355001005458 What are <i>you</i> giving <i>me?</i>
6192355001005461 Some of us wait for you at the Square. The Bridge Square, that is. In the Stone Yard. You know how to get there?
6192355001005462 Why there? I don't go there often.
6192355001005463 Hey, uncle… Dig a hole for us, will you?
6192355001005464 What for?
6192355001005467 You've interrupted a difficult conversation. I think you should leave.
6192355001005468 Perhaps I can help?
6192355001005469 What are you doing here?
6192355001005470 What's your name, girl?
6192355001005471 I understand there are things you want to know. You think we might tell you, if you ask right. But we won't. Not now. You're an interloper.
6192355001005472 Fine. I'm leaving then.
6192355001005473 You are two serious girls…
6192355001005474 Parleying. It's our business.
6192355001005475 I'd like to know more.
6192355001005476 All right. I'm leaving.
6192355001005477 So why did you interrupt our argument?
6192355001005478 What argument?
6192355001005479 What's it to you?
6192355001005480 There used to be two Mistresses, right? Nina and Victoria. One burned; the other soothed. Nina died, so Katerina replaced her. Then Victoria died, and Katerina was torn apart. Now there are no more mistresses. The Town is unprotected. Do you follow?
6192355001005481 Not really.
6192355001005482 I do.
6192355001005483 <i>Q.E.D.</i> \nBut it's none of your concern, Burakh. So you bumped into us accidentally, whatever. But why couldn't you keep your big mouth shut? Don't you understand that words have power? You utter a word 'cause you're bored, and the whole future changes.
6192355001005484 It changes constantly.
6192355001005485 I'm terse, actually.
6192355001005486 Nina and Victoria are dead. Katerina is incapable. So their daughters are coming into power. There have always been two Mistresses. Now there are three of us. That's too many. Only one will remain. Do you get just how important that is?
6192355001005487 And the lucky one will be you, of course.
6192355001005488 It sounds crazy.
6192355001005489 Perhaps.
6192355001005490 Maybe I should go back to them and tell them of your good intentions.
6192355001005491 Good luck, then.
6192355001005492 Listen carefully, Burakh. Look at me. I will make it so that you can only talk to people when it doesn't interfere with my plans. This is your first warning. If you get in my way again, I'll take your speech away completely. Got it?
6192355001005493 Nope.
6192355001005494 Well, now I'll go back and talk to the girls just to spite you. I love meddling with the future.
6192355001005495 It's not your doing. I wasn't always able to speak to who I wanted to before, either.
6192355001005496 Oh, so you don't believe me? Be my guest. Go back and talk to the girls, then. Or try to.
6192355001005497 You're a funny girl…
6192355001005498 I do believe you. Take pity on my poor soul.
6192355001005499 Listen to me! You're doing the wrong thing! You're getting in everyone's way. You rip a very delicate web with your rough paws. You Burakhs are only good at tearing, never connecting. Ripper…
6192355001005500 That's my job.
6192355001005501 We're good at both. You'll see.
6192355001005502 Do you need me to explain like you're two? You approach someone I have a plan for. You try to talk to them. And nothing happens. Your mouth won't open. Clear now?
6192355001005503 I think you're confusing yourself with God.
6192355001005504 How will I know who you have plans for?
6192355001005505 By trying and failing to talk to them.
6192355001005506 Fair enough.
6192355001005507 Thanks for the fun.
6192355001005508 Where do you think you're going, buddy?
6192355001005509 I just wanna ask something…
6192355001005510 Greetings. I am sorry to inform you that you're officially banned from joining the watch. Governor's orders.
6192355001005511 Am I banned because I'm a doctor? I should be free to do whatever I want.
6192355001005512 Saburov sure seems ready to take up the reins of power. It's about time, if you ask me.
6192355001005513 Why is that?
6192355001005514 It does seem rough to the touch. Have you tried? They say it is. Even if it doesn't look it. Looks greasy, though.\nIt's like that saying, what was it…
6192355001005515 What's that mold?
6192355001005516 The house is all sick. Must be shingles.\nVerochka had shingles last year. Mom thought it was the coughs, but then the doctor said it was just shingles. "Rash shingles." Got it from a cat. That's what he said.
6192355001005517 But the house isn't alive.
6192355001005520 Look alive, brothers and sisters! This one is in cahoots with Notkin's crew. So tell me, old man… Which side are you really on?
6192355001005522 So what did they tell you?
6192355001005523 You kids play curious games these days… Our times were simpler.
6192355001005524 …It doesn't work.
6192355001005525 How long ago did it break?
6192355001005526 Whoa! WHOOOA! What is it—? How is it—? Whoa!
6192355001005527 This is our town.
6192355001005528 Do you have fresh nuts? We can trade them for rare ones.
6192355001005529 Hungry?
6192355001005532 She's always like that! Always wants to go first! We want to play, too!
6192355001005533 Hey, this is no place for children. Do you even know what happened here yesterday?
6192355001005534 I'll be the witch! I'll be the witch!
6192355001005535 You're not afraid of fire, are you?
6192355001006351 
6192355001007051 What made you think so?
6192355001007052 Well, it was signed with your initials, and I thought…
6192355001007053 Just a guess.
6192355001007054 So there was a key, huh?
6192355001007055 Yes.
6192355001007056 I don't throw keys around… I keep them close. Your father had his own house, and he never locked it… Always open… Unafraid of thieves…\nThank you, Master Burakh, for letting me know. I'll be sure to investigate… this mysterious key.
6192355001007057 Don't. I'm sorry I bothered you.
6192355001007058 Not every key in this town is yours to throw around, boös.
6192355001007059 …No, nothing. I just realized I'm talking to the wrong man.
6192355001007060 Signed "V.O."
6192355001007061 More than one person in the world happens to have these initials… but not all of them have keys to spare. \nI think I know who V. O. is. Ugh… Indeed that son of mine is punishment from God… plotting behind my back now… but I'll get to him.
6192355001007062 How is it a bad thing?
6192355001007063 So that was your son, huh? Also a Vlad Olgimsky…
6192355001007851 Yeah, yeah. Only I'm not an old man. I'm a man who has no time for idle chatter and hates it when people clutter their room for now reason.\nCome back when you have meat.
6192355001007852 Got it, you spider of a man. See you.
6192355001007853 You live in a drugstore. A shop. I have every right to be here.
6192355001008851 I've found a note and a key in Father's house. Signed, "V.O." Were you the one who granted him access to a Factory cellar?
6192355001008852 So you've found it… I hope you had enough sense not to mention it to my father, also a "V.O.", who happens to own the Factory, all its cellars, and all its workers.
6192355001008853 Whoa. You rebelled against your father? How did it happen?
6192355001008854 I've talked to him. But I didn't go into details.
6192355001008857 Yes, you're the man who buys blood. I remember. Just curious what you need help with.
6192355001008858 This house smells of blood.

6192355001011851 When a person finds themselves in a relatively enclosed space, it influences their inner state in a certain way. It's no secret.\nThe Kains are trying to create buildings that enhance spiritual growth.
6192355001011852 …As in?
6192355001011853 Well, we're moving to the field of philosophy now… Not my area of expertise.\nBut as far as I can tell, in their eyes, humans aren't paragon of animals, but rather larvae. They believe the human spirit is a spring to be stretched. Their favorite image.
6192355001011854 Why stretch it?
6192355001011855 I'm sorry for saying this, but it's ridiculous.
6192355001011856 Nah, they've just let their wealth go to their heads. Huge fortunes, weird fantasies, and unrestricted power will do that to people.
6192355001011859 To make people desire new things. Weird things. Things beyond their limits.
6192355001011860 Such attempts do not bode well.
6192355001011861 People do that their whole lives anyway.
6192355001011862 …Does that <i>really</i> demand making roads so confusing?

6192355001013157 I've bartered with most elements of the Town. Now they'll accept me back as their own.
6192355001013158 A children's stash is here somewhere. And more players of the Game spend their time nearby. I should keep my eyes peeled.

6192355001021752 The air feels solid around this house.
6192355001022351 Oops! Hush! You shouldn't know about this. Just forget it!
6192355001022352 I heard nothing.
6192355001024251 There are ferrymen in the town. They're waiting for me.
6192355001024252 
6192355001024253 I think they really took me for father's murderer. The rumor will spread in no time.
6192355001024254 People hide their eyes when they see me.
6192355001024255 People avoid me in the streets.
6192355001024256 People lock their windows and hide children when I approach.
6192355001024257 There's a hunt going on, looking for a person with my features.

6192355001029561 Here, have this item. This is for you.
6192355001029562 What's this?
6192355001029753 Taya Tycheek… So she's in there, huh?
6192355001029754 Yes.
6192355001029755 And I was just looking for her.
6192355001029758 Yeah, I already know she's in there. I, too, would have liked to see her.
6192355001029759 We went to the Warren, we stood by its walls, we hoped to be let in the ark. The pest is spreading across the Town, we wanted to hide.\nIf we can't get to Mother Taya, we can at least find refuge at Sahba. She is also like a mother to us. She will teach us how to protect ourselves.
6192355001029760 Children of many mothers, aren't you… Even Mother Boddho caresses your step still.
6192355001029761 Well, here's what I'll say: You were wrong to have come to this town. You should have stayed back in the steppe.
6192355001029762 Bite kharaan, you're back. What say you?
6192355001029763 Who are you?
6192355001029764 Lucky you.
6192355001029765 People don't dig holes in this town. Don't you know?
6192355001029768 Please, uncle… We only need a shallow one! A couple of shovel swings, nothing more!
6192355001029769 Are you burying a cat?
6192355001029770 Yeah. I mean… no. Not a cat.
6192355001029771 Then whom?
6192355001029772 Just… the Eighth.
6192355001029773 Huh? The eighth what?
6192355001029774 Well, the previous seven are already pushing the daisies. And nothing bad happened when we buried them! Because the holes were shallow.
6192355001029775 I guess shallow ones are allowed… All right. I'll dig you a hole.
6192355001029776 No, kids. One should not dig holes in the ground. Period.
6192355001029777 We need it.
6192355001029778 I don't think you do.
6192355001029780 This is actually hard work. What would be my reward?
6192355001029781 A burial gift. Everyone gets to take something away from a funeral. That's why we're holding it!
6192355001029782 Are you burying a cat?
6192355001029783 No, kids. You know full well that I can't.
6192355001032051 Kids are doing something here.
6192355001032052 Kids want me to fix their lantern. I'll need a handful of metal scrap.
6192355001032053 Kids gather here at night.
6192355001032054 Kids gather here some evenings.

6192355001033964 I need the stems of bloody and brown twyre, and swevery.
6192355001033965 I need the stems of black and bloody twyre.
6192355001033966 I need the stems of black and brown twyre.
6192355001033967 I need the stems of bloody and brown twyre.
6192355001033968 I need the stems of black twyre, and swevery.
6192355001033969 I need the stems of bloody twyre, and swevery.
6192355001033970 I need the stems of brown twyre, and swevery.
6192355001033971 Now I only need the stem of black twyre.
6192355001033972 Now I only need the stem of bloody twyre.
6192355001033973 Now I only need the stem of brown twyre.
6192355001033974 Now I only need to find swevery.
6192355001033975 I've collected all the herbs. 
6192355001036651 
6192355001038751 I'm here on important business.
6192355001038752 Everyone here wants to ask something.
6192355001038753 I'm not here to join the watch. I'm a doctor.
6192355001038754 I don't give a damn. Wait for your turn like everyone else.
6192355001038755 Must be nice to have all time in the world.
6192355001038756 Everyone is here on important business.
6192355001038757 I'm not here to join the watch!
6192355001038758 Whatever.
6192355001038759 Get off my case.
6192355001038760 Because you can't trust people, that's why! The rule of the three families was about trust—in each other and in the townsfolk. The damned nobles trusted people to govern themselves. \nAnd the people? They are unruly beasts. They don't respond to kindness, only strength.
6192355001038761 In my experience, people respond better to kindness.
6192355001038762 Our rulers were kind and lenient. Where did it get us? Yesterday blood flowed like water, and a woman was burned to death at the Bone Stake Lot!\nTrust! Pah! Leniency leads to corruption. What we need is someone who can keep the rabble in check.
6192355001038763 There's no point in arguing with you lot…
6192355001038764 Yeah, it's about time.
6192355001038765 Speaking of strength… How do I join the town watch?
6192355001038766 Open your eyes, the line is right there.
6192355001038767 Why does Saburov need so many people?
6192355001038768 It wasn't kindness that killed those people.
6192355001038769 I can see your point.
6192355001038770 To maintain order, of course. To prevent yesterday's nightmare from ever happening again.\nOlgimsky only cares about what he owns. The Kains treat the whole Town as family—no wonder they got soft. Now, they're all getting their comeuppance.
6192355001038771 So you think people are unworthy of trust?
6192355001038772 Why? Did you run out of leather caps? I can get my own.
6192355001038773 I would like to remind you that you're currently on probation. Until the murderer of Simon Kain, Isidor Burakh, and several others is brought to justice, you're still considered a suspect. There's evidence against you.
6192355001038774 Enough blabbering. I'd rather speak to Saburov himself. Is he inside?
6192355001038775 How many times do I have to say it? I'm innocent!
6192355001038777 Are you here about the house?
6192355001038778 Yes, I am here about the house.
6192355001038779 What house?
6192355001038780 Your own, of course. \nOn governor's orders, it was locked down during the investigation of Isidor Burakh's death. Since the investigation's over, the governor can grant you access. Isn't that why you're here?
6192355001038781 I guess it is now…
6192355001038782 I'm here about something else.
6192355001038783 A sign of trust.\nAs we share things with each other, so do we share our feelings. Warmth. Kindness. We see now that you're a good person. The Town trusts you. Do you want to become its part?
6192355001038784 Well… Yes, I guess.
6192355001038785 I <i>am</i> its part.
6192355001038786 I know this game. We barter and share.
6192355001038787 Huh. Unexpected.
6192355001038788 Do you like the item I've given you? Will you find any use for it? I don't really know what you need… I chose randomly. We don't know you very well yet.
6192355001038789 What do you want in exchange?
6192355001038790 It doesn't matter! All that matters is that there <i>was</i> an exchange. You give me something of yours and receive something of mine.\nAll items are charged with bits of your warmth and life… Give me whatever you want. To others, give what <i>they</i> want. They won't ask a lot. So if you share generously and give more than is asked, the Town will remember that.\nIt's just a token, after all. A tradition.
6192355001038791 Others?
6192355001038792 I don't really need anything.
6192355001038793 Yes. Go and barter with different people. Not anyone in particular, just… different. Women and men, teenagers and little kids. You'll see what happens.
6192355001038794 And what happens?
6192355001038795 You'll get to know us better. We'll get to know you better. Our town is like a family.\nYou have returned. Now, please help us remember, accept, and maybe even love you. I'm saying it on behalf of everyone.
6192355001038796 Bayarlaa, basaghan. Please relay my gratitude to them.
6192355001038797 I know this tradition…
6192355001038798 I won't do it. I don't need your love.
6192355001038799 I'll look like an idiot. That's what will happen.
6192355001038800 Well, at least I'll know what each of you is interested in this September. That'll come in handy.
6192355001038801 Just have some of my warmth. Warmth is life.
6192355001038802 I give you only this item. Perhaps you'll find it useful.
6192355001038803 I haven't carried this item for long. There's little of me in it. Still, have some of my warmth.
6192355001038804 I share with you some of my grief, because it's all that I have for now. I'm sorry, basaghan.
6192355001038805 Courage.
6192355001038806 Compassion.
6192355001038807 Care.
6192355001038808 Wit. That's what we all need the most now.
6192355001038809 Oh… I don't know.
6192355001038810 No, that's not how it works. Don't you know the rules?
6192355001038811 All right, I'll give you… uh… hmm. What would you like?
6192355001038812 Some rest.
6192355001038813 Well… a little joy, I suppose.
6192355001038814 A couple of nice dreams.
6192355001038815 Well, neither do I.
6192355001038816 To leave this place.
6192355001038817 To have my father back, little one. But that's only a dream.
6192355001040752 Lancet
6192355001042851 Depends on who you are.
6192355001042856 We're the Dogheads, and they're the Soul-and-a-Halves. We're above, and they're below. We live in the Tower, and they crawl in the Earth. They're drawn to animals, and we reach for the stars. What's so hard to comprehend?
6192355001042857 So, you're the good guys, and they're the bad?
6192355001042858 I'm on my own.
6192355001042859 Are you dumb? This isn't a game of cops and robbers, it's serious stuff. They're pulling the Town one way, and we, another.
6192355001042860 How does that even work?
6192355001042861 I see. Got a little war on your hands, eh?
6192355001042862 I don't feel dumb.
6192355001042863 That's our great conflict, old man. The Soul-and-a-Halves see our Tower as the root of all evils, and we can't live without it. The Tower makes people into super-people. The Soul-and-a-Halves would rather become mindless pets.
6192355001042864 So if they want to be beasts, why are you the ones wearing the dog masks?
6192355001042865 You know, I think I got it. You've explained it pretty well.
6192355001042866 For a good reason. These masks remind us we're still beasts, and the true humans inside us are yet to come out. They can't see well, are almost deaf, and speak only in gibberish. Lots of room left for growth.
6192355001042867 And what's with the four on one?
6192355001042868 What do you even want, big man? Have you come to drag us home? Tough luck. We're going home when we want and not a minute earlier.
6192355001042869 As I see it, there's a fight brewing here. What's the problem, kids?
6192355001042870 Can't you just leave them alone?
6192355001042871 It's <i>they</i> who won't leave <i>us</i> alone. Day after day they lure our guys outside and take them down.
6192355001042872 And what's with the four on one?
6192355001042873 First off, it's four on one and a Half. He does have half a soul more than ordinary folk. Second, we're not here to kick his ass. They're the ones keen on bashing us with clubs and worse.\nUs, we're a peaceful bunch. We fight only in self-defense.
6192355001042874 Why did you drive him up there like a cat up a tree…?
6192355001042875 We're teaching him discipline. He should get used to heights.
6192355001042876 I've had my fill of such "teachers."
6192355001042877 Aren't you upstanding citizens.
6192355001042878 You don't mind if I go upstairs and talk to him too, do you?
6192355001042879 Go ahead, who's stopping you? See for yourself—the higher you go, the better it gets.
6192355001042880 Great. See ya.
6192355001042881 I find the down below no less fascinating.
6192355001042882 Pfft, yeah, right. Have fun with all the stiffs and maggots around you.
6192355001042883 That's not all there is.
6192355001042884 Can't argue with that.
6192355001042885 Will they beat you if you get down?
6192355001042886 Hell if I know…
6192355001042887 Do you need help?
6192355001042888 And they said there's more than one of you here. But I only see you.
6192355001042889 My half went to the Warehouses to call for help.
6192355001042890 So, a huge fight is brewing, huh?
6192355001042891 That's all right. All will be quiet when we gather at the Station this evening. That's our no man's land. A good place.
6192355001042892 So you gather at the Cargo Station?
6192355001042893 It used to be peaceful. Each gang only mingled with their own. But recently, it escalated into outright war. To be honest, we struck first… but that's 'cause they got under our skin.\nYou be on your way, big man. Adults have no business with our wars.
6192355001042894 Are you sure you don't need my help?
6192355001042895 We'll manage on our own.
6192355001042896 As you wish.
6192355001042897 To be fair, it's beautiful up here…
6192355001042898 That you're in team "no heights."
6192355001042899 I'm in team freedom. And our team dislikes zealots. We don't appreciate being dragged by the collar to turn into angels, or wind, or whatever… All in good time.
6192355001042900 I see. Do you need help?
6192355001042901 Oh, I see. So how bad do you beat them?
6192355001042902 Maybe I can parley peace between your two factions?
6192355001042903 You're one of Notkin's, right? We had a curious conversation yesterday.
6192355001042904 You're one of Notkin's, right? We had a curious conversation yesterday.
6192355001042905 Notkin does everything right. Fast on the draw. His father got killed in the war, mom died during childbirth. Most of our lot are orphans. That's why we're tough.
6192355001042906 So they come to preach, and you answer with sticks?
6192355001042907 I see… Damn this war.
6192355001042908 Stop prying. Grown-ups are not welcome where we gather. You ruin everything.
6192355001042909 If you don't like me, I'll leave and won't ever return.
6192355001042910 Yeah, I've heard.
6192355001042911 At the Passenger one. We used to gather at the Cargo, it was cooler. But now it's all boarded off. You'll only end up with broken legs, and we've got girls and little kids there, too… So now we gather at the platform.
6192355001042912 I'll drop by, if that's fine by you.
6192355001042913 I'll just peek with one eye.
6192355001042914 Fair enough.
6192355001042915 Each has two eyes and two ears. Most have one nose and one mouth.\nRiddle me this: If eyes and ears were switched, what would be right? If noses and mouths were switched, what would be fixed?
6192355001042916 That's a tough one.
6192355001042917 Nothing. Everything is fine the way it is.
6192355001042918 Just eat less before you go to sleep, and you'll stop having nightmares.
6192355001042951 
6192355001042952 
6192355001043351 
6192355001043352 What's wrong with her? We didn't do anything, I swear! We saw her crying, asked what happened. But she just bawled even more. Eh, girls…
6192355001043353 Maybe she's hungry?
6192355001043376 Why aren't you running away? Aren't you scared? Boo!
6192355001043377 Of course I'm scared. But I'm a brave man.
6192355001044351 
6192355001044365 What are you gawking at? Do you know who he is? He's Whitebeard's son! His dad went crazy yesterday and hurt people!
6192355001044366 So?
6192355001044370 
6192355001044371 My dad didn't hurt anyone yesterday! Tell them to get off me!
6192355001044372 I'll handle this.
6192355001044373 Even if he did, it wasn't <i>your</i> fault…
6192355001046051 На Пустыре Костного Столба происходит расправа над некой «людоедкой».
6192355001046151 "Rough as dutch, safe to touch. Smooth as bone, leave it alone."
6192355001046152 Yeah, that one…\nOnly, I always thought it was about the road less taken and such? "Rough" means a hard choice; "smooth," taking an easy path. And we all know where those lead… Right?
6192355001046153 What is this… mold?
6192355001046154 Right.
6192355001046155 Who knows. Something's wrong with the air. This must be it. Some sort of soot from the Factory… Guess that's why it was shut down.\nOnly… it's growing fast, and the tinge is wrong. I wonder what they used for fuel there…
6192355001046156 Like I know.
6192355001046157 I really should leave this place, breathing this soot can't be healthy… Right?
6192355001046158 Sure. No need to take pointless risks.
6192355001046159 Soot would spread evenly. And this is some sort of mold.
6192355001046160 And who is that, touching this thing? That can't be a good idea! "Rough as dutch…"
6192355001046161 Who told you that? All the houses are alive around here.
6192355001046162 Come on. It's made of stone and wood.
6192355001046163 What doctor was that?
6192355001046164 Grandfather Isidor. He's a good doctor. He gave Verochka an ointment from herbs and ground stuff, and she got better in a week. Only we had to cut her hair.\nIf you ever get sick, go to him. He'll cure you in a second.
6192355001046165 No, he won't. You'll have to come to me now, with your shingles and measles.
6192355001046167 Thanks, kiddo. This is great advice. If I ever get sick, I'll go right to him.
6192355001046168 Nuh huh. They can breathe and talk. For real! Don't you believe me?
6192355001046169 Of course I believe you.
6192355001046170 Why did you get all sad all of a sudden?
6192355001046171 Don't mind me.
6192355001046172 So you're saying the house is sick, huh?
6192355001046173 Can't you see? Dad says it's soot. But I don't think it's soot.
6192355001046174 But a house isn't alive. It can't get sick.
6192355001046175 I don't think it's soot, either. I think it's mold.
6192355001046176 When I was your age, everything talked to me too…
6192355001046177 …Ah. Still my same old hometown.
6192355001047251 I'm not crying. I'm not. I'm just… upset. Upset, because they're always picking on me. All the time…
6192355001047252 Who's picking on you, dear?
6192355001047253 Are you playing hide-and-seek?
6192355001047254 Oh, right, sorry. I am. Running away now.
6192355001047255 No, not that! Not hide-and-seek!
6192355001047256 What then?
6192355001047257 Bone leg!
6192355001047258 How do you play that?
6192355001047259 I have bone legs, see? I'm a clay wench! I cannot walk, but whoever sees me runs away in fear. You should run away too!
6192355001047260 But you have normal legs…
6192355001047261 Isn't it boring, just sitting here in one place?
6192355001047262 I'm not bored. Clay wenches don't get bored!
6192355001047263 How do you know so much about them?
6192355001047264 Want me to stand here in your place?
6192355001047265 You're ruining it! Run away already! Ugh, I can't even stomp my foot… I'll bite you!
6192355001047266 Okay, okay…
6192355001047267 You can't reach me.
6192355001047268 So now you want to stone him to death?
6192355001047269 He's the same as his father! Ask him! Ask him why his dad is called Whitebeard. Ask him!
6192355001047270 I'd rather ask you.
6192355001047271 He started it!
6192355001047272 There's a bit too many of you, and only one of him, don't you think?
6192355001047273 Now calm down, everyone.
6192355001047274 I'm not sure I want to.
6192355001047275 That's 'cause he's a drunk! He gets smashed and attacks people! He raised a hand against my mom last year!
6192355001047276 A son does not answer for his father's actions.
6192355001047277 Why do you get in our way? One way or the other, we'll get him.
6192355001047278 Go get his father if you want. But leave the kid alone. I won't tell you twice!
6192355001047279 Scram, will you? You little imps…
6192355001047280 If he grows up to be like his father, then meet here again in ten years. Same place, same people.
6192355001047281 They're saying they didn't do anything to you. So what's going on?
6192355001047282 They say I'm ugly. I know I am… But why do they need to keep saying it all the time?
6192355001047283 Nonsense. You're very pretty.
6192355001047284 You're unlike anyone else. Trust me on that.
6192355001047285 Well, so it goes. Don't worry, you'll grow into your beauty. Maybe.
6192355001047286 Well… Those ones are okay, I guess. But even if they didn't say anything, I know they're thinking about it!
6192355001047287 What do people say to you?
6192355001047288 Everyone.
6192355001047289 How are they picking on you?
6192355001047290 Yeah, girls are… sensitive.
6192355001047291 Just… don't tell her that she's… well, not pretty. Okay?
6192355001047292 But she <i>is</i> okay. Pretty, even, if someone washed her up…
6192355001047293 Exactly.
6192355001047294 So hush. You don't have to say every thought out loud.
6192355001047295 I guess. She must be hungry. Why else would she be crying?
6192355001047296 Or maybe she's lost?
6192355001047297 I guess. She must be lost. Maybe we should take her to the Station?
6192355001047298 And get her on a train to somewhere…
6192355001047299 Trains aren't running now. But… we should probably see if she lives around here.
6192355001047300 Yeah, you do that.
6192355001047301 I'm kidding. Leave her alone. She'll calm down.
6192355001047302 You should go catch a groundhog for her. Or just pick some flowers.
6192355001047303 Everybody knows <i>that!</i> They burned a steppe bogeywoman here. A clay wench of herbs and bones.
6192355001047304 But it's no laughing matter… How can you play this out?
6192355001047305 What are you doing here?
6192355001047306 We're playing.
6192355001047307 Playing what?
6192355001047309 Clay.
6192355001047310 What kind of game is that?
6192355001047311 It's not a good place for games. Shoo.
6192355001047314 No. They burned a living person here. Now scram!
6192355001047315 Well… We're curious.
6192355001047316 They're curious. Bah!
6192355001047317 It's not curious, kids, it is sad.
6192355001047318 Not for long, I'm afraid.
6192355001047319 Huh? What do you mean?
6192355001047320 They're going to tie you up and douse you with kerosine. And when you catch fire, they'll get scared and run away. How do you like that?
6192355001047321 Huh?! What do you mean? That's not funny at all!
6192355001047322 Spot on! It's not funny! You better go play with dolls. Witch, my ass...
6192355001047323 I've been sent here. To make sure that everything is for real.
6192355001047324 I'm dead serious.
6192355001049651 Speak of the devil! You've started to like coming here, haven't you? Are you sure your boots won't wear down?
6192355001049652 Well… I missed you.
6192355001049653 We've been talking, while we were waiting for you.
6192355001049654 What did you talk about?
6192355001049655 Unhappy to see me again?
6192355001049656 Aren't you supposed to be terribly busy? I don't understand why you keep coming.\nOr do you need my help again? I'll wash your clothes. You're filthy, like a chimney sweep. Revolting. While they dry, have some sleep.
6192355001049657 …What's wrong with you, basaghan? Woke up on the wrong side of the bed?
6192355001049658 I hate it when you call me that! Is it so hard to remember? "Basaghan" your steppe girls, not me!
6192355001049659 They're not my steppe girls. They belong to the Kin.
6192355001049660 Fine! What's wrong with you, ekhene?
6192355001049661 All right. Abgay, what got into you today?
6192355001049662 And what does <i>that</i> word mean?
6192355001049663 It's like "the elder sister." Would you prefer that?
6192355001049664 "My sweet." "My dear."
6192355001049665 Yeah…?\nOne of yours came to me today. Asked a lot of questions. Said she was promised you… Said a lot of things… Did you ever promise to marry her?
6192355001049666 Whoa… I'm liking it less and less all of a sudden.
6192355001049667 That's fine. I can do without your help. And I can leave, if you don't want me here.
6192355001049668 I promised her nothing. I don't even remember her. She just keeps… tagging along, asking stupid questions.
6192355001049669 Why in the world should you care?
6192355001049670 Ugh, whatever. Like it's any of my business… Do whatever you want.\nDid you make peace with Stakh?
6192355001049671 Doesn't look like it…
6192355001050251 Thrush
6192355001050252 Measly
6192355001055351 
6192355001055354 
6192355001055355 
6192355001055356 Foreman Oyun wants to see me.
6192355001057151 Cricket
6192355001059953 Kid
6192355001060951 Fresh? As in… not ripe?
6192355001060952 Are <i>you</i> nuts? You can't eat nuts! They're alive!
6192355001060953 Alive?
6192355001060954 You're so dense… We've already heard all these walnuts and chestnuts have to say. So now we can barter them away. The new is always more interesting.
6192355001060955 And what did they have to say?
6192355001060956 They told us that we can find shmowders in this very yard. We call it the Powder Bag. Boka and Turochka used to live here. They were the shmowder-makers…
6192355001060957 "Shmowders"?
6192355001060958 Where are they now?
6192355001060959 They grew up and left. A long time ago! No one's been making new shmowders for a while now… The old stock is all we have left. So we're hunting them down.
6192355001060960 What are these shmowders good for?
6192355001060961 No! Fresh, as in, with fresh people inside!
6192355001060962 What?
6192355001060963 They're like… powders. Very valuable. We'll later trade them for needles, or a knife.
6192355001060964 You're not allowed to carry needles or knives.
6192355001060965 You're so dumb! Think we don't know? That's exactly why we need shmowders. Don't you understand?
6192355001060966 No, I don't.
6192355001060967 Ah, now I see. You kids are little criminals.
6192355001060968 So where are those shmowders of yours hiding?
6192355001060969 How about we play hide-and-seek? We'll look for powders, and you'll look for us.
6192355001060970 No, I'm not good at hide-and-seek.
6192355001060971 Well… All right.
6192355001060972 You're it! Turn around, so that you don't see us, and count to five. Then seek!
6192355001060973 Just to five? Let's see if you're that fast…
6192355001060974 Why make it so complicated?
6192355001060975 Shmowders like hide-and-seek, too. They like to see people play. They get curious. Then it's easier to find them!
6192355001060976 I see… Okay, I'll help you.
6192355001060979 Sorry, kids. This is just too complicated for me.
6192355001060980 Can I have one? Or see one, at least?
6192355001060981 Okay. Ready or not…
6192355001060982 Got it. But no cheating!
6192355001060983 Not all of them, of course. Just the ones that caught someone. A memory, you know? Of a dead person. \nSometimes they tell interesting things. Like ours, they do! You can't imagine how long it took us to get our hands on these...
6192355001060984 Why barter them away then?
6192355001060985 Trading nuts for nuts? Now that's profitable.
6192355001060986 What interesting things? Like, secrets?
6192355001061001 Have you, like, seen them?
6192355001061002 All evidence points to this. They leave strange items in our game. Everyone's scared…\nWe wanted to catch them ourselves at first… But Sleepy Head convinced us it was serious. That we need you. Especially since it does concern you.
6192355001061003 What items?
6192355001061004 Where did they leave those items?
6192355001061005 We've seen whatever they left in our game. That's enough.
6192355001061006 What game?
6192355001061007 So, lemme explain.\nWe have these caches, lots of them, all over the Town. That's where we leave messages and gifts for one another. It's a test of intuition. If you find one, you get to the next level. It also tests greed… Whoever takes items without giving anything in return, gets kicked out. \nBut that's not important. Not what you should be thinking about.
6192355001061008 What should I be thinking about, then?
6192355001061009 Good thinking on Sleepy Head's part.
6192355001061010 All right, I believe you. Now tell me about your game.
6192355001061011 Like hell you are. I know the kind of games you play. I'd be lucky to get out alive…
6192355001061012 Indeed. Indeed, old man! Spot on! Our game seems to be getting dangerous. That's why we're letting you in.
6192355001061013 Are you for real? Am I supposed to be proud?
6192355001061014 Nope, I'll pass. I've no plans to test my courage…
6192355001061015 It's hard and interesting… Or rather, it was, until a murderer joined it.
6192355001061016 What murderer?
6192355001061017 Yeah, let's get down to business.
6192355001061018 The murderer left some items tonight. From the Old Man. Bloody… something, and a scary note, saying they know we'll try to catch 'em, that we're reading it, that they see all.\nIt shook me in my boots!
6192355001061019 Where did you find those items?
6192355001061020 There are two caches nearby: the Dam and the Bowsprit. Go, and you'll see for yourself. \nOnly, if you take from a cache, leave something, too. Respect the rules, or it'll all go south.
6192355001061021 I do respect rules. I will follow them.
6192355001061022 The players already gather here in the Stone Yard. Next to the caches, I mean. They've already been to the Middle Town and the Earth. Maybe they found something there, too.\nI believe three parties are already here. They might know more… But I don't know where they are. I've been standing here waiting for you to pass by like an idiot.
6192355001061023 Thanks for waiting.
6192355001061024 All right… Let's play.
6192355001061025 Three groups of kids scattered across the Stone Yard, huh? Got it.
6192355001061026 The Dam… I think I've been there already. I'll take another look.
6192355001061027 The Bowsprit… You mean the cape, right? The Mistress' tombs? I think I've seen your cache. Didn't know it was a part of a game.
6192355001061028 She's dead. She was only terrifying while she lived.
6192355001061029 How do you even play this game?
6192355001061030 It's a game of trust. You'll figure it out as you play. And we'll figure <i>you</i> out.\nEveryone's wondering what the Old Man's replacement will be like.
6192355001061031 What makes you think I'll replace him?
6192355001061032 Fair enough.
6192355001061033 We sometimes get together in the Nutshell. It's like… a place. We go there in the evening, in the morning, even at noon. All in all, we come and go as we please.\nIf you get a lead, go to the Nutshell, will you? You'll find <i>someone</i> there. Eh?
6192355001061034 Eh.
6192355001061035 See you, kiddos.
6192355001061036 I got it, I got it. I'm quick on the uptake. Just telling you 'cause you wanted to know more about me.
6192355001061037 If you ever talk like that to me again, I'll spank you. Got it?
6192355001061038 Barley who?
6192355001061039 Well, there's this one… fella. Used to be Bad Grief's pal, but then they fell out… Barley split away and founded his own gang. A real, no-nonsense affair, unlike Grief's circus.\nWe would have suspected the man immediately, but we checked him already.
6192355001061040 All right. Anything else?
6192355001061041 Isn't leaving things voluntary? Your rules are yours, I don't have to follow them.
6192355001063356 Is it true you can talk to the dead?
6192355001063358 Can you… let me talk to my father?
6192355001065651 Fancy meeting you here… I was just looking for you!
6192355001065652 I'll return back to my place soon. That is where we'll talk.
6192355001065653 I'll be quick. I was just wondering...
6192355001065654 All right.
6192355001065655 They won't accept you either, khayaala?
6192355001065656 Don't they accept people from the Kin?
6192355001065657 They won't.
6192355001065658 It's not because we're Khatanghe. But Saburov thinks we're boös Vlad's people, and they have an arrangement. Be khara, they won't accept the Kains' people either.
6192355001065659 Be oylgono ougyb, why have you come? The Kin have never cooperated with the authorities.
6192355001065660 And so it will remain while you still think of yourselves as Olgimsky's slaves. It's not he who enslaved you. You enslaved yourselves.
6192355001065661 There's no work. The Factory is closed. Where should I go? How should I feed my children?
6192355001065662 This is not a real job, either… The patrols will be disbanded in a week.
6192355001065663 Aydahamne khүrene, the autumn will be rough.
6192355001065664 It's always been like this.
6192355001065665 Why do you keep it then?
6192355001065666 Well, that can be fixed.
6192355001065667 Really? Can you fix it? Did you have one of these as a kid?
6192355001065668 Oh, no… My toys were much simpler.
6192355001065669 No. But I can try.
6192355001065670 Fly brought it from some sort of dumpster. Looong ago. But now Fly lives in the Tower, and he doesn't come to visit anymore…
6192355001065671 Why aren't you in the Tower, too?
6192355001065672 Would you like me to fix it for you?
6192355001065673 I dunno… Lisa and Mew are here, so I'm here too… We're friends, after all.
6192355001065674 I understand. Friends are important.
6192355001065675 I see.
6192355001065676 This is our history. Its beginning and its current state.
6192355001065677 These are three different worlds in the palm of one hand.
6192355001065678 I sent my little rats to get groceries this morning, and they still haven't come back! I wonder if they think food will miraculously buy itself.
6192355001065679 Are you out of food?
6192355001065680 Have you been living under a rock, darling? Prices are soaring! Salt costs twice as much today as it did yesterday. And where's the grain? I haven't seen wheat in a week. Really, what could happen next?\nThere's <i>still</i> no train. People are worried. What if it never comes? We'll all starve!
6192355001065681 Why don't you get groceries yourself? More reliable than children.
6192355001065682 How can I be in all places at once? Hmm? I have to send the kids. They're probably at that Station of theirs. Thank the heavens they're not in the Tower, at least… I just don't have the heart to whip them.
6192355001065683 What station?
6192355001065684 We'll survive on meat. Olgimsky isn't entirely heartless. He won't let it come to starvation.
6192355001065685 It's a place they hang out, waiting on trains. Better than that damned tower.
6192355001065686 Why don't you go there and fetch them?
6192355001065689 Ha, right… If not for the Kains and the Saburovs, he'd hang himself before he shared anything with the people. You're as naive as a child.\nHmm… I wonder if I should go to the Station and get them…?
6192355001065690 Go where?
6192355001065691 I… don't want to meddle. No, it's all right. At least they're in town, staying close. My neighbor hasn't seen her children in… I don't know <i>how</i> long. That damned Tower took them all.
6192355001065692 Wonderful. I wonder how you cope with that.
6192355001065693 Hey, thanks for reminding me about the prices!
6192355001065694 Oh, I know that place. Back in my day, we liked the big Station more.
6192355001065695 Is she at her place, in the Lump?
6192355001065696 Damned if I know. Either there or at the Station. Just… don't stomp around if you ever go there. It's a discreet place, not for the grown-ups.
6192355001065697 The Station is a discreet place? Trains have become rare indeed…
6192355001065698 I won't stomp around. I'll just take a peek.
6192355001065699 I know, I grew up here.
6192355001065700 You should. It's pretty. Anyway, they thought you went to see the Judge. Kain, I mean. Georgiy.
6192355001065701 I know the Judge's name, thank you.
6192355001065702 They can wait a bit longer.
6192355001065703 No, they can't! Go there. They're doing it for you. You shouldn't keep them waiting. We're not your servants.
6192355001065704 I didn't say anything like that.
6192355001065705 I still have business to attend to.
6192355001065706 Capella said we can't go to the Nutshell until the evening. So we wait.
6192355001065707 The Nutshell? Why's it called that?
6192355001065712 Already forgotten.
6192355001065713 Because it's empty! Plus, it's close to the Station.
6192355001065714 You mean the passenger station?
6192355001065715 You kids really listen to Capella, don't you?
6192355001065716 So boring… How much longer do we have to wander the streets…
6192355001065717 Stop wandering, then.
6192355001065718 It's boring everywhere.
6192355001065719 Is that so? I didn't know. You… surprised me.
6192355001065720 Elaborate.
6192355001065721 I confess I don't know much about the Kains. Still, I believe that my father and your brother were as different as people can get.
6192355001065722 Why today?
6192355001065723 Those are the rules. The Judge's decision is executed on the same day it's made.
6192355001065724 But… why? This sounds inconvenient.
6192355001065725 Convenience is poison. One must accustom themselves to pursue any intention as soon as it appears, regardless of difficulty. Otherwise one burns out, gives in to doubt, starts fearing oneself. The bolder the dream, the more surely it becomes dust when the moment is lost.
6192355001065726 Now I understand.
6192355001065727 I'll never understand you. Your family, I mean.
6192355001065728 I didn't have any secrets from Father. It is strange that I wasn't aware of their friendship. Very strange.
6192355001065729 They both cared about the fate of our town. Your father was all about the people who live in the Lower Town. He wanted to protect the Kin. \nSimon basically invented our town… Designed it. Planned it out like a machine. A special space unlike any other. I think they were brought together by this shared responsibility for the future.
6192355001065730 Intriguing. May I ask you something else?
6192355001065731 I will answer a single question. First off, I am quite busy right now. Secondly, my brother wasn't too forthcoming to me concerning his relationship with your father. This was strange to me, too. \nCome visit me on Sunday, and I will tell you more.
6192355001065732 What was my father's plan for the Town?
6192355001065733 What was my father's plan for the Kin?
6192355001065734 Did Simon and my father disagree strongly on something?
6192355001065735 As far as I know, both of them were concerned about the Town turning out being too extraordinary. Such peculiar towns don't survive for long, just like peculiar people, or animals with rare mutations. An exotic flower won't last in the wild. Without people like Simon, your father, or myself, the Town won't stay the same.
6192355001065736 I understand. Thank you for your answer.
6192355001065739 I'll return on Sunday, then. Thank you. What about the house?
6192355001065740 The Kin are a part of the Town. We live in the age of machines and science. People achieved flight and perform more complex computations every year. \nThe Kin, however, belong to the primal times. Your people think and behave like people did thousands of years ago, when we were barely different from beasts. I hope you are not offended.
6192355001065741 Where does the Town come into this?
6192355001065742 I'll think about what you said.
6192355001065743 I don't get it. I didn't expect to, either.
6192355001065744 We would have examined it first. Its proportions, the taste of the space inside… Every house transforms everyone who spends more than five minutes within. Sometimes this transformation can be influenced or controlled. We have a great interest in these matters. 
6192355001065745 Our house has always been a gloomy place.
6192355001065746 Our house was just a house.
6192355001065747 Is that why you've built so many identical buildings?
6192355001065748 Exactly so. They're identical on the outside. We were interested in how much human presence could change them in return. It was an experiment in mirroring. A juxtaposition of natures. Do you want to ask me anything else?
6192355001065749 No.
6192355001067152 I do, but you seem busy. I'll ask at another time.
6192355001073951 Don't bother searching. Tycheek is dead. Although, I hear his daughter survived.
6192355001073952 That's what matters. I need to take care of her. Take her somewhere safe.
6192355001073956 On the other hand… Wait! Don't interrupt me. I'm thinking. Stand by.
6192355001073957 …
6192355001073958 ……
6192355001073959 ………
6192355001073960 Fine. Have it your way.\nI am relieving the guards. The gate will be unlocked. I think I know an even better way to play this card.
6192355001073961 Thank you.
6192355001073962 Well, that was brutally honest.
6192355001073963 I don't get it. How… you know what, never mind.
6192355001073964 Precisely.
6192355001073965 I'll go now.
6192355001073997 No. A question. Why are you here unguarded?
6192355001073998 I have a guard—a big one, too.
6192355001073999 Yeah? I haven't seen them around.
6192355001074000 It's not the kind of guard you can see. Any other questions?
6192355001074001 Is there a way to protect the Olgimskys? It's urgent.
6192355001074002 Has anyone tried to assassinate you here?
6192355001074003 Every day brings an attempt on my life. This whole damn mission is an attempt on my life. Have I not told you this already?\nBut I appreciate your support. If that's what this is.
6192355001074004 It <i>was</i> support…
6192355001074007 You're shrewd, huh.
6192355001074009 Actually, I do have a request. Vlad Olgimsky.
6192355001074010 To be honest… it's not my purpose, either. I keep forgetting that lately.
6192355001074011 Thanks for telling me that. It puts my mind at ease.
6192355001074013 I wonder!
6192355001074014 I'll have you know that they are free people. Free to do as they choose.
6192355001074015 One man can't order an entire people around.
6192355001074016 We both know that's not true.
6192355001074017 If you foresaw this, why did you not interfere?
6192355001074018 Fine. Arrest me, then.
6192355001074021 Divining? What are you talking about?
6192355001074022 So you haven't even heard? That explains a lot.\nWell, you're quite popular around these parts. I've interrogated several dozen people, and nearly a third pin their hopes on you.\nAnd every other person says that Old Burakh's heir is fated to drown the Town in blood. I believe that was foretold.
6192355001074023 Do you really believe that?
6192355001074024 I believe that a person's behavior is directly influenced by the few pieces of data that get stuck in their head.\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies. "Your children shall be kings," remember that?
6192355001074025 No, where is it from?
6192355001074026 Yes. Well, let them talk, and believe whatever they want.
6192355001074027 An old book.\nDo you realize that every step has already been foreseen and calculated? And I don't mean by myself. To be frank, your predestined future is not interesting enough to concern me.
6192355001074028 Can't say it bothers me.
6192355001078451 
6192355001078452 
6192355001078453 
6192355001078454 Sahba will teach us. She knows the way. She speaks to Earth. Mother Boddho talks to us through her.
6192355001078455 What will she teach you?
6192355001078456 What if she interprets it wrong? You know how it can be.
6192355001078457 She won't. Sahba is dead. And I'm to blame… I think that means I should answer your questions myself.
6192355001078458 She knows our traditions. We have long been oppressed. Now we face extinction. We forget our language, our crafts and arts. The art of talking to Earth, the language of herbs, the craft of Lines. She advises well.
6192355001078459 Well. Good luck remembering.
6192355001078460 What advising do you need?
6192355001078461 She won't advise you anymore.
6192355001078462 Impossible. It's not religious. Just wisdom. Mundane advice. Heart will tell if she's wrong, certainly, but Sahba rarely is.
6192355001078463 Oh… So she does make mistakes, after all.
6192355001078464 So she's a teacher to you?
6192355001078465 Not a simple one.
6192355001078466 I'm sure it's simpler than you think.
6192355001078467 That wasn't an offer, by the way. I'm a bad advisor.
6192355001078468 I have a question for our mother. \nThere is little time left before it all ends. When it happens, would I be allowed to spare the lives of those who trusted me and called themselves friends? Would I be allowed to not kill them?
6192355001078469 When what happens?
6192355001078470 Yes.
6192355001078471 When the Kin flood the town. When the steppe consumes the streets and houses. What shall I do to people, then?
6192355001078472 Are you all nuts? Just leave people alone.
6192355001078473 Kill everyone. God will tell the good from the bad.
6192355001078474 Dream on…
6192355001078475 I want to ask Sahba.\nWill our brothers and sisters be allowed to marry? The Kin are… well, kin. We're all children of Boddho. And there's so few of us left…
6192355001078476 Bad idea. Such marriages lead to degradation.
6192355001078477 Yeah… You should ask her.
6192355001078478 Marry the townsfolk. That's the only way to survive.
6192355001078479 We're too different.
6192355001078480 No, you're not.
6192355001078481 That's the idea.
6192355001078482 But that doesn't matter. When the Kin swallow the Town, there'll be neither wives nor children.
6192355001078483 …And you'll become the Kin's last generation.
6192355001078484 Dream on.
6192355001078485 I would ask Mother about self-sacrifice. \nShe said we must sacrifice everything for our fellow Kin, as we prepare to flood the Town… I gave everything I had, even my own entrails. Now I'm dying. Did I make the correct decision?
6192355001078486 …What for?
6192355001078487 Wisdom springs from hindsight…
6192355001078488 I will tell it to Sahba. It's a long story. I should save my strength.
6192355001078489 If you're asking me, it was a stupid thing to do.
6192355001078490 You did good.
6192355001078491 I want to abandon my name. So does my family: the etseg eyh, the abgay, the basaghan, the akshan.\nWhy would we need names? We're no one.
6192355001078492 How will you refer to each other, then?
6192355001078493 I agree. All names do is hinder communication.
6192355001078494 We do not need names to call on each other. We do not need words.\nI want to ask our mother if we'd lose anything vital by shedding names.
6192355001078495 You want to abandon your name, but you still refer to yourself with "I." Shouldn't you start with that?
6192355001078496 No. A name is just a shell. Peel it off.
6192355001078497 Your name <i>is</i> you. He who has it, has power over you.
6192355001078498 We want to ask our mother: How can we deny ourselves?\nMy body won't let me forget it. I can't stop loving myself while I still have a body.
6192355001078499 You can try to deny yourself if you want. But why stop loving yourself?
6192355001078500 Then shed your body.
6192355001078501 I don't know. But I can tell that it's a hindrance.\nI want to ask Sahba of this. Let her teach me.
6192355001078502 A curious question indeed.
6192355001078503 Go home. No one can teach you this.
6192355001078504 You don't truly love yourself, I can tell. Learn that first. Love is harder than denial.
6192355001078505 I want to ask our mother about our speech. This foreign tongue impedes us. It slows our minds. How can we refuse it?
6192355001078506 Speak the steppe tongue. Teleghyy yaakhav, naayze.
6192355001078507 Give a vow of silence and be quiet.
6192355001078508 You hear me not, bagshaah. I'm <i>thinking</i> with these words.\nI told you, it's my mind they cripple, not my mouth.
6192355001078509 Why don't you think in the language of your ancestors?
6192355001078510 In that case, how about you lend your brain to someone who'd use it?
6192355001078511 Tegdegh, bagshaa, but it's too bare. Too many new things in life, that have no names in the steppe tongue.
6192355001078512 So there's your answer, then.
6192355001078513 Invent new words. This is how you can serve our people.

6192355001084355 Khooloy
6192355001084356 Amahn
6192355001089251 So you're here, after all?
6192355001089252 Didn't I tell you not to come here?
6192355001089253 Who locked us here? Are your friends playing some kind of awful prank?
6192355001089254 We're dead now. Do you think we'll get sick?
6192355001089255 Most likely.
6192355001089256 We'll see.
6192355001089267 Notkin
6192355001094251 Which department are you from, pal? Cutting?
6192355001094252 In a way.
6192355001094255 It's all because of the damned war. We are losing it. The train that came in June was the last, I just know it. We're not seeing another one.
6192355001094256 I've recently arrived from the outside. Trains still work.
6192355001094263 Seems like some sort of ugliness is happening inside.
6192355001094264 The crows perching directly on the Cathedral are a bad omen.
6192355001094265 Why?
6192355001094266 The crows not being noticed by anyone is a bad omen.
6192355001094267 What kind of omen is that?
6192355001094268 The crows being so numerous this year are a bad omen. Sayn baina, khayaala. How fares your kine?
6192355001094269 Numerous indeed. A beautiful sight, huh?
6192355001094270 
6192355001094271 
6192355001094272 Home is where your friends—your <i>tagloor</i>—are. I wonder how Lara is doing.
6192355001094273 
6192355001094274 
6192355001094275 Without me, our childhood gang—Lara, Grief, and Rubin—ended up barely talking to one another.\n\nPerhaps I can gather everyone back together again? Lara doesn't mind, but what about the other two?
6192355001094276 
6192355001094277 
6192355001094278 I invited Rubin to gather our childhood gang again. He doesn't mind.
6192355001094279 I invited Stakh to our childhood gang meeting. I wonder if he'll come.
6192355001094280 
6192355001094281 
6192355001094282 I invited Rubin to gather our childhood gang again. He doesn't mind.
6192355001094283 I invited Rubin to gather our childhood gang again. I wonder if he'll come.\n
6192355001094284 
6192355001094285 
6192355001094286 I invited Grief to gather our childhood gang again. He doesn't mind.
6192355001094287 I invited Grief to meet old friends. We'll see if he comes…
6192355001094288 
6192355001094289 
6192355001094290 Lara, Bad Grief, Rubin, and I are meeting after midnight in the old place. I hope we can connect again.
6192355001094291 We were planning to gather our childhood gang at the old place, but now is not a good time for nostalgia. \n\nI guess I should apologize to Lara.
6192355001094292 
6192355001094293 
6192355001094294 Perhaps old friendships can be mended… but our lives will never be the same again.
6192355001094295 Perhaps old friendships can be mended, but even that doesn't seem to work out… In any case, our lives will never be the same again.
6192355001095051 …You've got a shmowder on you.
6192355001095052 So what?
6192355001095055 Fancy yourself a healer already? Have you mastered the potions your father made? You haven't even found his tools yet!
6192355001095056 I have, actually. They're out of order.
6192355001095057 It's not a toy. It's poison!\nLet me tell you a story. Several years ago, these kids were playing plague. They gathered a pile of pills, ground them up and mixed them… That's where shmowders came from. \nThen, a terrible outbreak happened. Some people believed children's shmowders helped. But they couldn't have! That was their desperation talking!
6192355001095058 I see.
6192355001095059 Do we have time for that?
6192355001095060 Can't you fix them…?
6192355001095061 I can. But getting them to work will take time, and the kid needs help right now.
6192355001095062 A little. Unless someone interferes, he'll die at seven o'clock.
6192355001095063 How do you know?
6192355001095064 No. I used that "shmowder" of yours. I'm not sure it'll work.
6192355001095065 A shmowder? A shmowder?!\nWell… It <i>will</i> work all right. But it only helps with the sand pest, not with any other diseases. And it's dangerous. It can even kill a weak organism… Ugh… You shouldn't have.
6192355001095066 Well, excuse me for giving him whatever I had. So what did that Bachelor want with me?
6192355001095151 We've been cut off from the world, all alone. Food supplies are dwindling. I'm not even talking about medicine—where are we to get more? \nAnd now our only competent doctor is gone. This winter will be the end of our town.
6192355001095152 We'll survive, just like everyone else does.
6192355001095153 It's not like we're on an island in the middle of the ocean.
6192355001095154 That's exactly how it is.
6192355001095155 Oh, come on…
6192355001095156 Perhaps.
6192355001095157 A train with goods will come eventually.
6192355001095251 Agnia
6192355001095252 The Judge is in his workshop, around the corner. But I can tell you his answer right now: "Yes, you may."
6192355001095253 I may what?
6192355001095255 You may slay the outlaws at night without repercussions. You're the fifth to come and ask about that.
6192355001095256 And why have you come?
6192355001095257 I'm wondering if my man is going to come and ask the same. If he's genuinely planning to kill the killers. If he is, I'm leaving. Today.
6192355001095258 I admire your resolve.
6192355001097351 Tenegh. Foolish boy.
6192355001097352 I know the meaning of the word. Why the harsh words, abgai?
6192355001097751 I hope you're right… But the coming winter will be harsh, mark my words. \nIn times like these, it becomes apparent just how childish we are. So dependent on that umbilical cord, on the noble families. Without them, we're done for. Our town can't stand on its own… It can feed others, but can't support itself.
6192355001097752 That's true.
6192355001097753 We have cows and we have bulls, not to mention stores of meat in the Warehouses.
6192355001097756 There's always room for change. Let the child crawl, and after a couple of head bumps it will be running around.
6192355001097757 When threatened, people tend to get their shit together. Maybe towns are like that too.
6192355001097758 Did you see what's happening on your porch?
6192355001097759 I don't have to look to know, my boy… I can work out the details just fine. The noise is hard to ignore, too. I'm not deaf. All of this does not concern you.
6192355001097760 Why did you shut down the Factory?
6192355001097761 That's where you're wrong. It does concern me. Being a doctor in a town where two thirds of the people are unemployed is…
6192355001097762 Do you have any idea how much I lose after every single day of downtime? If I've stopped the Factory, that means I've had very good reasons for doing so! \nMind your test tubes and surgical instruments, Master Burakh… And keep your nose out of my affairs. I handle my business just as well as you handle yours… You mind that!
6192355001097763 So why do the Kains want my family home?
6192355001097764 Look who's here… Lara says, you were planning a sentimental get-together? Remembering the good old days and all that? As if, what, six years haven't passed?
6192355001097765 Don't suppose we have a time for a get-together now.
6192355001097766 I got the idea before… all this.
6192355001097767 Why so angry though? Yes, I was planning to gather you all. But no one was forcing anyone.
6192355001097768 Well, I guess the sentimental bout with old friends is cancelled. Time to work.
6192355001097769 Drop that sarcasm, will you?
6192355001097770 Is it an either-or thing for you? Work doesn't have to interfere with friendship.
6192355001097771 Are you planning to work days <i>and</i> nights? Right…
6192355001097772 Shee yuunde yereebshe, why are you back? Or do you have the money?
6192355001097773 I do. Hand over the bull.
6192355001097774 I'll bring it to your doorstep.
6192355001097775 I don't live where my father used to.
6192355001097776 The Khatangher know where you live. Sahba-ötün speaks to her people. They need a menkhu, so they need to know how to find you.
6192355001097777 Oh, Sahba… She shouldn't have.
6192355001097778 Nah. I just wanted to take one more look at a talking bull.
6192355001097779 Fair enough. I can't walk around with a bull, after all.
6192355001097780 And please clean it up before you bring it to me.
6192355001097781 Sayn bayna, hello, noukherne! See, I brought your bull. Cleaned it up, too. We Khatanghe never swindle one another.
6192355001097782 Yamar berkhe. Good job!
6192355001097783 I hope it <i>does</i> talk one day. So you say it'll warn me of danger?
6192355001097784 It will, noukherne. You believed me, and for that, you'll be rewarded. Mother Boddho and Suok be my witnesses.
6192355001097785 Don't mention Suok in vain, noukher. It's not a name to say randomly.
6192355001097786 Bayarlaa, khayaala. Thank you. I'll call it "Lucky find."
6192355001097789 Ukherney yereed bayna gyy? Huh? Why are you leaving?
6192355001097790 Go, go. And take the goddamn bull with you.
6192355001097791 The bull told me to. It said, this is my last chance. If I don't leave today, I'll die in four days.\nI believe it.
6192355001097792 …All right, have it your way. I'll buy it.
6192355001097793 Bayarlaa. You won't regret this.
6192355001097794 I hope it <i>does</i> talk one day. So you say it'll warn me of danger?
6192355001097795 Well, I don't. And neither should you. How do you plane to survive alone in the steppe? The winter is at hand.
6192355001097796 All I want is for you to get off my back, nүnekhen zayla!
6192355001097797 You're mistaken, pal. I'm not a worker. I'm a doctor.
6192355001097798 Trying to reach Big Vlad?
6192355001097799 That fat pig refuses to come out. Refuses even an explanation. Bloodsucker.
6192355001097800 What happened?
6192355001097801 Good. We get a lot of workplace accidents. We need a doctor. At least if he's like old Burakh, God rest his soul: Turning his nose at nothing and not trying to swindle three days' payment out of you for a single examination.
6192355001097802 What is this crowd?
6192355001097803 You're a talker. A taskmaster, I suppose?
6192355001097804 Brave words. Would you have the guts to repeat that to his face?
6192355001097805 Enough! We've been silent for too many years, and where did it get us? To the brink of starvation. Our patience runs thin!
6192355001097806 So what happened this time?
6192355001097807 The Factory shut down two days ago, didn't you know? I mean, yeah, there is this soot problem…\nBut when will it run again? How many of us will find themselves on the streets? Will anyone pay us for the downtime, or will the payment be reduced? I can tell you right now it's the latter! And that won't feed my children!
6192355001097808 Yeah…
6192355001097809 We want <i>at least</i> to be told what's going on! Why is the train not coming? Why did he cork up the Termitary? I'll tell you why! They want it all shut down! They're just looking for an excuse to close the Factory!\nThere was no accident, and the toxic soot is a lie, a cover, a crock of shit!
6192355001097810 Perhaps.
6192355001097811 Closing the Bull Enterprise? I don't think so. We produce so much meat… Everyone needs to eat.
6192355001097812 Were you born yesterday, pal? What do you know? People are illiterate here, no fancy schools, but they still think faster than you. The state has one leg in the grave. Things are going downhill so quickly, we can't even end this bloody war.\nIt won't end well…
6192355001097813 It'll be fine.
6192355001097814 Nothing ever ends well.
6192355001097817 Are you going to see the man yourself? Tell him we ain't leaving without an answer. More people will come. We'll stay here for as long as we have to.\nLet the hateful pig tell us the truth.
6192355001097818 All right. I'll tell him.
6192355001097819 But he's the one creating that work in the first place. Isn't he?
6192355001097820 Work… It's serfdom, not work! We're not cattle, we're people! And we deserve to be treated as such!
6192355001097821 And what do you want?
6192355001097822 You go ahead and stay here. Perhaps it will bear fruit.
6192355001097823 Actually, I agree that it doesn't look well. Too many strange things happening. And they all align…
6192355001097824 There have been, indeed, many suspicious coincidences.

6192355001099151 A guest is best when you see them less.
6192355001099152 Is this a bad moment?
6192355001099154 I've got enough on my plate.
6192355001099155 Will you tell me?
6192355001099157 No. Long tongues lead to short lives. If you have a point, get to it; if not, don't let the door hit you on the way out.
6192355001099158 We're getting together this night. The four of us. The old place.
6192355001099159 A murder of crows, huh?
6192355001099160 They sense trouble.
6192355001099161 Well?
6192355001099162 Why are you here?
6192355001099163 I think I should go. I've a lot of work to do.
6192355001099164 I didn't expect you to come.
6192355001099751 Work.
6192355001099752 What kind of work can you possibly be doing at this place?
6192355001099753 Moonlighting as an architect? Or a philosopher, perhaps?
6192355001099754 I'll have you know this house is in mourning, too. Simon Kain died the same night as my mentor. And I am a pathoanatomist, if you didn't know. It's my main area of expertise.
6192355001099755 I didn't. How was I to know?
6192355001100651 It roughly translates as "the most reasonable and friendly."
6192355001100652 Forget Stakh. I see now that I'm one step away from falling out with <i>you.</i> Why?
6192355001100653 I'm sorry. Forget it.\nIt's just that sometimes you feel, all too poignantly, that your life is over. You're not even thirty, but you're done. Not dead, but burnt through… and there's nothing ahead for you.
6192355001100654 But what does it have to do with me?
6192355001100655 Nothing. Not now, anyway. It's just… it could have gone differently.
6192355001100656 Yes. It could have.
6192355001100657 That's all right. It won't take you two even a year to reconcile. Like you have a choice…
6192355001100658 That's some strategic thinking. Measuring life in years.
6192355001100659 A year more, a year less… I may even live to be a hundred years old. So what?
6192355001100660 What's wrong with you, Lara?
6192355001100661 …Perhaps the four of us should meet today? Even Bad Grief? Like the good old days.
6192355001100662 Then again… Indeed… You're right. Let's do it. The four of us. Grief included. Today. The old place—the Apple Road, right? By midnight, as usual?
6192355001100663 Precisely. The Apple Road, by the Basket.
6192355001100664 …All I wanted was to see if you were okay. See you, Lara.
6192355001100665 Yes. The night will be clear.
6192355001100666 I mean, it's better than your place… It's too gloomy here.
6192355001100667 Grief? You've no idea what quagmire Grief has gotten himself in… And Stakh? He's also done something awful… The Judge is angry at him. He summoned him to the Crucible for questioning! He's still here—what does that even mean, huh?\nOh, the three of you deserve each other!
6192355001100668 Let's gather together, huh? The four of us? I mean it. I'll arrange everything.
6192355001100676 I'm overjoyed to see you too.
6192355001100677 You're a… what? Where did you even learn that?
6192355001100678 Your father. And I'd obviously prefer if the Kin didn't know that. They've had it for me for a while now.
6192355001100679 What for?
6192355001100680 Forget it. Are you here about Simon's body as well? You're a bit late—I performed the autopsy on the same day. And on the next day the body went missing.
6192355001100681 The hell? Was it stolen? By whom? And what for?
6192355001100682 Whoa… You're in big trouble, friend.
6192355001100683 Maybe the two of us should go looking for it.
6192355001100684 I've already convinced the Judge that it wasn't my fault. I am, after all, a pathoanatomist, not a guard. \nThe Kains have enough people. They'll find it. So it's not our problem anymore.
6192355001100685 Anyway, I actually came here looking for you.
6192355001100686 Why?
6192355001100687 We want to gather this evening. At the old place.
6192355001100688 Then why are you here?
6192355001100689 Maria, the Kains' daughter, wanted to talk. And when she wants something, you don't argue. She took after Nina, if you know what I mean. Maria probably wants to discuss Simon… So here I wait.
6192355001100690 Got it. By the way, I came here looking for you.
6192355001100691 By the Basket?
6192355001100692 Yes, by the Basket.
6192355001100693 Touching. Bad Grief included?
6192355001100694 Yes. He is.
6192355001100695 We'll see who comes.
6192355001100696 Why do you have to be so cranky? Go swim in the Gorkhon! Perhaps it'll cool your head!
6192355001100697 Heard you loud and clear. And now excuse me, but I need to prepare for a tough conversation.\nJust… wait a second. Tell me: Reconciling everyone was, of course, Lara's idea?
6192355001100698 Why do you care? See you. Good luck with Kaina.
6192355001100699 Yes, it was Lara's.
6192355001100700 Grief is the one who's truly hurt. It was ugly of you two to turn away from him.
6192355001100701 No, Stakh. It was mine.
6192355001100702 Oh, I'm sorry. <i>Clearly</i> you're terribly busy here.
6192355001100703 What's wrong with everyone today? Are you trying to drive me nuts?
6192355001100704 Indeed, I <i>am</i> busy. Business doesn't make itself, oh, someone spins the gears.
6192355001100705 What's wrong?
6192355001100706 Yeah? Well, to hell with you!
6192355001100708 Huh? Why all of a sudden?
6192355001100709 Well, we haven't seen each other in a while.
6192355001100710 Because it's time we stopped bickering.
6192355001100711 We can mend our old friendship. I'm sure we can.
6192355001100712 The old place, as in by the Gumstone? At the railroad?
6192355001100713 Yes. Next to the Basket.
6192355001100714 Yes. The Apple Road, remember?
6192355001100715 …Go ahead. The three of you will have more fun without me.
6192355001100716 No, we won't.
6192355001100717 Me and Stakh are at each other's throats, too. He can barely stand me. Blames me for Father's death.
6192355001100718 Wow. What tree did he fall from to hurt his head so? Must have been that new tower.
6192355001100719 Precisely…
6192355001100720 Well, he's right, in a way. I can't stop thinking about it.
6192355001100721 I don't know, Cub… I've got a full plate here. Those men, the night hunters, they're too fond of playin' with knives. Way too fond… Where'd they all even come from?
6192355001100722 The ones cutting people?
6192355001100723 It's not just your plate. It's everyone's, now.
6192355001100724 Not my fault. But… somehow, it is. Never took blood, but I dressed for a red harvest. How it bloomed…\nForget it. I'll deal with it myself.
6192355001100725 Just come to our old place. Did you hear me? Please come. No one will blame you.
6192355001100726 So, take this chance to explain it to Stakh and Lara… and me.
6192355001100727 We'll figure it out together. I won't abandon you.
6192355001100728 There weren't so many crows in town before, were there?
6192355001100729 Listen. Do you want to talk about the merry knife men? The night hunters.
6192355001100730 Huh?
6192355001100731 What will you do with the cutthroats?
6192355001100732 What can I even do? Pretend I'm still their leader to their face, then disown 'em around polite society? Already on it. What else is there?
6192355001100733 I think you need to pick a side.
6192355001100734 It's too late for me, Cub. I've only got one road ahead of me now.\nPerhaps the outbreak is for the best… Plagues are like fires, people forget old scores. And all hell will break loose here soon.
6192355001100735 Any dark prophecies to share? You're the criminal mastermind here, after all.
6192355001100736 So the outbreak makes you happy, huh?
6192355001100737 No need to prophesize. People fear hunger. Even honest workers will turn their hatchets and hammers to crime. Burglin' houses, lootin' corpses, guttin' each other.\nThey will. <i>Oh, they will.</i>
6192355001100738 Not all of them, Grief. Not all.
6192355001100739 Nope. It was all sparrows before. And larks. And a fair share of starlings.
6192355001100740 Where did they all go to, I wonder? It's all crows now…
6192355001100741 Heed my wisdom: We're all in for it. It only took them as little as yesterday to start cuttin' folks… Means they'll soon go completely an' absolutely off their rocker.\nPeople get used to death all too quick.
6192355001100743 Bite your tongue.
6192355001100744 So what will you say to your thugs, then?
6192355001100745 They're no longer mine, Cub. Mine are all at my side. Although… hell, why pretend? Not all of them. Not all of them are mine anymore.\n…And then there were none.
6192355001100746 What are you planning to do?
6192355001100747 It's up to you, pal. But you won't last long, not this way.
6192355001100748 We'll see.
6192355001100749 The turf's so dry, you don't even need a match—a glare would start a fire.\nAnd when the Kin bares its teeth, that's when we'll all dance! They're slow on the start, but oh so fast on the draw! The Master likes them mute and obedient, but apathy makes them that way, not stupidity. They're only obedient till the time comes.\nAnd here it comes.
6192355001100750 Big words…
6192355001101751 Kids are hiding in this yard. I should go seek them out.
6192355001102151 Murmuring can be heard from this house.
6192355001102152 I'm afraid your father… might be aware.
6192355001102153 ...With your kind help, I take it?
6192355001102154 It's not my fault you share the same name!
6192355001102155 Is it really that bad?
6192355001102156 "V. O."... Vlad Olgimsky?
6192355001102157 "V. O."... Vlad Olgimsky?
6192355001102158 "V. O."... Vlad Olgimsky?
6192355001102159 The cemetery is crowded. I suspect these people came to bury Father.
6192355001102160 Bad Grief doesn't seem interested in old friendship. His loss! I'm not going to play mother hen, rounding them all up.
6192355001103251 …Scared, aren't you, brother?
6192355001103252 You're right.
6192355001103253 And the people who lose their jobs? They won't be too fond of staying home. They'll find new hobbies, like looking for food, or venting their anger.\n…And Fat Vlad shut his facilities down the day before yesterday, didn't he? Crafty… Didn't whisper so much as a single word to me. Do you think he knew?
6192355001103254 Who knows…
6192355001103255 No, I doubt it.
6192355001103256 I think he might have suspected. Perhaps that's why he locked the Termitary, to protect the workers.
6192355001103257 If it's the same sand pest we saw five years ago, we're all finished. There was no salvation from it. Every single person in the Crude Sprawl died. \nYour father was fast enough to lock the doors back then, so it died there. Only reason we're still alive. Now we can't even lock the gate… an' there's no one to lock it, either.
6192355001103259 He made a hard choice. Perhaps if he had more time, he could've found a better solution…
6192355001103260 Oh, stop whining. I promise you'll be all right.
6192355001103261 Thanks for sharing your opinion. Now shove it up your ass.
6192355001103262 Calm down.
6192355001103263 Neither did I. But I don't regret it. I've regained my strength a bit. This place… It's good. I've already forgotten what the steppe is like.
6192355001103264 What's that train car over there? I don't remember it before.
6192355001103265 Damned if I know… I think someone lives there. A kid, maybe. I saw a ball there in the rails. Kids often gather around these parts. Not everyone is fond of that Polyhedron. Not everyone fits there.
6192355001103266 You've got a keen eye, noticing a ball in this dark.
6192355001103267 Not everyone fits? You mean they're filtering someone out?
6192355001103268 I don't know. I've no idea how to deal with children. Never had.
6192355001103269 Even when you were one yourself.
6192355001103270 Same here.
6192355001103271 Why yes, I can't complain. I do have a good eye.
6192355001103272 …Looking the wrong way, unfortunately.
6192355001103273 …Ugh. Forget it. Enough idle chatter. Yes, I am angry with you. And you ought to understand why.
6192355001103274 You said the Kin were after you. Do they have a good reason?
6192355001103275 Your kind doesn't take kindly to cutting bodies. And cutting bodies is my job.\nMy mentor… I mean, your father… You know what he meant for the Kin. He did have that right, kind of, but still… I was the one they demonized. And that's fine. I don't mind.
6192355001103276 Oh… I'm beginning to understand now.
6192355001103277 But how did Father allow it?
6192355001103278 And who would herd your kind, otherwise? Fat Vlad? Your elders?\nHe had a hard job. And he did operate, when he absolutely had to. But bodies require autopsy. You know it as well as I. Pathoanatomy is the foundation of our art. A science.
6192355001103279 You truly were a loyal apprentice to him.
6192355001103280 It's not anger, pal. It's jealousy. Let go of it, will you? It's ridiculous.
6192355001103281 So you don't venture into the steppe often?
6192355001103282 I'm unwelcome here. Your kind is better left alone. They don't appreciate my company.
6192355001103283 Huh. I don't remember you ever being afraid of anyone that much.
6192355001103284 So you see me as part of the Kin, now? Does that make it easier to hate me?
6192355001103285 You know… Perhaps you're right. You're anything but stupid, Cub. You've always been a good judge of character. For all the good that's done anyone…
6192355001103286 What do you mean?
6192355001103287 Go, Stakh. Go. Make us all feel ashamed.
6192355001103288 Fine. It's not my place to judge you. And neither is it yours to judge me.
6192355001103289 So you dig up dead Khatanghe from down below? Not a brilliant move…
6192355001103290 No one came.
6192355001103291 We did. Isn't that enough?
6192355001103292 I expected as much. The gatherings of old friends seem inappropriate now…
6192355001103293 Isn't it obvious? Any old grudges pale in comparison to this sort of catastrophe.
6192355001103294 Tragedies like this bring people together. Ought to, anyway. So it did to us…
6192355001103295 I feel like this plague will become a great weaver, mending that which was broken.
6192355001103296 I disagree. The outbreak will sow discord. It will tear apart friends, families…\nIt wasn't the plague that got us together. It was you.
6192355001103297 You don't have to.
6192355001103298 If not for the plague, no one would change their mind.
6192355001103299 No. It was all you. Your will.\nYou've done really well, Cub. You swallowed your pride and the wrongs done to you… You weren't ashamed to vouch for Grief. I don't think I could've done the same.
6192355001103300 Come on… You were always the thread that held us together.
6192355001103301 About what is in store for us all?
6192355001103302 No. About each other.
6192355001103303 Well, that's good to hear. I hoped you would. Did the three of you make peace?
6192355001103304 The last hug before the flood comes?
6192355001103305 We'll protect each other. And we'll try to survive. Yes?
6192355001103306 Of course.
6192355001103307 What do you know of this disease? They're calling it "sand pest." You know why?
6192355001103308 Why "sand"?
6192355001103309 Because it makes your skin dry like sand. People still believe it came from below the ground. All those fairy tales of an earthen golem, a clay-legged shabnak… You know…
6192355001103310 Nonsense.
6192355001103311 I know nothing, except that there was an outbreak before.
6192355001103312 What about your father? Has he maybe left any notes…?
6192355001103313 Three scribbled pages, some drawings on the walls… No. Nothing.
6192355001103314 It mowed down everyone in that poor district last time. No survivors. Every single person got infected, every single person died. Does this mean there's no hope?
6192355001103315 Perhaps there isn't. So what? The most important things inside us need not rely on hope.
6192355001103316 I hope you don't mean the internal organs.
6192355001103317 It's good that you still have the sense of humor.
6192355001103318 We'll try. By the way… do you know why all the Stations were shut down? Both the Cargo and the Passenger Stations. Has it been long?
6192355001103319 The Passenger Station was shut down a year ago. Cargo, only recently. In the summer. \nThere was some sort of a renewal project… Remember how enthusiastic they were about building new railroads before the war? …Were you also there, on the front?
6192355001103320 Served as a medic for a while. Nothing interesting.
6192355001103321 No, of course I wasn't. I'd make a terrible soldier…
6192355001103323 <i>Of course</i> I mean the organs. Like there's anything else I could be talking about…
6192355001103324 Hope is the only thing that stands between us and ending it all every evening.
6192355001103325 I prefer not to think about it. I need to concentrate on my work. What is to come, will come.
6192355001104551 Sticky
6192355001104552 So, I cleaned our place up. I burned the trash, took away the bones—I mean, the cracked ones, and I put that weird grey goo from the table in a bucket. Might be useful, right?
6192355001104553 "Our place"? Did I hear you right?
6192355001104554 Just who the hell do you think you are?
6192355001104555 No rest for the wicked, huh?
6192355001104556 I can also whip up something for us to eat. Got any money?
6192355001104557 You whippersnapper… What am I supposed to do with you?
6192355001104558 Don't you dare.
6192355001104559 No money for you. I'll go home and make everything myself.
6192355001104560 Anyway, when are you coming back? Should I wait for you or what? Someone's gotta take care of your dad's stuff, and… stuff. I think it would be great if we did it together.
6192355001104561 No. No no no. No "together." Didn't I tell you not to touch anything?
6192355001104562 Why do you care anyway?
6192355001104563 By the way, I, uh… broke a pipe over there. I don't think it was important though. So don't hit me, all right? I'll fix it myself.\nBoar has a pipe like that. I bet he'll trade it for a bottle of alcohol. We have a couple of those, right?
6192355001104564 No trading anything!
6192355001104565 No fixing anything!
6192355001104566 Just… just stay here and don't go anywhere. Don't even move. Got it?
6192355001104567 Got it.
6192355001104568 Good, kiddo. Great. Keep it up.
6192355001106016 Don't worry, pal. Crows have the right to be devout too.
6192355001106017 For the Kains, every building is a machine, making something for humans… or with them. For example, this Cathedral has nothing to do with religion. There is a grim joke circulating around, claiming that the Cathedral makes time.
6192355001106018 Makes time for what?
6192355001106019 Do the Kains mean it for real?
6192355001106020 Yeah, I've heard.
6192355001106021 Just <i>makes it.</i> Produces it.\nThe Kains lay out their buildings in such a way that they change the perception and worldview of those inside them.\nI guess Simon wanted people feel the flow of time differently inside the Cathedral, so that's how he planned the building… But then rumors simplified the idea.
6192355001106022 All right. But how are crows at fault?
6192355001106023 Funny.
6192355001106024 They slow time down. The Kains rush it ahead, they refuse to sit on their hands. Complacency and laziness are the worst sins in their book. Slow time is tantamount to death for them…\nBut those are just silly rumors.
6192355001106025 I, on the other hand, don't like being rushed.
6192355001106026 It's not just the Kains. I like it when time itself hurries me up.
6192355001106027 I don't notice them either. Even the cawing has become a background noise, like a sea splashing.
6192355001106028 A real one. Crows are harbingers of death. Whoever doesn't notice crows, will die soon.\nWe've been standing here for a while. Many many many people passed us by… The three of us were the only ones who stopped to look.
6192355001106029 The four of us.
6192355001106030 The three. There are three of us. Oh… Yes. Four.
6192355001106031 Seems like you're behind on your arithmetic. Study better.
6192355001106032 Whichever you prefer. Three is fine by me.
6192355001106033 That's ominous.
6192355001106034 How fares your kine, khayaala. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.
6192355001106035 With us, Khatanghe, all omens seem to be death omens. And no one cares! I don't think I've ever met a people so indifferent.
6192355001106036 Beautiful indeed! Yamar goe bee! Still, as an omen, it's bad.
6192355001106037 Why?
6192355001106038 When crows are numerous, they're waiting for carrion. And what can we give them? Our bodies feed Mother Boddho, the Earth. Why feed crows? Aydahamne khүrene, that would be like giving yourself to the sky. \nYou know it's a bad way to go. And so the omen is ill.
6192355001106039 Tenegh! Bite your tongue! You don't know what you're saying.
6192355001106040 Evils always passed us by, and so it will now. Bayartay, khayaala.
6192355001106041 Let them wait. They'll get nothing.
6192355001106042 They, uh… I believe they already gave you the key to the lair where the Old Man had worked. Does it… does it mean I have to leave? Can I stay, maybe?
6192355001106043 Did you live there?
6192355001106044 No… It's my workplace.
6192355001106045 Right.
6192355001106046 Yeah. You have to leave.
6192355001106047 …Old man, can I stay? I want to be a doctor. I'll help you! I'll work!
6192355001106048 Some worker you are…
6192355001107351 Can I please stay? Pretty please with sugar on top!
6192355001107352 I have a sugar intolerance. But I'll think about it.
6192355001107353 Fine, we'll manage together… I can't just throw you out, can I?
6192355001107354 No. I don't need one more burden. I have enough responsibilities as it is.
6192355001107355 Me? A burden? You're a burden! I've never been one! I've known how to get around since I was a tiny kid! I'm an orphan, got it?
6192355001107356 An orphan? I see. So here we are now, two orphans.
6192355001107357 No means no.
6192355001107358 Who are you?
6192355001107359 They call me Sticky. I've no idea why.
6192355001107360 Why don't you live home?
6192355001107361 I don't have a home. I'm an orphan.
6192355001107362 So you stayed at my father's workshop?
6192355001107363 You know what? Go to the Shelter. It's a house by the river in the Flank. Lara Ravel lives there, she'll take you in.
6192355001107364 Who are you calling old?
6192355001107365 Just don't hit me, okay? Well… you can, but only for a good reason. Deal?
6192355001107366 Who are we operating on today, doctor?
6192355001107367 Persistent, aren't you? Sticking like a leech…
6192355001107368 I don't hit children. So don't hit me either… or I might break.
6192355001107369 Says who?
6192355001107370 Is that how you were taught to heal people? Be khara, you just got lucky. Anyone can administer a remedy someone else made. A child might pick medicine by pretty colors! Be oylgono ugyb, this is not your father's way!
6192355001107371 Boleesh, boleesh, bүү alysh… You're right to shame me. This will not happen again. I will learn.
6192355001107372 Maybe my way is different from my father's. It's up to me to decide, khetey!
6192355001107373 You're not planning on giving it to Patches, right? It might kill him, you know.
6192355001107374 You think I'm insane? It's not medicine, just a thing kids play with.
6192355001107375 How do you know?
6192355001107376 I can sense that foul stench a mile away.
6192355001107377 You got me, I've got a shmowder. What now?
6192355001107378 I'm not. I'll treat him with normal medicine.
6192355001107379 Calm down. I believe you.
6192355001107380 Not to mention they're terrible for your health! You know the only time people eat a pile of random pills? When they want to kill themselves! You don't even know what it's made of.\nLeave the boy alone. If you're so keen on poisoning someone, eat it yourself.
6192355001107381 Calm the hell down.
6192355001107382 Not now. But perhaps one day I will test one on myself.
6192355001107383 Trust me, please. We have time, at least until seven. Go and prepare the right medicine. \nIt's not like I know anything about your father's craft. It's just that I feel that you need to do as he did. To do otherwise will invite great sorrow.
6192355001107384 There's no time. I'll have to guess. By the way, why are you even here?
6192355001107385 How do you know?
6192355001107386 I have a gift for seeing things.
6192355001107387 You're weird, you know that? And yet, somehow, this once, I genuinely want to trust you.
6192355001107391 …Notkin wouldn't let me.
6192355001107392 I wonder why…
6192355001107393 Why, I wonder?
6192355001107396 I wanted to help.
6192355001107397 Why didn't you, then?
6192355001107398 They don't believe in me. They don't believe I'm a miracle worker… As they have believed, so shall it be done for them. But then why should the boy suffer?
6192355001107399 He shouldn't.
6192355001107400 I'll take care of him myself. Maybe something will come of it.
6192355001107401 I wouldn't trust you with my life either.
6192355001107402 How about you just… don't? You'll only make it worse. You… what'll you do, cut his heart out? Ripper…
6192355001107403 No. I have another idea.
6192355001107404 I'll do it my father's way. He could cure without cutting.
6192355001107405 I'd rather cut out yours. I'm curious about it.
6192355001107406 "We have time"? Can't you help him now? Don't you have healing hands, or something? 
6192355001107407 All right, I'm convinced. Sit tight, I'll be back soon.
6192355001109553 Are you well yourself? You must be dead tired.
6192355001109554 It's not like you to care about my well-being.
6192355001109555 Do you think I'm out to cheat or swindle you? You hate me. Everyone hates me. It's okay, I'm used to being hated… but that doesn't make me the villain. \nTrust your heart, not your head. What do you think of me?
6192355001109556 Nah, I don't hate you. You have a good heart, I think.
6192355001109558 I'm not going to lie—I could use some rest.
6192355001109559 You gotta stay awake until nightfall. Today is very, very, very important. It's going to be hard to stay awake, but you can make it. Coffee staves off sleep. Want some?
6192355001109560 A gift? From you? You must be joking.
6192355001109561 Sure.
6192355001109562 You're trying to swindle me right now.
6192355001109563 How do I put it… You're weird. Suspicious. And always different.
6192355001109564 Thanks, sister.
6192355001109565 The Judge sure puts a lot of trust in the townsfolk.
6192355001109566 If somebody you know is planning to murder a person, even a villain… then there's something wrong with them. And I've seen a few red flags already…
6192355001109567 Be careful at night. There's no guarantee your boyfriend doesn't join the outlaws instead.
6192355001109568 He's probably just trying to protect you.
6192355001109569 Thanks a lot. Now I'm feeling ashamed of myself.
6192355001109570 Enough chitchat. To the left, around the corner?
6192355001109613 By the way, what is this strange… mold, I guess? Is it mold? That thing your house is covered in? Do houses get scabs around these parts?
6192355001109614 I don't know. Never seen these before.
6192355001109615 And by the way, what is this strange… mold, I guess? Is it mold? That thing your house is covered in? Do houses often get scabs around these parts?
6192355001109616 I don't know. Never seen these before.
6192355001109617 What mold? What on earth are you talking about?
6192355001109618 They're lentigines. I've seen stranger things around here.
6192355001109619 What mold? What on earth are you talking about?
6192355001109620 They're lentigines. I've seen stranger things around here.

6192355001118151 
6192355001120651 What are you doing here?
6192355001120652 I… got here by accident. Lost my way.
6192355001120653 Out. Now.
6192355001120654 How rude.
6192355001120655 Who are you?
6192355001120656 What are you doing here?
6192355001120657 One more word from you and everything will break. I told you to get lost. Are you stupid?
6192355001120658 No, I hear you loud and clear.
6192355001120659 Just wondering how you survived this long with manners like those.
6192355001120660 Dividing power. You're not required.
6192355001120661 Mind your manners, girl.
6192355001120662 Who knows…
6192355001120663 Maria Kaina
6192355001121051 Even in a handcrafted town like this, there is an underground, a rat's nest. At odds with the law. At odds with good morals. People come to them with dubious challenges and requests.
6192355001121052 Just say it out loud: They're thieves.
6192355001121053 Who are you?
6192355001121054 A Reflection. Call me his conscience, if you will.
6192355001121055 Grief's?
6192355001121056 I always knew Bad Grief's conscience was somewhere around… Yet still separate from the guy himself.
6192355001121057 You know my master. He is your friend, and he hasn't changed much since you last saw him. He always loved to live on the edge. Never was a stickler for rules.\nBut he was never truly vile or cruel.
6192355001121058 Yet he <i>has</i> changed.
6192355001121059 And here I thought…
6192355001121060 He wants to seem a kingpin, a king; a local tzar of his own small turf. Wants to <i>seem,</i> not <i>be.</i> Play a big wheeler-dealer.\nBut that's not who he really is. He's just…
6192355001121061 …Playing pretend? Don't make me laugh.
6192355001121062 Thieves and rats never tolerate false leaders. Are you telling me they're all just playing war here?
6192355001121063 He's worried that blood started to spill now. And it was probably spilled by his men. The people who rubbed shoulders with him, hiding their teeth at first…\nHe's worried you'll think he has it all under control, meaning today's craze is his doing.
6192355001121064 Isn't it?
6192355001121065 How do you know he even has a conscience?
6192355001121066 Such is our town. You know it yourself: It's a very good village. Beautiful people live here, infusing it with a very spiritual dream. There's no real, villainous crime here. Even the rats and the thieves are softer.
6192355001121067 Yeah, right…
6192355001121068 Dreams live in the Upper Town, not here. Closer to the Bridge Square…
6192355001121069 I am his Reflection. Who else is to know what his heart is worried about?
6192355001121070 Touching.
6192355001121071 Perhaps he is partially responsible. Perhaps he did corrupt them with his talk of how any law is but chains that one must break in order to become free and truly human…\nBut he never wanted bloodshed. Keep that in mind.
6192355001121072 Thanks, Reflection. That's comforting to know.
6192355001121073 So the fellow bit off more than he can chew. We'll see where it leads.
6192355001121074 Would you like to know what your old friend is truly worried about now? He's playing a dashing scoundrel in front of you, but his soul is trembling.
6192355001121075 Well, why?
6192355001121076 His soul has very good reasons to tremble. Don't bother going into detail.
6192355001130651 
6192355001130652 
6192355001131351 Time to get the hell away from here, right?
6192355001131352 Indeed. Follow me.
6192355001131353 Well, you can stay if you wish.
6192355001131751 When did you…? Was it that House of Death thing?
6192355001131752 The driver of the train I arrived by.
6192355001131753 Yeah? And what did he look like?
6192355001131754 Like… a normal person.
6192355001131755 Ordinary height. Ordinary complexion. Looks like a worker, maybe.
6192355001131756 …Like a good third of the Town's men. Damn it.
6192355001131757 So how do we look for him, I wonder? The normal, ordinary one?
6192355001131758 …Damn it.
6192355001131761 Why not the Town Hall, though? Then again… it doesn't matter.
6192355001131762 The local authorities seem to have promised all doctors payment from a public Fund.
6192355001131763 I took my Fund reward. The next payment is no sooner than tomorrow.
6192355001131764 The Fund has a reward for me.
6192355001131765 The Fund has nothing for me today.

6192355001131787 I don't even <i>have</i> a doorstep.
6192355001131788 Then I'll bring it to you when you find one.
6192355001131789 How will you know where I'll find a place? From the bull, too?
6192355001131790 <i>If</i> I find one.

6192355001134054 
6192355001134055 The door locked behind us. According to the legend, I need to inspect the house and light up all candles I can find. Or wait until dawn.
6192355001134056 The door opened up. Whatever it was, it's gone now. Now I need to grab the boys and leave this place.
6192355001134057 
6192355001134058 
6192355001134059 
6192355001134060 …Scared? I'm just estimating how they're gonna look. Don't you worry, for now… For now, they're still right as rain. But the countdown has started, so to speak.\nThey're the most <i>delicious</i> piece to me… The most interesting morsels.
6192355001134061 What do you want?
6192355001134062 Shut up. And put this away!
6192355001134063 Oh, I'm more about putting things <i>under</i>. So, sorry if I can't oblige… Will you forgive me? Oh, pretty, pretty please?
6192355001134064 Just get lost.
6192355001134065 Who are you?
6192355001134066 I only want to play hide-and-seek. I am, after all, playing with you all. Hide-and-seek, tag. Dice. Tic-tac-toe. Love my x's and o's… So keep in mind: Ready or not, here I come.
6192355001134067 They're from a list I got from my father. I won't let you have them.
6192355001134068 Where's the Eighth?
6192355001134069 The Eighth will be a hassle. But I think I'll manage, in nine days or so. Maybe faster. Who knows.
6192355001134070 Get lost.
6192355001134071 I'll be faster.
6192355001134073 Orderly
6192355001134074 What once was a theatre of comedy is now an anatomy theatre. 
6192355001134075 It was a theatre of tragedy.
6192355001134751 So, what do we do?
6192355001134752 I… don't know. I guess we can try lighting candles, like in that urban legend of yours.
6192355001134753 Each day will bring new jobs. For you and for us.\nYou work here in the hospital; we crawl around houses looking for corpses. God knows which is worse…
6192355001134754 So you're an orderly?
6192355001134755 So I am. At least while I'm wearing these rags. Such are our orders.
6192355001134756 Looks gorgeous.
6192355001134757 Do these costumes really offer protection?
6192355001134758 Doesn't your work require… hands?
6192355001134759 I guess. \nI don't envy you, working with the doomed and dead. But you will have <i>some</i> support.\nThere, deep on the stage, to the left of you—is a closet, see? You'll find medicine inside. Replenished every day. You're free to grab and use it.
6192355001134760 Every day? Sounds good.
6192355001134761 God, the smell here…
6192355001134762 Your work is worse.
6192355001134763 Nothing is worse than hospitals, not to mention theatres.
6192355001134764 They're not doomed yet.
6192355001135251 Someone is selling a revolver over here. Three thousand. He won't wait forever, though.
6192355001135254 
6192355001135255 
6192355001135256 There is an unusual contraption here. It's out of order. I'll need two chunks of metal scrap and two springs to fix it.
6192355001135257 
6192355001135258 
6192355001135259 Father's contraption is out of order. I'll need a chunk of metal scrap and a good spring to fix it.
6192355001135260 
6192355001135261 
6192355001135262 The contraption in the den can be used to produce herbal infusions and tinctures.
6192355001135263 
6192355001135264 
6192355001135265 The contraption in the den can be used to produce herbal infusions and tinctures.
6192355001135266 Someone owes Sticky a toolkit. Timely!
6192355001135267 You're one smooth talker! Almost got entranced myself. When you told him about that bush in the man's guts… Will you tell me more? I didn't catch everything through the wall.
6192355001135268 I know a lot of anecdotes, all right.
6192355001137251 Got it, Worm.
6192355001140953 There's no point in sending him kind regards anymore, Nightjar. He's dead.
6192355001140954 It hurts… but it's different now. What did you give me?
6192355001140955 That insane mixture of yours, made from various pills.
6192355001140956 Where does it hurt now?
6192355001140957 A shmowder? Are you nuts? Why did you waste it on me?
6192355001140958 Who else?
6192355001140962 In the stomach. It burns. But not the way it did before.\nI was sick with that new disease, I know. What did you give me?
6192355001140963 A shmowder.
6192355001140964 They can be… kinda lethal, by the way. If you're weak.
6192355001140965 But you're alive.
6192355001140966 I didn't have anything else to give you. And no time, either.
6192355001140967 Is this your idea of gratitude?
6192355001140968 No. Sorry. I mean… Thanks.
6192355001140969 That's better.
6192355001140970 You're welcome. Although, to be fair, I didn't do much.
6192355001140971 Think you have saved him? You cheat! Only got him a brief break from death.\nIt did not keep me at bay forever. And so I will return to him, again and again, and you shall not have such wild potions with you. Little remains.
6192355001140972 What do you want?
6192355001140973 I'm not in the habit of speaking to hallucinations.
6192355001140974 Ugh, this thing again… Maybe I caught the disease from the boy?
6192355001140975 I was looking for Rubin. He's upstairs, waiting for you.
6192355001140976 I was looking for the Judge.
6192355001140977 No one enters this house uninvited. Get lost. And do not return unless summoned.
6192355001140978 Will you ever summon me…?
6192355001140979 Don't get cheeky with me, girl. I'm not…
6192355001141151 
6192355001141152

6192355001141155 
6192355001141156 
6192355001141157 I'll never leave this place, even if just to visit someone. Mother never traveled, either.\nDo you think that's awful? Sometimes I recall that the wider world is vastly different than our corner—and yet I know nothing of it.
6192355001141158 Well, it does limit you. I only came into my own after I left.

6192355001141172 COLD\nICY—COLD\nI—SEE—COLD\nALL CALLED\nALL
6192355001141173 …You really can talk?
6192355001141174 I don't know how to care for him…
6192355001141175 Yeah… he's not dead.
6192355001141176 See? I've got a second daughter now. The first one is over there, by the Gorkhon… and the second is here, by my side.\nUmm… Any idea what they eat?
6192355001141180 Grace has moved to Peter Stamatin's place. Who would have guessed…
6192355001141181 All right. I'll drop by your place some time later to talk about the Kin.
6192355001141182 And what the fuck do you want, Artemy the Uninvited?
6192355001141183 Just dropping by.
6192355001141184 Watch your tongue, old man. I did nothing to provoke this attack.
6192355001145651 Someone is willing to help me out with equipment.
6192355001147251 Glad to see you in good health.
6192355001147252 Likewise. I was wondering about Grace. Have you found her a new home?
6192355001147253 Are you with a child?
6192355001147254 I… what? No!
6192355001147255 I can hear a baby crying.
6192355001147256 Well… Fair enough. I'll still carry the baby, but I'll let the people in the Town Hall know you were the one who found it.
6192355001147451 
6192355001147452 
6192355001147453

6192355001149053 Whoever rescues a baby from an infected district and brings it to the Town Hall will be rewarded.
6192355001149055 …You're a hero, you know that? How did you find it? Is it healthy?
6192355001149056 I'm not sure, I'm not a pediatrician. It seems quiet and content though.
6192355001149057 All right, I can see you desperately need redemption. Take the baby. Go on, save your soul.
6192355001149058 Wait. Give me a moment to think.
6192355001149551 ....
6192355001149552 So, got anything to say?
6192355001150451 To hell with it. Now is not the time to get misty-eyed with old friends.
6192355001151690 It's not like he created all that on his own.
6192355001151691 No two people in the world had more differences than your father and Simon. They couldn't agree on anything, but got very close. Even though they should've been rivals—maybe even enemies. Like Notkin and I.
6192355001151692 You don't look like enemies.
6192355001151693 I'm sorry about your loss, Caspar.
6192355001151694 Excuse me, but why in the world should you care? I don't understand why you find it appropriate to pry into our affairs.
6192355001151695 I do care.
6192355001151696 You're in an odd place at an odd time. I suspect you're up to no good.
6192355001151697 Sounds serious.
6192355001151698 "Negotiate." A big word.
6192355001151699 What are you doing in this pub?
6192355001151700 Since you came here anyway, at least stay here, all right? Indoors.
6192355001151701 I care about everything these days. Such is a doctor's job in the days of an outbreak.
6192355001151728 Fancy meeting you here.
6192355001151729 Am I disturbing you?
6192355001151730 The hypothesis. The theory. The idea. Was I not sufficiently clear? It needs testing.\nIf Notkin stops playing the fool and sends his Soul-and-a-Halves to search, maybe we can even do it tonight.
6192355001151731 Will you take me with you?
6192355001151732 Elaborate.
6192355001151733 Huh, so you came here too? That's lucky. Something does feel off. I think there's someone else here beside us.
6192355001151734 Who?
6192355001151735 Yes, a legion of microbes. If we don't get infected, consider us born once again tonight...
6192355001151736 Well, I guess someone lives here. Or used to.
6192355001151737 Perhaps it <i>is</i> Death himself. I never would have said this before, but… everything happens.
6192355001151738 Come now… Perhaps some drifter just got in.
6192355001151739 Stay here. I'll come back to you after I check.
6192355001151740 There's no one here but us.
6192355001151741 Your friend only talks to me through clenched teeth. Perhaps you trust me more?
6192355001151742 No, I'm content. As you can see, Khan has deigned to ask us for help. That's almost like admitting he's wrong. I'd never ask him for anything, however badly we needed it. Pride is more important.\nWe can live without him. He can't live without us. As they say, <i>Q.E.D.</i>
6192355001151743 Is he your friend?
6192355001151744 Perhaps I do.
6192355001151745 I did help you with that trial of yours, remember?
6192355001151749 You seemed to agree with the way I resolved that issue with… Lika, I believe was the name?
6192355001151750 By the way, I did find myself a Half. Can you imagine who it is?
6192355001152651 She should not. But neither is it wise to let her take the baby. Go ahead, basaghan, take it to the Town Hall.
6192355001152652 No one ever believes me… I could turn myself inside out, and still, no one ever would! \nI genuinely wanted to do good… Then she came along, and then you! Am I cursed, truly? Fate… It must be fate…
6192355001152653 Leave fate out of this.
6192355001152654 What have you done, yargachin… You've ruined a life. Did the baby survive this pest only to be destroyed by that hag? Baarhani, baarhani!
6192355001152655 Such were the lines. I believed her, not you. End of discussion.
6192355001152656 I'm still thinking.
6192355001152657 Slow down!
6192355001154551 How should I know?
6192355001154552 Believe it or not, it's a talking bull.
6192355001154553 A boy like you. Very energetic.
6192355001154554 A hamster.
6192355001154555 Come on, you don't need to convince me. We trust you anyway, don't we, Jester? Jester does. And so do I. You're honest with us, we open our souls to you. Honesty is the key here.
6192355001154556 All right. What have you here?
6192355001154557 My enemy.
6192355001154558 Mortal?
6192355001154559 Are you two at war?
6192355001154560 That would be too strong a word… but fights happen, yes. When it all began, we fought until the first blood was drawn. There was a lot of spite.
6192355001154561 But why?
6192355001154562 Because of that stupid Tower. It changes how they think. Turns dreams real, imagine that. They're addicted to it.\nWe, on the other hand, don't need it at all. We have our own world, no less perfect. We have our Halves and both feet planted firmly on the ground… We don't try to escape reality.\nKhan called us traitors. Deserters. They can go blow… their Tower.
6192355001154563 I see. So what united you two?
6192355001154566 What does he want from you?
6192355001154567 What do candles have to do with it?
6192355001154568 Who cares? You're asking like you honestly believed that bullshit. Light candles, scare Death away. Light nine, become immortal… Ha, right. Like the world works that way.
6192355001154569 Then why are you to planning to check this bullshit?
6192355001154570 Death? A bird? What?
6192355001154571 So Death is a stay-at-home kind of guy… Huh.
6192355001154572 Wait until dawn, I guess. It's not like we have tons of matches.
6192355001154573 Are you stupid? Our friends would never do that. Something strange really <i>is</i> happening…
6192355001154574 Like what?
6192355001154575 We need to find a way to open that door.
6192355001154576 Are you for real?
6192355001154577 The place will become less gloomy in the light.
6192355001154578 I'll scout the house. Since we're here anyway…
6192355001154579 Stay here. If anything happens, scream, and I'll come for help.
6192355001154751 Orderly
6192355001154752 So can I continue?
6192355001154753 Yeah, yeah.

6192355001155351 Evergreen
6192355001157053 Someone is selling a bull here. Only three hundred for a truly honestly talking pet! Deal of the year!\n\nThen again, it's a good healthy bull.
6192355001157552 Khan
6192355001158251 Will you drop by today?
6192355001158253 Sure. In an hour or so.
6192355001158254 If you promise to feed me.
6192355001158255 Well… If I have the time. Which is to say, I doubt it.
6192355001159151 
6192355001159152 
6192355001159153 It was prophesied that I'd "spill rivers of blood" soon. Well, there are all kinds of blood.
6192355001159851 
6192355001159852 
6192355001159853 It's been prophesied I'll "spill rivers of blood." Do even greater sacrifices await me?
6192355001160051 
6192355001160052 Sticky
6192355001161451 Ah, our new doctor… but this ain't a drugstore. I can't help you.
6192355001161452 This is a sanitary inspection.
6192355001161453 Everything is clean here. No rats. And there's been no orders to close the shop. Or else I demand a warrant from the Kains.
6192355001161457 I've just been to them.
6192355001161458 Stop it with the nonsense, good sir. If you're here to buy, here's the counter. And if you're only interested in rambling, the door is over there. We're closed.
6192355001161459 No. First, you will answer a question for me.
6192355001165653 Wonder Bull
6192355001166051 So here's the plan.\nGo into the shop and ask the merchant something… complicated. Just make sure he gets carried away in the conversation. The longer and louder you talk, the better. Keep him occupied. Distracted. Got it?
6192355001166052 What are you up to, kid? Robbing his storeroom?
6192355001166053 Yeah… A silvertongue, you aren't. I couldn't get to the toolbox. Only grabbed a few small items.
6192355001166054 I don't talk. I do.
6192355001166055 Done and done! Got it. There, in the bag.
6192355001166056 You little risk-taker…
6192355001166057 In any case, the loot is plenty. There, in the bag. I could barely drag it out. Take the heavy things, and I'll carry the rest.
6192355001166058 Let's see…
6192355001166059 So, is the toolkit any good? Can we repair the alambic now?
6192355001166060 Like we have a choice…
6192355001166251 
6192355001166252 
6192355001166254 
6192355001168451 
6192355001169051 With Father's apparatus over there. The big one, I mean. I can't brew anything while it's broken, but I don't have a toolkit either… Shudkher!
6192355001169052 Hey, I know where we can get a toolkit! I'll get it for you… I mean, for us. \nThere's this place in the Atrium… and this guy who owes me. But I'll need your help. All right? The box is heavy, I can't carry it on my own.
6192355001169053 My help with what? Carrying the box, or following up on old debts? Then again, who cares…
6192355001169059 Sure, nothing to it.
6192355001169651 
6192355001169652 
6192355001169653 Because of the outbreak, we have nowhere to bury the dead. Corpses are just dumped at the cemetery. Grace forbids burning them.
6192355001169654 
6192355001169655 
6192355001169656 The dead no longer smother Grace. She's unhappy about it. I'm fine having offended her, so long as she's alive.
6192355001169657 Grace is right. We must not burn them. Let it all stay as it was.
6192355001169658 Grace is right. We must not burn them. Let it all stay as it was. I hope Capella's visions are just dreams.
6192355001169659 The dead no longer smother Grace. They won't reach her even if they continue to pile up: she's been relocated from the cemetery.
6192355001169660 We must not burn the dead. But piling them up inside Grace's small heart isn't an option, either. She's been relocated from the cemetery.
6192355001169661 Grace is right. We must not burn them—and taking her away from the cemetery would be wrong, too.\n\nLet it all stay as it has been. I hope Capella's visions are only dreams.
6192355001169662 
6192355001169663 
6192355001169664 It's too crowded underground, the dead are shrieking and smothering each other. Even I can hear it, if I try.
6192355001169665 
6192355001169666 
6192355001169667 Capella wants to tell me something. I don't know how I know it, only that I do.
6192355001169668 
6192355001169669 
6192355001169670 
6192355001169671 
6192355001169672 
6192355001169673 What was <i>that?</i> A hallucination? Has it devoured the dead? How, exactly? What kind of trickery is this?
6192355001169674 It's too crowded underground, indeed… Nice meeting you once again, my dear hometown.\n\nIf I burn the grave, this will stop for sure. But should I…?
6192355001169675 I've burned the grave. Other gravediggers will become bolder now. There will be fewer misplaced dead.
6192355001169676 
6192355001169677 
6192355001169678 
6192355001169679 
6192355001169680 
6192355001169681 
6192355001169682 
6192355001169683 
6192355001169684 
6192355001169685 
6192355001169686 
6192355001169687 
6192355001169688 
6192355001169689 
6192355001169690 
6192355001169691 
6192355001169692 
6192355001169693 
6192355001169694 
6192355001169695 Grace is "coming apart at the seams." If I don't hurry, something bad is about to happen.
6192355001169696 
6192355001169697 
6192355001169698 
6192355001169699 
6192355001169700 
6192355001169701 
6192355001169702 
6192355001169703 I guess I should pay a visit to Lara. At least <i>someone</i> in this town understands that doctors need to eat!
6192355001169704 
6192355001169705 
6192355001169706 Lara wants to turn her Shelter into a… well, <i>shelter</i> for the homeless. To do that, she needs a personal water barrel.\n\nI should look for one in the Middle Town: in the Spleen, the Maw, the Backbone, and so on.
6192355001169707 
6192355001169708 
6192355001169709 It's suspected that the Town's water barrels might be poisoned, even infected.
6192355001169710 
6192355001169711 
6192355001169712 I've found a barrel with suspiciously unclean water. But it's not like there's acid inside… The water just seems muddy. \n\nI need to think hard what to do about it.
6192355001169713 
6192355001169714 
6192355001169715 I have a sample of muddy water.\n\nIf I take it to the Bachelor, he'd certainly order all potentially dangerous barrels to be destroyed. A third of the Town will be left dehydrated—but safe.
6192355001169716 
6192355001169717 
6192355001169718 
6192355001169719 
6192355001169720 
6192355001169721 I've ordered that the suspicious barrel be delivered to the Shelter. Lara's "Home for the Living" will have water.\n\n…I have a bad feeling about it.
6192355001169724 So? Did you think it over? Any orders?
6192355001169725 You know what? Take this barrel to the outskirts, to Ravel's house. I'll examine it there.
6192355001169727 No. I'm still thinking. It takes time. Not that you would know.
6192355001169728 There's been a rumor that someone infected the barrels…
6192355001169729 I gave the suspicious sample to Dankovsky. It will be difficult for the townsfolk to stay hydrated with so many water barrels destroyed…
6192355001169730 I've ordered that the suspicious barrel be delivered to the Shelter. Lara's "Home for the Living" will have water.\n\n…What have I done?!
6192355001169746 
6192355001171251 Dora
6192355001171351 How did you find me?
6192355001171352 Followed my heart.
6192355001171353 Everything's covered in blood. Hey, why is that?
6192355001171354 The lamp by the door, you grand conspirator.
6192355001171355 So Bad Grief yapped, then? I'd throttle him with his own loose tongue, if I could.\nWhat are you doing here?
6192355001171356 What is that behind the curtains? Is it… shining?
6192355001171357 Wrong question. What are <i>you</i> doing here?
6192355001171358 Bad Grief didn't give you away. Well, he tried not to, at least.
6192355001171359 Who cares now. If you've found me, others will, too. And I'm short on time!
6192355001171360 Time for what?
6192355001171361 What are you afraid of? Who are you butchering here?
6192355001171362 I can't say anything right now. You don't want to know, anyway. Ignorance is bliss. Just trust me when I say it's important. Very important, Cub.
6192355001171363 Stakh. You're making medicine too, aren't you? Answer me!
6192355001171364 Come on, tell me. We must work together!
6192355001171365 Listen. I won't tell you anything until I'm done. Too many people would be let down. <i>The</i> person would…\nIf you want to know so badly, buy me some time to finish what I started!
6192355001171366 Buy from whom? Who are you hiding from?
6192355001171367 Your Kin are after me. Surrounding me like wolves. They haven't attacked yet, but soon will. Perhaps they're already here. Never far from you…
6192355001171368 What have you done to them? Stolen something?
6192355001171369 Stakh… You told me you have no idea what an "udurgh" is. What are you hiding behind those sheets?
6192355001171370 I know it's the Kin. But why?
6192355001171371 It's a long story. Will you stop asking?! Just lend me a hand! Scout the area around the warehouse. I suspect the steppe people wait for me…\nAnd if they have found me, well… Handle them.
6192355001171372 Handle them how?
6192355001171373 I don't know. However you can. Don't let them find me. They can sense where I am… I know their breed! They're getting close. I need more time! Just one more day! Or two… Maybe.
6192355001171374 Fine, to hell with you. Keep working.
6192355001171375 All right, I'll scout the area. Please hide better. Put the lamp out.
6192355001171376 I'll visit tomorrow night. I'll knock—our secret knock. I expect details.
6192355001171377 I know, I know. There's a swarm of vultures outside. Drawing closer, closer. That's all right. What matters is, I'm finished. I can rest now…
6192355001171378 Where is… whatever you worked with yesterday?
6192355001171379 You're finished with… what? Those people outside, what do they want?
6192355001171380 You're talking about death. Like hell, friend. Too early. You need sleep.
6192355001171381 It's depleted.
6192355001171382 You promised to tell me what you were doing.
6192355001171383 What was it, Stakh? Was it human? Was it… the Eighth on my list?
6192355001171384 I helped Dankovsky make a vaccine. My product is not what he wanted; it only provides temporary protection. But it's better than nothing.\nIt's not what <i>I</i> wanted, either… but I won't throw in the towel.
6192355001171385 What was it made of?
6192355001171386 What did you want to make?
6192355001171387 So you worked on a serum! Without me! Small wonder you failed. But why?
6192355001171388 I'll tell you later, if I survive to tell the tale.
6192355001171389 About your survival. Do you plan to just sit here and wait until they break in?
6192355001171390 What do these people want? They're from the Kin. Did you wrong them?
6192355001171391 All I want now is a good night's sleep… A few hours would do… I need to change hideouts. Nothing's keeping me here anymore.\nCan you distract them? Lead them away?
6192355001171392 Yes. I can do that.
6192355001171393 No. You've done something suspicious, something bad. I won't help you until I know more.
6192355001171394 I just need a few minutes to slip away. And then you run away, too, or give up. They want me, not you. They take you as one of their own. I don't want to hide behind you, but I can barely stay on my feet…
6192355001171395 Small wonder.
6192355001171396 That's fine. It's not the first time. All right, be ready to run.
6192355001171397 I'm not sure I'll manage. I'm on my last legs myself.
6192355001171398 What Eighth? What list? What are you talking about?
6192355001171399 Just tell me what you did.
6192355001171400 Tell me what you were working on, at least!
6192355001171401 I committed a crime in their spirit. A butcher crime. They were accused, so, many were murdered. I didn't come forward. I needed to finish the job.
6192355001171402 Sounds just like you.
6192355001171403 And now what? Do you plan to confess?
6192355001171404 Don't you dare confess. Or we'll have one less doctor.
6192355001171405 For now, I can't. Do as you will.
6192355001171406 All right, I'll help you out. Like I always do. Have it your way.
6192355001171407 I wouldn't beat a whole crowd, anyway.
6192355001172751 
6192355001172752 
6192355001172753 I can't run from my fears forever. Sooner or later I'll have to go home.
6192355001172754 Home sweet home is locked. The local authorities must have the key. I can't keep pretending this doesn't concern me.
6192355001172756 Sahba, also called Aspity, preserves the knowledge of my roots.
6192355001173157 Colleague, this is nonsense. You're stuck in the Middle Ages… I suppose I just have to accept this.\nWhenever an outbreak strikes, the rumor mill spins its wheels. Someone poisoned the wells! Who? Gypsies, heathens, witches, foreigners… I won't act without proof. Which doesn't exist.
6192355001173158 What's this, then?
6192355001173159 Good. Without water, we're done for.
6192355001173160 No ifs. Consider it infected. Then… Well, it's not like I have a choice! We'll follow the plan and destroy all the water barrels in the Middle Town. Effective immediately. We simply can't take any risks here.\nI can't shake this sense of dread… As if fate itself acts against us.
6192355001173161 Damn it… Lara!
6192355001173162 Great. So I robbed half the Town of water with my own hands.
6192355001173175 Well, I used to have a scalpel... but it came and went.
6192355001173176 Then have this one. We've kept one just in case...
6192355001173177 In case you need to cut an innocent person?
6192355001173178 I don't know… No. I'm not.
6192355001173179 That's not how I imagined our meeting to go, basaghan…
6192355001173180 What are you waiting for? Take what you need and go. You can sleep upstairs if you're tired.
6192355001173181 Aren't you happy to see me, Lara?
6192355001173251 It's hard to tell under all the covers, but it's a living baby. It should be brought to the Town Hall.
6192355001173252 Baby
6192355001173253 It feels strange to carry a baby like an item, but now isn't the time to be sentimental.
6192355001173254 
6192355001173255 Baby
6192355001173256 Another baby… How many are there? I should carry it to the Town Hall.
6192355001173257 A parcel of life.
6192355001173258 
6192355001174661 It wasn't me who found him, it was that circus performer. I'm just making the delivery.
6192355001175155 We ain't need a fifth.
6192355001175156 Yeah, four is enough. Got you!
6192355001175157 Well, you keep your watch.
6192355001177251 I've got an entire litter.
6192355001177253 Apologies. I thought you brought in a baby.
6192355001177254 You thought <i>I</i> brought in a baby?
6192355001177255 You thought I <i>brought in</i> a baby?
6192355001177256 You thought I brought in <i>a baby?</i>
6192355001177257 Do you visit infected houses during your work?
6192355001177258 If I have to.
6192355001177259 Normal, abandoned, infected… You name it.
6192355001177260 The Mistress decreed: Everyone who rescues an infant from an infected house is to bring it here. Such a dangerous feat won't go unrewarded.
6192355001177261 As if a baby stands a chance against sand pest.
6192355001180752 .....
6192355001180753 Good bull, who's a good bull… Uherney ereed bayna gyy?
6192355001180754 Khara bosooly! Got any surprises in store for me? How long do I need to wait? Shake your head, at least.
6192355001180755 I guess today will be all right, then.
6192355001180756 Booha, oh booha… Yamar berkhe! You're a surly one, aren't you?
6192355001180757 There is a chance! They discussed it earlier today: Adults are more susceptible to the disease! Babies can hold out the longest. Kids, too. Even teenagers, and those imps poke around everywhere. Most emerge none the worse for it! 
6192355001180758 Well I'll be damned…
6192355001180759 The other teenagers end up dead.
6192355001180760 You should inform Dankovsky about this. If babies really possess the greatest resistance… he should be able to use that, somehow.
6192355001180761 Who cares about rewards…
6192355001180762 Got it. If I ever find one, I'll bring it here.
6192355001180763 Anna Angel? Going outside, today of all days? That seems unlikely. She has a fit every time people mention dirt around her. It must've been someone else.
6192355001180764 I know. I got suspicious, so I intervened and brought the baby straight to you.
6192355001180765 Maybe she desperately needs money. That, or she's desperately trying to get into everyone's good graces.
6192355001180766 It was her. She's braver than she looks.
6192355001180767 You can't know that.
6192355001180768 Well… Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith. It's better than just not doing anything at all.
6192355001180769 Perhaps it is fate. Our paths must have crossed for a reason… for the benefit of that kid.
6192355001180770 It was a girl…
6192355001180771 How do you know?
6192355001180772 What do you mean, "was"? Are you still trying to accuse that woman? That's slander!
6192355001180773 She needed that baby more. If you truly want to do good, find another opportunity. They're plentiful.
6192355001180774 Turns out, you <i>are</i> of help. I think we'll get along just fine.
6192355001181251 This hunt for blood sounds dangerous, Cub. Won't you just infect yourself? Promise me you'll be as careful as you can. If you need me, please ask.
6192355001181252 I'm not making any promises.
6192355001181253 I promise.
6192355001181254 Thank you, Lara. You're the only one who believes in me.
6192355001181651 So we've met. Can't say any of us are eager to meet again soon. Lara is alive and well, and that's good enough.
6192355001183651 That Stakh Rubin, akhar. Your father's false student. You know him. Tell me what he does at night.
6192355001183652 I can tell you what ho doesn't do: sleep. As far as I can tell.
6192355001183653 I barely know him.
6192355001183654 "False"? He was a very loyal student. Went overboard, even.
6192355001183655 Tell me, what does he do during the night? Where does he hide?
6192355001183656 Why do you care?
6192355001183657 Ask him yourself. During the day, he's in the hospital, working.
6192355001183658 Good question…
6192355001183659 He has no respect for the dead. No respect for the body. He cuts bodies open without grace. He knows not the Lines.\nHe's an outsider.
6192355001183660 Precisely. Outsiders have no obligation to honor our traditions.
6192355001183661 For what it's worth, I'm an outsider too.
6192355001183662 The Khatanghe are worried. Your friend is doing evil. The blame, as always, will be pinned to us. And we are dwindling by the hour as it is. Mere hundreds left now.
6192355001183663 Unente… Don't tell me. I know.
6192355001183664 I think… Actually, disregard that. I don't think anything.
6192355001183665 I'll take care of him. He's my friend, after all. Not yours.
6192355001183666 He won't say. And we don't have time. He needs to be stopped. Fast. Very fast.
6192355001183667 Why?
6192355001183668 You're right. Otherwise he might die from exhaustion.
6192355001183669 I'm curious now. What <i>does</i> he do at night…?
6192355001183752 We managed to hold until dawn. Whatever it was, it's gone now. Now I need to grab the boys and leave this place.
6192355001184551 Don't worry, I'm used to these kinds of jobs. I won't get caught.
6192355001184552 Whoa… Hold your horses. So I'm providing shelter for a little crook?
6192355001184553 What do you mean, "used to"?
6192355001184554 I can crawl through any vent. I've been an orphan since I was very little. What else am I supposed to do?
6192355001184555 Work?
6192355001184556 Hey, come on! I'm no thief! I only do it for fun. Well, unless I get real hungry… Hunger does that to people.\nI also leave small trinkets behind, sometimes. Like mementos.
6192355001184557 Why did you lie to me? You said a guy here owed you!
6192355001184558 Cleaning Fat Belly's cauldrons at the cannery? Sure, I'll get right on it.\nWork… Freedom is better. Who wants to cut up a bunch of bodies all day and night, anyway? Nah. I prefer <i>jobs</i> over work.
6192355001184559 "Jobs." You mean crimes.
6192355001184560 I do. I cut up bodies.
6192355001184561 You've crawled through vents since you were very little, too?
6192355001184562 Well, he does! Do you have <i>any</i> idea how stingy that man is? He never pays more than half price for whatever you get him.\nWho do you think he got the toolkit from in the first place? Strain and Patches brought it to him. They carried the thing all the way from the Tanners, and he only paid half a hundred!
6192355001184563 So he's a fence, then…
6192355001184564 Patches, huh…
6192355001184565 Stop being so stubborn, will you? I'd never offer you anything unfair. Illegal, maybe, but it won't stain your conscience.\nAnd, in any case… the cure is more important, isn't it?
6192355001184566 Make up your mind about how you're trying to convince me.
6192355001184567 And where did <i>they</i> get it from? Just found it in the steppe?
6192355001184568 Nah. In the street.
6192355001184569 Your lack of shame is honestly impressive.
6192355001184570 What an incredible feat.
6192355001184571 "For fun." For fun!
6192355001184572 The law matters, kid. Come on, let's go home.
6192355001184573 Come on! It's easy! Just talk to him for as long as you can and make sure he doesn't break conversation. The longer you keep him, the more I'll be able to… repossess.
6192355001184574 No chance, kid. We should buy that toolkit fair and square. That'll be a lesson for you.
6192355001184575 All right. Let's do it. Just don't get caught.
6192355001185151 By the way… a bunch of Soul-and-a-Halves just walked by. New scouts. They have something for you. Said they want to help out "the son"—that's you, the Old Man's son.
6192355001185152 Scouts? What do they scout, I wonder?
6192355001185153 The infection. It moves around the Town, changes districts. They map it.
6192355001185154 Little morons… Are they out of their minds?
6192355001185155 No, we'll return to the shop and sell it back! Ugh, why did I even agree to this…
6192355001185156 Not a thinker, either.
6192355001185157 So I take it someone here hasn't been spanked in a while?
6192355001185158 It depends…
6192355001185159 Let's skip out of here. Fast.
6192355001185162 You'll carry everything. Let that burden be your lesson about conscience.
6192355001185163 It wasn't true, though. Just a medical joke.
6192355001185164 I never said anything like that. You misheard.
6192355001185165 So we now have three dozen little plague carriers on our hands. Lovely.
6192355001185166 That's one huge bag…
6192355001185167 I already know… They were looking for trouble and found it. Come on, we have to get back to work.
6192355001185168 As if we didn't have enough trouble already. All right, I'm going.
6192355001185169 I have no intention of buying anything. Just wanted to meet you.
6192355001185170 But <i>I</i> can help <i>you.</i> You've got a rash all over your face, red eyes… Those are the signs.
6192355001185171 Why? I don't give out goods on trust anymore, not in times like these. I know who you are: a doctor. You know who I am: a merchant. There's no reason for us to pretend we're friends.
6192355001185172 Well, having a doctor as a friend might come in handy these days. Doctors and merchants are anyone's most useful contacts.
6192355001185173 Is that some kind of joke?
6192355001185174 Now is not a time for jokes. Do you think I would just drop by at random?
6192355001185175 So what, will I be quarantined now? Is this… <i>the thing?</i>\n…Come on, talk, you bastard! Is it?
6192355001185176 I'm afraid so.
6192355001185177 Then this is it. I'm done. Go, doctor. I need to think of my soul now.
6192355001185178 Calm down. It was just a joke.
6192355001185179 Oh, so this is your idea of of a joke? I love jokes. I'm a funny guy too. I think I'll charge you extra from now on. As a kind of humor tax, you know? So think twice before you make another joke—or it will all <i>cost</i> you twice.\nNow buy what you came to buy or get lost.
6192355001185180 Come on... that was uncalled for.
6192355001185181 I suspect it might be. We'll need to check.
6192355001185182 What's there to check? It's lethal. Everyone knows it. But… did you mean it?
6192355001185183 Slow down. No need to jump to conclusions. In our line of work, miracles happen.
6192355001185184 You got me. I was just kidding… Ha ha. The look on your face!
6192355001185185 Calm down. If it were the sand pest, you'd be convulsing on the floor already. It's different.
6192355001185188 I did.
6192355001185189 What do you mean?
6192355001185190 You know, I remember this story… One time, a person inhaled a pine tree cone. Can you guess what happened?
6192355001185191 Well? What is it?
6192355001185192 So here's a coin. Heads or tails? Choose.
6192355001185193 Perhaps there is a reason. There's an outbreak in town, haven't you heard?
6192355001185194 There an outbreak in the Town. For now, it's only touched the poorer districts, but who knows…
6192355001185195 An outbreak? So what? Am I selling rotten meat? No. Find yourself a food store to harass!
6192355001185196 So you might be a dead man walking already, pal.
6192355001185197 Come now… No one is accusing you.
6192355001185198 What's that behind your back?
6192355001185199 Is this your idea of fun, sawbones? I won't be the butt of your jokes. I might not have studied in a big city, but I have my dignity. Good day.
6192355001185200 Well… This didn't work out.
6192355001185201 Hey, let's trade, at least.
6192355001185202 And to you! See you around.
6192355001185203 Why so rude? Expecting someone? Eager to turn away a potential witness, maybe? I've heard you're not just a seller, but a buyer, too…
6192355001185204 I'll take a look at your wares.
6192355001185205 Damn it... I hope the kid was quick.
6192355001185206 Sounds about right. You're not the most honest person in town, are you?
6192355001185207 Well?
6192355001185208 A month passes.
6192355001185209 Forget it. Let's get down to business. Do you buy… ahem… derelict goods?
6192355001185210 What's at stake?
6192355001185211 Everything.
6192355001185212 Just choose.
6192355001185213 I need to know what the stakes are.
6192355001185214 I can't choose for you. That would be dishonest.
6192355001185215 Your life.
6192355001185216 Choose.
6192355001185217 But I haven't bet anything.
6192355001185218 You have.
6192355001185219 The stake is your life. Always has been. You just never noticed.
6192355001185220 Well?
6192355001185221 Well… Tails, I guess.
6192355001185222 I'm afraid you lose.
6192355001185223 Where do you get your goods?
6192355001185224 We doctors have a very particular brand of humor. It's different.
6192355001185225 Yeah, it is… Relax.
6192355001185226 Lucky you. You don't even know how lucky…
6192355001185227 Keep this coin. Dark times are coming. It'll come in handy.
6192355001185228 No. No, he wasn't well. It killed him. What did you expect?
6192355001185229 And?
6192355001185230 And they find a tumor in his chest. Cancer. Growths all over.
6192355001185231 Come on, speak up!
6192355001185232 So I dissect him. And you know what I find in his chest?
6192355001185233 No need to rush. This is just a preamble…
6192355001185234 If I knew, I'd make you pay for every minute of my patience. Which has, by the way, run out.
6192355001185235 A pine tree branch! Lungs are rich with oxygen, so it sprouted. So yeah, things happen…
6192355001185236 Then I won't tell you how it ends. Stay ignorant.
6192355001185237 I'm not so rich as to pay for someone's patience. See you, good man.
6192355001185751 The small contraption in the Lair can be used to produce herbal tinctures.

6192355001185757 Precise. Long-range. Deadly.
6192355001185758 I've held such a rifle in my hands only once before. I'd prefer to not think about that day.
6192355001186051 Thanks for coming by.
6192355001186052 I'm just here to check in on Patches.
6192355001186054 Thanks for having me.
6192355001186055 Ah. He's dead.
6192355001186056 Dead? When did it happen?
6192355001186057 I'm sorry, kids.
6192355001186058 Same day you examined him. In the evening. Never mind… \nNotkin even asked Clara for help, in the end. But, like, she couldn't do anything either. Even she is helpless against the sand pest.
6192355001186059 We're all in a great deal of trouble.
6192355001186060 I'll find a cure, boy. I promise.
6192355001186061 I fear Notkin could have caught the infection… But we hope it's just canine distemper.
6192355001186062 Shudkher! No, no...
6192355001186063 No, kid. Humans don't get dog diseases. Not even the Soul-and-a-Halves.
6192355001186064 Why did you come, anyway?
6192355001186065 Is this an interrogation? Just wanted to see how you're doing.
6192355001186066 To check up on Patches. How's he doing? Getting better?
6192355001186067 Here. This is for you. Made by our scouts.
6192355001186068 What is it?
6192355001186069 A map of the infection. Our scouts sneak everywhere… Will it be useful?
6192355001186070 It will.
6192355001186071 You shouldn't have risked it. I won't take it. And never do it again.
6192355001186072 You sneak into infected districts?
6192355001186073 Very carefully. It's a public service! We want to help you doctors!
6192355001186074 You little blockheads! This district would have been clear, if not for you! I won't take it!
6192355001186075 What do you mean, "carefully"?
6192355001186076 It means what it means. Why do you think I'm sitting outside and not going in there?
6192355001186077 You morons… <i>Morons!</i>
6192355001186078 Hand it over. And never do that again!

6192355001188555 Yeah… I gathered as much.
6192355001191451 Nerve
6192355001191452 Blood
6192355001191453 Skin
6192355001192051 Oh for the love of… How could you know <i>that?</i> Your talents include seeing the future <i>and</i> what's in my pockets?
6192355001192251 
6192355001192252 Khatangher
6192355001192253 The booha grants you his blood. Take the blood.\nThe booha are immune to Earth plague. The disease rolls off them. Water off fowl. The blood is strong. Drink it, yargachin. It's good for your health.
6192355001192254 They don't ever get sick? You're sure?
6192355001192255 Bayarlaa, people. I'll take as much as I need myself.
6192355001192256 We keep eyes on every bull. We love them. Know them better than our children. If a bull died, how could we have missed it?\nA learned man came to us. He said, "The bulls brought the disease." He was a fool. He made a mistake.
6192355001192257 No, he's no fool… Perhaps I should tell him of this bull thing.
6192355001192258 So there's something special about their blood. Sure, why not.
6192355001192259 That's fine, pal. I'll take the bull's gift. Bayarlaa.
6192355001192260 You found us, yargachin. We are happy to have you here. We looked for a butcher, a butcher to help us restore order. To complete the rank.
6192355001192261 What are you celebrating, children of mine?
6192355001192262 What order? What rank?
6192355001192263 Is the girl comfortable up there? Are you sure she won't catch a cold?
6192355001192264 Behold this perfect body. It must be properly divided.
6192355001192265 You're talking about the bull, I hope.
6192355001192266 A perfect body… A chimera. I get it. The girl fused with the bull, and must be separated. Right?
6192355001192267 So, a rite. I thought such traditions were long forgotten. Did you revive it because of the plague?
6192355001192268 You're a funny man, yargachin. I'm glad to hear your jokes. We also joke, sometimes. Among the Kin. Yes. Jokes…
6192355001192269 Is this your attempt to end the plague?
6192355001192270 The outbreak is only one misfortune. We do this for other reasons. \nThe bull is like the world. A yargachin cuts the bull along the Lines, and the world comes to order. The bull is pleased. We are pleased. You are pleased.
6192355001192271 Fine. I know the Lines. I'll cut the bull.
6192355001192272 No. I won't be pleased at all. Find another butcher.
6192355001192273 We can grant blood. All you want. The booha's blood, free of Earth disease. Never sick.
6192355001192274 Really? That changes things.
6192355001192275 When I need blood, I'll take a sample from any bull. No killing required.
6192355001192276 Look. He says farewell to the Town. The Town says farewell. While he walks the streets, the Town grows into him, binds him with love. When it is done, he will return to the place of blood, the Ragi Barrow.\nWe will wait for the butcher there.
6192355001192277 You do that. I'll come soon.
6192355001192278 I'll think about it.
6192355001193253 Getting the taste of it, huh, ripper?
6192355001193254 Huh?
6192355001193255 Who are you? An orderly? What were you doing in there?
6192355001193256 You should be wondering who I saw.
6192355001193257 What is that white cross on the door? Did you mark our house?
6192355001193258 I did.
6192355001193259 Any luck?
6192355001193260 I've found one. It's near the Stillwater.
6192355001193261 How fares you kine, Khatangher?
6192355001193262 How fares your kine, abgay.
6192355001193267 
6192355001194951 He is ready, yargachin, he only waits for you, yargachin. Much joy in such waiting. Soon he will become himself, and the sky and earth will return to their due places. Gorkhon shall flow, and harsh winter will chase away the foul autumn. That which came from the ground shall return to the ground.\nA blade for you, yargachin. To trace his Lines properly.
6192355001194952 That's a good blade.
6192355001195251 Desperate One
6192355001195252 I've done nothing yet. But I'm about to.
6192355001195651 I take your business, whatever it is, seriously.

6192355001195658 May
6192355001195659 Don't worry about it. Just a union. Of people under fifteen. Anyway, ask her. She might be mad at me if I say too much.
6192355001195660 Okay.
6192355001195661 Good. Tight lips are a good skill to have.
6192355001195662 Is she at her place, in the Lump?
6192355001195663 Damned if I know. Either there or at the Station. Just… don't stomp around if you ever go there. It's a discreet place, not for the grown-ups.
6192355001195664 The Station is a discreet place? Trains have become rare indeed…
6192355001195665 I won't stomp around. I'll just take a peek.
6192355001195666 Busybody
6192355001197851 
6192355001197852 
6192355001197853 I'm exhausted. Maybe a bottle of twyrine would reinvigorate my thoughts?
6192355001200355 That's what they call a bull marked for slaughter. Butchering a body imitates an act of creation. \nActually, I've heard that such a ritual will take place on this very day. They've brought in a bull from the steppe, now they parade it on the streets. It's the principle of correspondence in action.
6192355001200356 Huh… Interesting.
6192355001200357 That's what they call a bull marked for slaughter. Butchering a body imitates an act of creation. \nActually, I've heard that such a ritual will take place tomorrow. They'll bring in a bull from the steppe and parade it on the streets. It's the principle of correspondence in action.
6192355001200358 Huh… Interesting.
6192355001200359 Correspondence?
6192355001200360 Correspondence?
6192355001200361 Yes, I know.
6192355001200362 Sayn bayna, ekhene.
6192355001200363 Things are looking up. A beautiful bull is coming from the Steppe to walk the streets soon. Here, in the Earth, to chase away the pest. To restore things to how they were.
6192355001200364 Do you think it will help?
6192355001200365 Why bring one from the Steppe? Don't we have enough of our own?
6192355001200366 That bull is clean, closer to Mother Boddho, to the Earth herself. All of ours are too close to the Olonngo. They expect death-Suok to grab them by the horns any day.
6192355001200367 Do you believe in the old rites?
6192355001200368 Not sure. The elders believe, and the young ones don't. \nTrying won't hurt, I think. There are ten reasons behind every change, but only one of them matters. How does one find it?
6192355001200369 You're right about trying.
6192355001200370 May only good changes come visit you, abgay.
6192355001200371 I know.
6192355001200372 He said farewell to the Town. The Town touched him and bound him with the string of love. The time for farewells is over. It is time to leave for the Ragi Barrow, the place of blood.\nGood thing you've come, yargachin. You know the Lines, you can complete the rite.
6192355001200373 Let's go.
6192355001200374 I'll think about it.
6192355001200375 No need. I'd rather use my own.
6192355001200376 No you won't, yargachin. We are numerous, and all of us need to partake of his blood.\nEvery bucket will nourish many Kindred souls. We are grateful for your craft, and so your share is bigger than any of ours already.
6192355001200377 When was the last time a bull died on its own?
6192355001200378 Funny, I had something similar happen. Lost the whole bull…
6192355001200381 Damn this town… I feel I'm trapped in a nightmare. The absurdity of it all… There's no one to talk to. Everyone's so volatile.\nThey all seem to want to help, but… their help is worse than hostility.
6192355001200382 I can genuinely help you, erdem. Examine this. It's bull blood.
6192355001200383 Leave it with me, I'll study it. Will only take a few hours. In that time, I suggest you hit the cot somewhere. I've seen corpses prettier than you.
6192355001200384 I can't. I have a lot on my plate. I'll just drop by later.
6192355001200386 All right. Thanks, erdem.
6192355001200387 Now that's a good question! Everyone else mourns while they celebrate. I think you know why. The beasts overflow with joy… Made a half-naked girl ride the thing… Shameless!
6192355001200388 Huh. Now <i>that</i> is a sight to behold.
6192355001200389 What is there to celebrate?
6192355001200391 Yeah, I remember hearing about the bull. So it's in the Hindquarters?
6192355001200394 This activity needs to be immediately curtailed. Do you know which house they were planning to visit?
6192355001200395 What do you mean? Lots of them.
6192355001200396 I have a favor to ask of you, Burakh. Find at least one house where the living harbor the dead. Find it and mark the door with… say, a white cross, as they did with the plague in the old days.\nIt will become my proof. Then I'll have leverage to deal with this matter.
6192355001200397 Leverage? Do you really need it? No one would question a Kain's actions.
6192355001200398 Doesn't a white cross mean a house is condemned?
6192355001200399 My informant told me that this has been going for a whole day, maybe longer.
6192355001200400 Exactly. We're the Kains. People only let us break the laws of nature because we obey the laws of justice. Do you understand?
6192355001200401 I do.
6192355001200651 It makes sense to show bull blood to Dankosky. He's the man with a microscope.
6192355001200652 While Dankovsky is working, I could take a nap or do other things. I'll check on his progress in a couple of hours.
6192355001200653 I think Dankovsky must be done with the bull blood.
6192355001203851 What did you call me?
6192355001203852 What would you have me call you? A haruspex?
6192355001203853 Huh?
6192355001203854 Well, you brought me more human organs, didn't you? Or did you just drop by for a chat?
6192355001203855 Do you know that your neighbor has a side job?
6192355001203856 He's just helping people, like me. It's called "compassion." As for his methods, they're none of my business. I stay out of his, he stays out of mine, that's how we stay good neighbors.\nI suggest you do the same.
6192355001203857 One day they'll bust you both.
6192355001203858 Actually, I know a brilliant joke about it. A dentist, a surgeon, and a veterinarian walk into a dissecting room...
6192355001203859 Stale.
6192355001203860 All right, how about a newer one? So there is this chemist who embalms the dead...
6192355001203861 Well... God be with you, kind people.
6192355001203862 Mind your own safety.
6192355001203863 I've nothing to hide.
6192355001203864 If I'm busted, I'll know whom to thank for it.
6192355001203865 I can tell it's not the plague. Your skin is normal.
6192355001203866 Flu… I doubt I can help you out with that.
6192355001203867 What does it mean?
6192355001203868 It means, "woe is this house."
6192355001203869 And don't you dare erase it… or mark other houses.
6192355001203870 Do you live here?
6192355001203871 Yes.
6192355001203872 Did you commission someone to… preserve your dead?
6192355001203873 We were scared they'd lock us all in if they found out…
6192355001203874 Well, now they will. But they wouldn't have if you'd just buried your dead properly.
6192355001203875 Don't worry, no one will harm you. Just bury your dead.
6192355001203876 The Kains' people will come here soon. Stay elsewhere until they're done.
6192355001203877 You have unburied people there.
6192355001203878 Leave us be, I beg of you… Don't tell anyone. We'll… we'll bury them all later. Tonight. At the cemetery. Just don't tell on us…
6192355001203879 Promise?
6192355001203880 I can't. It needs to be stopped, or else the whole district might get infected.
6192355001203881 I promise. I promise! Just don't tell them… They'll lock us all in… They'll sandbox us. Certain death. I'd give you money, but we have nothing left!
6192355001203882 Save your money. Just do as you promised.
6192355001203883 Calm down. No one will lock you in. And don't you dare erase the cross I'm about to draw.
6192355001203884 I marked the door with a cross. Send your people, just don't be too hard on the locals.
6192355001203885 Why would we harm them? Their only crime was being scared. What kind of monster punishes fear in times like these? Everyone is afraid, including you and me.
6192355001203886 You're right, I am afraid.
6192355001203887 It's the thinkers and dreamers who can afford fear. I am a doer.
6192355001205051 Odd sounds are coming from this house.
6192355001205052 The dead are hidden here.\n\nThe tenants are begging me not to mark the place. Are their fears without merit? The choice is mine.
6192355001205053 This house is so silent you can almost hear it.
6192355001205054 This house has already been marked with a cross… Not by me.
6192355001207652 The Town is calling to me...
6192355001207751 
6192355001207752 
6192355001207753 That's it. I don't have it in me to play guessing games anymore. Should I take a nap, maybe? There's always the hope I never wake up.
6192355001211052 Seems like the local urchins need assistance.
6192355001220051 Khatanger
6192355001221251 Don't go there now. Today, he's not listening. Go tomorrow, after you wake.\nFind the Ear, whisper in it, and it'll grant you a wish. And please let him know I hate it here and can't wait to leave! I've had enough of this place, tiimel daa…
6192355001221252 I'll be sure to let him know.
6192355001221253 Go there as soon as you wake. Find the Ear, whisper in it, and it'll grant you a wish. And please let him know I hate it here and can't wait to leave! I've had enough of this place, tiimel daa…
6192355001221254 I'll be sure to let him know.
6192355001221255 And do come back here sometime.
6192355001221256 I will. You take care of yourself.
6192355001221274 Go into the steppe in a few hours. Follow the railroad tracks… The long ones that unfurl to the outside world. A real line, not your metaphors.\nYou'll find me waitin'.
6192355001221275 I'll figure it out.
6192355001221276 I understand all kinds of lines. I'll find you.
6192355001221277 Those aren't metaphors.
6192355001224382 I know, I know. There's a swarm of vultures outside. Drawing closer, closer. That's all right. What matters is, I'm finished. I can rest now…
6192355001224383 Where is… whatever you worked with yesterday?
6192355001224385 You're talking about death. Like hell, friend. Too early. You need sleep.
6192355001224386 It's depleted.
6192355001224387 You promised to tell me what you were doing.
6192355001224388 What was it, Stakh? Was it human? Was it… the Eighth on my list?
6192355001224389 I helped Dankovsky make a vaccine. My product is not what he wanted; it only provides temporary protection. But it's better than nothing.\nIt's not what <i>I</i> wanted, either… but I won't throw in the towel.
6192355001224390 What was it made of?
6192355001224391 What did you want to make?
6192355001224392 So you worked on a serum! Without me! Small wonder you failed. But why?
6192355001224393 I'll tell you later, if I survive to tell the tale.
6192355001224394 Please be so kind as to survive.
6192355001224396 All I want now is a good night's sleep… A few hours would do…
6192355001224403 What Eighth? What list? What are you talking about?
6192355001224404 Just tell me what you did.
6192355001224405 Tell me what you were working on, at least!
6192355001224413 Nope. They're finished. Where there was a swarm, now there is no one.
6192355001224414 Did you… fix their vital signs, sawbones?
6192355001224415 Well… Sort of.
6192355001224416 I just asked very nicely, and they went home.
6192355001224417 How about hitting the cot right here? I can work your shift in the hospital tomorrow.
6192355001224418 A few days, you wanted to say.
6192355001224419 Noted.
6192355001224628 Why are the Kin after you? Tell me.
6192355001224629 Not here. It's a long story, and this place is… well, unsuitable. If you really want to talk about it, come by my place tonight. Or tomorrow.
6192355001224630 Got it. So what do we have here? What work needs to be done?
6192355001224631 I've seen him already. And I've done all I could.
6192355001224632 I know why you feel this way, Murky…
6192355001225972 Why?
6192355001225973 Because if you're infected, but you don't die, that means… means… never mind. It means nothing.
6192355001225974 There's a rumor circulating around that the carrier of the pest is an orphan girl. Show me your tongue.
6192355001225975 I'm not sick! Nope, not me. Never am. I don't even get colds, not even when I'm soaked and barefoot.
6192355001225976 …True. No signs of the disease.
6192355001225977 Yeah… It's all nonsense, of course. You can't be a carrier. I don't even need a blood sample…
6192355001225978 Because I'm a doctor and I said so. Look at the light and let me examine your pupils.
6192355001225979 You do that.
6192355001225980 So we will! We aren't suckers, and we <i>definitely</i> aren't cowards. Promise you that.
6192355001225981 And who is "we"?
6192355001225982 Scouts.
6192355001225983 I'd love to remember my childhood for a while and play with you kids. But I've got a different war on my hands.
6192355001225984 What will be done?
6192355001225985 The thing we're making will help you a bunch. Come to Notkin's Castle and see for yourself. But for now, it's a secret. A surprise!
6192355001225986 I don't like surprises.
6192355001225987 Why can't you urchins just stay home?
6192355001225988 Best way to help me would be staying safe, so you don't end up on my table. Got it?
6192355001225989 Hey, uncle! Can you fix the turner for us, please? It's close, over in the Nutshell. Please, please, please! Pretty please!
6192355001225990 The turner? What?
6192355001225991 Yes, of course. Let me drop everything and run to fix your "turner."
6192355001225992 Well, since you know the magic word… I suppose it is my duty.
6192355001225993 Yeah. A turner. You know… That thing that turns on itself. Like, like…
6192355001225994 …Luck.
6192355001225995 …A windmill.
6192355001225996 …A planet?
6192355001225997 Fix it, will you?
6192355001225998 Someday, maybe.
6192355001225999 Story of my life in a… uh, in <i>the</i> Nutshell.
6192355001226000 I never believed these ancient fairy-tales. None of us do any longer.
6192355001226001 Yamar berkhe basaghan bai...
6192355001226002 Would you like me to lend you my jacket? It's all covered in blood, but that's nothing new to you...
6192355001226003 "Yargachin" means "a butcher." What makes you think I am one?
6192355001226004 Be khara, you are a doctor who can dissect bodies. Has the right to. Knows which lines to trace with his knife. It's the same as a butcher.
6192355001226005 Weird. Do I have "doctor" written all over me?
6192355001226006 I can barely remember our tongue. How was it... Be oylgono ugyb, basaghan. Explain, please.
6192355001226007 My mother died giving birth to me. I don't remember her, but I need no other.
6192355001226351 Warm One
6192355001229451 …Are you an idiot? Or just hammered? Why would you spout such ridiculous lies? Wannabe Herostratus…
6192355001229452 Who?
6192355001230251 Nara
6192355001230951 …What do you have here, in the corner? Do my eyes deceive me? Is there really a well inside this house?
6192355001230952 Your eyes do not deceive you. It is, indeed, a well.
6192355001230953 Did you dig it?
6192355001230954 Insanity.
6192355001230955 But why…?
6192355001230956 Yes, yes, I know. Sacrilege. Taboo. \nHave you ever wondered what's behind that superstition?
6192355001230957 No. I've just been brought up this way.
6192355001230958 Did you make it out of… idle curiosity?
6192355001230959 Things change. You couldn't have missed the Tower on the other side.\nA couple of years ago, Father also introduced water infrastructure—actual pipes, Burakh. Didn't you notice the pumps? The pipes don't even run deep, but the outrage was a sight to behold.
6192355001230960 Small wonder.
6192355001230961 I'm surprised there wasn't a riot. Then again, considering your father's temper…
6192355001230962 Exactly. If they only tried…\nYou might find it surprising, but I lean toward the side of the common folk in this matter. Didn't we talk about that?
6192355001230963 Explain.
6192355001230964 I wanted to see what's behind all this superstition. I'm generally very fond of the Kin's folklore.\nYou see… I believe that by figuring out the inner motives of these people, we could create a truly solid economy. Help them accept the future, so to speak…
6192355001230965 So what did you find?
6192355001230966 I don't know yet. It hasn't gone smoothly. The deeper we dig, the less willing people are to descend. Still, no monsters have emerged, not yet.
6192355001230967 So… You called for me to show me… this?
6192355001230968 There probably <i>is</i> something behind the superstition. And I suggest you leave it buried.
6192355001230969 When I require your advice on this matter, dear Artemy, I'll be sure to let you know. But today is not that day.\nThis is my business. My responsibility.
6192355001230970 So what do you need of me today, then?
6192355001231851 Thanks.
6192355001232451 Ugh, back to square one. You think I'm some kind of avatar for the plague? What's wrong with you?! Are you still a child?
6192355001232452 I don't know. I'm not sure. Everything's possible.
6192355001232453 No, I'm doing what an adult must, trying to get to the bottom of all this.
6192355001232454 You're a shapeshifter, after all. I just feel it. Someone wears you like a glove.
6192355001232455 You're a good judge of character…
6192355001232466 All right. Let's try this. Your Murky is still on her way. I can sense her. She might get stranded, after all—these things happen.\nLet's test you, then. What do you know of the sand pest? Tell me!
6192355001232467 It's connected to Earth somehow.
6192355001232468 People say it didn't start on its own, that there's some scheme behind it.
6192355001232469 I do know not everyone dies from it. Some folks are beyond its reach.
6192355001232470 You're right, I still don't know enough. I don't understand the world I live in.
6192355001232471 If you agree to this, your Murky might live longer. And her friend will, from now on, address you directly—no middlemen, no interference.\nWhat say you, oh brave ripper?
6192355001232472 Deal. But leave Murky alone. And never touch her again!
6192355001232473 I'd say you're a horrible person. And useless. Forget it.
6192355001232485 What a disappointment. Even Murky had more curiosity. What is there to talk about? You can't save anyone. Not even yourself.
6192355001232486 Surely she's home now. Or maybe in that lonely train car…
6192355001232487 Oh, shut it. You're lying, as always.
6192355001233351 I can do many things. Haven't I told you already? I have. Twice, I think. So don't complain now.
6192355001233352 Where's Murky?
6192355001233353 Watch my hands. The right knows not what the left does. The left knows not what the right does. The forepaw doesn't follow the hindpaw; the midfoot, the forefoot; the lower hand, the secret one; the upper hand—the elegant one. \nWhat are you looking at?
6192355001233354 …You're a fast sprinter.
6192355001233357 You don't believe me… You don't want to. Fine. Be my guest. Check.\nYou want an easy answer, don't you? You want a monster you can drive a stake into, or bargain with… That'd be so heroic, wouldn't it? And so much simpler than the hard work of discovering a cure.
6192355001233358 Yeah, right. What could be simpler than slaying a monster?
6192355001233359 Work, Burakh! Forget this child's play! Steppe miracles, childhood mysteries… Leave them to me. Step aside, and deal in earthly matters.\nGo! Work! Deal with your damn town! You're the one who must figure out what it's made of.
6192355001233360 But who was Murky talking to?
6192355001233363 Hanging the cure over my head? You think I've made no progress?
6192355001233364 That's unfair of you.
6192355001233365 Fair enough… Thanks for setting me straight.
6192355001233366 Murky talks to rocks and herbs. Murky was raised by steppe wolves. She's a wolf cub herself. Why would you ever take her words seriously?
6192355001233367 Yeah… You're right. Go. I'll take Murky home.
6192355001233368 Kids deserve trust, or bad things happen. I know from experience.
6192355001233369 What kind of trick is this?
6192355001233370 Uh… Did you see Murky?
6192355001234051 
6192355001234052 
6192355001234053 I know a good obstetrician, all right… He'll cut whatever needs to be cut, including railroads.
6192355001234054 
6192355001234055 
6192355001234058 Grief will wait for me at the railroad after midnight. We'll cut the unnecessary Line together.
6192355001234065 I didn't go with Grief. I wonder if he blew anything up without me? I doubt it.
6192355001234066 
6192355001234067 We're not blowing anything up. Grief says he never planned to. All we have is hope.
6192355001234068 I didn't meet up with Grief. I wonder if he blew anything up without me? I doubt it.
6192355001234151 
6192355001234152 
6192355001234153 Rubin spends nights at home now.
6192355001234154 I need to put five more organs into the ice box.
6192355001234155 I need to put four more organs into the ice box.
6192355001234156 I need to put three more organs into the ice box.
6192355001234157 I need to put two more organs into the ice box.
6192355001234158 I need to put one more organ into the ice box.
6192355001234159 Saburov already found Father's murderer once. I barely escaped that investigation. I don't care whom he slanders today.
6192355001234160 Rubin spends nights at home now.

6192355001234175 Rubin is tired. Dead tired. I can't help him with that. He'll either make it on his own... or not.
6192355001235151 Death can be stopped. A cure for sand plague exists. But how do I produce more than a few vials?
6192355001235152 Panacea
6192355001235153 The cure for sand pest. No side effects.
6192355001235154 Cures the sand pest with no side effects.
6192355001236753 Walked away from here on her own two feet. \nHer friend came for her. When she learned who her friend was, I think she decided to flee while you were distracted. To protect you, maybe.
6192355001236754 What friend?
6192355001236755 Go, Burakh. Murky is beyond your help now. You still don't get it.\nYou think with your fists. You don't understand life, or anything about this disease. How could you protect anyone, ignorant as you are?
6192355001236756 Who are you? You're not Clara. It's like you've been… changed.
6192355001236758 No tricks. I've stood here a while, listening in. You're all so funny, so fussy and serious.
6192355001236759 Spin that yarn elsewhere, little trickster. I could snap your neck.
6192355001236760 Quit buzzing around like a gnat and get to work!
6192355001236761 Where's Murky?
6192355001236762 Are you making fun of me? You just told me yourself…
6192355001236763 No, you can't. \nFirst, you swore an oath to never harm little tricksters. Second, I wouldn't let you. Third, I have plenty of necks to spare. Understand?
6192355001236764 I got it.
6192355001236765 No…
6192355001236766 I'm the real one. She is the impostor.
6192355001236767 Give Murky back! You hear me? You…
6192355001236768 I know more than you think.
6192355001236769 Ha. All right, so you're not entirely hopeless. Would you like to understand? You wanted to see Murky's friend—that, I can arrange.
6192355001236770 A life for a life, then?
6192355001236771 What's that supposed to mean?
6192355001236772 More traps? No, I'm not in the mood for games. Find another fool.
6192355001236773 …Are you angry with me?
6192355001236774 Very much so.
6192355001236785 No, kiddo. Of course I'm not.
6192355001236786 Are you feeling all right?
6192355001236787 Why did you leave without me?
6192355001236788 What is that supposed to mean? Why are you here?
6192355001236789 Will you forgive me?
6192355001236790 I'm not sure.
6192355001236791 I'm sorry.
6192355001236792 Don't "I'm sorry" me. What happened back there by the fire?
6192355001236793 It's not enough to be sorry.
6192355001236794 I was scared.
6192355001236795 All the more reason to stay close to me, not run off into the night.
6192355001236796 So? Have you met your friend?
6192355001236797 No. I got scared. I don't want to meet her anymore.
6192355001236798 Thank heavens…
6192355001236799 But you weren't scared to run around in the night alone?
6192355001236800 Like I have a choice…
6192355001236801 I'll just stay here for a while. And then I'll come home. To our home.
6192355001236802 All right, kiddo. Stay here if you need to. I'm… I'm happy you're alive and well.
6192355001236803 I expect to see you home in an hour.
6192355001236804 What is this place, Murky? Have you been living here long?
6192355001236805 Long? Always. This is… well, it's a boxcar. Broken, I guess. Useless.\nI used to dream that it'd attach to a train while I slept, and I'd wake up and see the sea.
6192355001236806 That's one bold dream. It'd take more than a night to get to the sea from here. More than a week, even.
6192355001236807 Aren't you scared here alone?
6192355001236808 I'm not alone at all.
6192355001236809 Oh… Please, no more weird friends. All right?
6192355001236810 Who is here with you, then?
6192355001236811 Guests visit, sometimes. They're not my friends—no one is—but they play next to the boxcar, and I watch through a crack, or from the roof.\nI also have Mother's doll.
6192355001236812 A doll… Well, that's something.
6192355001236813 Let's go home, kiddo. Get a bite to eat, or something.
6192355001236814 You won't ever be alone anymore.
6192355001236815 Come now… It's me who is sorry.
6192355001236834 Precisely. No separate rooms. No running water. No heat. No beds. \nAnd yes, it is spacious—vertically! I suppose Victor expects me to build eight-story bunk beds there? And add hanging ropes so that people from the upper layers can descend to the toilet?
6192355001236835 You should suggest that to the Kains, erdem. They'll appreciate your imagination. Building one's spirit, training their will, asking the perennial questions…
6192355001236836 They say you can tell who's infected immediately. That it shows.
6192355001236837 We don't know anything for certain yet… anything! The vaccine is a disaster… People are dropping like flies… Not a single patient recovered. Not a single one!
6192355001236838 I'm sorry.
6192355001236839 Questions, questions, questions… Always questions, never answers.
6192355001236840 I have a question for you too, erdem.
6192355001236843 An oak isn't felled in one stroke.
6192355001236844 
6192355001236845 
6192355001236846 
6192355001236847 
6192355001236848 By the way, what does "erdem" mean? Obviously it's a steppe word, but what's the translation? "Arrogant fool," maybe?
6192355001236849 No. It's a polite way to address a person of knowledge.
6192355001236850 All right. I'll leave you to it. Although, I think we're better off without an isolation ward at all.
6192355001237052 I need to administer painkillers to three more patients.
6192355001237951 Hot blood from the udurgh's Ear. A single drink replenishes you and restores health. But that's not why I need it.
6192355001237952 The only way to find out if this serum can cure the plague is to try it out.
6192355001237953 
6192355001237954 
6192355001237955 The strange blood from the Ear is invigorating, but if I drink it all, I won't have a sample anymore.
6192355001237956 I've used up all the underground blood. Nothing left to experiment with.
6192355001237957 
6192355001237958 
6192355001237959 I get anxious thinking about my kids… Are they faring all right in the Lair without me?
6192355001237960 Today, a bull will walk the Town's streets to touch it for the last time. Then it will be slaughtered.
6192355001237961 Aigul
6192355001238151 I need to administer painkillers to two more patients.
6192355001238152 I need to administer painkillers to one more patient.
6192355001239351 Changeling
6192355001239551 
6192355001239552 Audience
6192355001239563 Are you certain everyone on your list still lives?
6192355001239564 Yes.
6192355001239565 You two again?
6192355001239566 What list?
6192355001239567 Are you <i>very sure indeed</i> they live? Have you seen each one of them lately? Paid them a visit? You better watch out…
6192355001239568 Go home, brats.
6192355001239569 I keep track of everything.
6192355001239570 Do you keep many lists?
6192355001239571 Oh… you mean the one from my father's legacy. Yeah, I think so.
6192355001239572 I remember now. One list is enough.
6192355001239573 
6192355001240383 Clara
6192355001241451 "Erdem," "oynon," and "emshen" are the words people use for doctors.
6192355001241452 Sort of.
6192355001241453 So?
6192355001241454 Okay, don't laugh at me. Have you heard that five years ago, during the First Outbreak, kids made these—
6192355001241455 —horrible mixtures from ground pills, yes. "Shmowders." They can cure the plague.\nYes… I've heard. Worse, I've checked. So don't laugh at me either, dear colleague. What's the word… "erdem"?
6192355001241456 Holy shit… Sorry, excuse my language. So you've checked, then?
6192355001241457 I'm no erdem. "Emshen" would be more accurate… but not especially humble. Usually, we call surgeons "yargachins," as in butchers.
6192355001241458 You don't have to watch your tongue with me. Yes, I've checked. But if you wonder how it works, I don't know. I'm not a pharmacologist, and anyway, this place doesn't have a lab. If you ask me, it was ten thousand monkeys at a typewriter… Oh, I don't want to delve too deep into this. "There are more things in heaven and earth…"\nWhat we need is a process that follows the scientific method.
6192355001241459 Fair enough.
6192355001241460 All right, Burakh. Now's not the time for steppe linguistics… We'll talk later, colleague.
6192355001241461 Godspeed, oynon.
6192355001241462 If we meet again, that is.
6192355001241463 Pity. I wondered how that was possible… Thought you might know.
6192355001241464 ……
6192355001241465 I wonder what you've gotten yourself into, pal. Who did you dissect? You're so secretive, as though it was Simon's body! Heh. Now <i>that</i> would be a whole heap of trouble…
6192355001241466 ……
6192355001241467 All I know is that you couldn't have done anything low or selfish. I guess you tried to make a cure, too? A vaccine, or a serum? But why did you have to do it alone? Even I can't do everything on my own, and you…
6192355001241470 I'd search the houses next to the drugstore.
6192355001241471 What have you done to annoy the Kin so much? Robbed a grave? Whom did you take from them to provoke this hunt?
6192355001241472 Then again, it hardly matters now.
6192355001241475 Brilliant. I've waited so long to have an honest, heartfelt conversation with you, and now this. Oh Stakh, why must you always be so difficult?
6192355001241476 I could look after the sick. I'm not afraid of dirty work. But, actually, I have quite a few skills aside from mathematics.
6192355001241477 You are a brave woman. But looking after these patients… is pointless. They're all doomed.
6192355001241478 Like counting corpses? Fine work for a mathematician, in times like these.
6192355001241479 That doesn't mean they don't deserve care.
6192355001241480 True…
6192355001241481 But that would be a waste. A pointless sacrifice on your part. Suicide!
6192355001241482 I can sew, tie knots, tell stories, do card tricks, play cello, and repair equipment. Although, I doubt any of that would be useful here.\nUnfortunately, I can't walk around too much, on account of my leg.
6192355001241483 An impressive list.
6192355001241484 Still, you should go home now. There's nothing for you to do here.
6192355001241485 Such as?
6192355001241486 If that's irony I hear, It's misplaced. This is precisely the work I was tasked with at the Town Hall: statistics. Orderlies do the rounds and count the sick and dead, then I work with the data.
6192355001241487 Is that not enough for you?
6192355001241488 Sisyphean toil…
6192355001243851 We need to set up the facilities… An isolation ward, a real hospital… We need control over corpse disposal…\nTell me, how's it possible this town has never had a proper hospital? Don't women give birth here? Don't people get sick? I'm serious…
6192355001243852 We managed somehow. And no one complained.
6192355001245251 Murky
6192355001246451 Forget it, it's broken. Broken… They've destroyed water pumps all over the Town, the villains!\nThe Gorkhon water's foul, sure, but we don't drink it! What about washing, cleaning? It's fine when boiled. Cholera dies in boiled water.
6192355001246452 Who broke it?
6192355001246652 I helped one patient. Two to go.
6192355001246653 I helped two patients. At least one more is left.
6192355001247151 Kids have invented some way to "help me out."
6192355001248951 You know what, pal? Take this barrel to the cape, to Ravel's house.
6192355001248952 Huh? What for?
6192355001248953 For the good of the people.
6192355001249951 Cold Ones
6192355001251151 Burglar
6192355001251152 Burglar
6192355001251153 Hogger
6192355001251154 
6192355001251155 
6192355001251156 The urchins in the Warehouses say they've come up with some way to assist me. We'll… see about that.
6192355001251157 Notkin's Soul-and-a-Halves chart the infected areas on a daily basis. Those little blockheads! Still, a map might be useful…
6192355001251163 Father is dead. Oyun doesn't desire power. The Kin have two leaders now: Overseer Tycheek and Sahba.
6192355001251164 
6192355001251165 
6192355001251166 Tycheek's daughter, Taya, might still be alive. She's upstairs somewhere.
6192355001251167 
6192355001251351 Did you see who it was?
6192355001251352 Who?
6192355001251353 What did you play?
6192355001251354 I didn't see anyone.
6192355001251355 It was Mother's favorite melody. Her favorite. I think she wrote it herself. No one else could have learned it. Because she only played it for me, and no one else. Ever. Not even for Brother.
6192355001251356 So what?
6192355001251358 It's Liszt.
6192355001251359 That's the thing. It wasn't me.
6192355001251360 Who was it, then?
6192355001251361 Does it matter, though?
6192355001251362 I hear this melody often. I walk down the street and it comes from a window, or from a backyard, an attic, a cellar… I chase the sound, trying to locate the source. \nI always find the piano, lid raised. Someone has been there. But there's no one. No matter how hard I call.
6192355001251363 Mysterious.
6192355001251364 Someone must have overheard the melody. They're playing a trick on you.
6192355001251365 It's driving me mad. I've walked the whole Town back and forth, I've worn three pairs of shoes to rags, do you understand? Three, I'm serious. \nI wander at night, hoping to hear her, hoping to find whoever plays her melody. Who could know Mother so well? I won't believe it was <i>her…</i>
6192355001251366 Why?
6192355001251367 Well, I've heard the music too. So if it honestly weren't you...
6192355001251368 Well, because it's cruel. Believing that the souls of the dead still walk among us… is cruel towards them, don't you think? They deserve better.
6192355001251369 I guess.
6192355001251370 I don't believe in the immortal soul.
6192355001251371 What if it really <i>was</i> her spirit? Would that mean there is no death after all? But that's not even the point…\nI need to know for sure. Any answer would be a gift. It was her music, after all… Our music. If it's just some person playing, some person who was close to Mother, how could they do such a thing to me?
6192355001251372 It definitely is a person. One day, you'll catch them.
6192355001251373 If I ever hear this melody again, I'll try to figure it out.
6192355001251374 Why? Who would do something like this?
6192355001251375 I don't know.
6192355001251376 Does it matter?
6192355001251377 Why do you stare at me like that?
6192355001251378 It was a person, after all.
6192355001251379 It wasn't a person.
6192355001251380 …Who was it, then? I want to talk to them.
6192355001251381 Whoa! You <i>are</i> Big Vlad's daughter after all. That steel in your voice! It was Clara. The girl who—
6192355001251382 Just a random worker.
6192355001251383 Some little girl.
6192355001251384 How did you know?
6192355001251385 The musician was possessed.
6192355001251386 A girl who played told me.
6192355001251387 The piano kept playing music even when no one was in the room.
6192355001251388 —I know who Clara is.
6192355001251389 I don't think you do.
6192355001251390 You tasked her with the same errand, right?
6192355001251391 In that case… it means there's nothing after death. I see.
6192355001251392 I'm sorry.
6192355001251393 I'm not sure it's that simple.
6192355001251394 And the melody? How does he know it?
6192355001251395 I've no idea. He didn't seem like the sharpest tool in the shed.
6192355001251396 It's odd. He didn't understand it, either. He was frightened.
6192355001251397 What does she know about Mother?
6192355001251398 She mostly made fun of me. Didn't learn much.
6192355001251399 She said she was also looking for the ghost who played piano.
6192355001251400 So it <i>was</i> Mother. So she is still here. So there is still hope.
6192355001251401 You don't look relieved.
6192355001251402 I'm happy for you.
6192355001251403 I'm happy for your mother.
6192355001251404 Death brought no solace to her, then.
6192355001251405 Impossible.
6192355001251406 Whatever you say…
6192355001251552 Have you spoken to the girl? How is she?
6192355001251553 I think it's better to leave her alone for now.
6192355001251554 I came to take her away. The Town Hall is finally ready to find her a normal place to live.
6192355001251651 Can I help you somehow?
6192355001251653 No. Not now…\nThough, can you tell me what's going on with your water delivery system? Is it true the water's only for industrial purposes? Seriously…
6192355001251654 I don't know. We didn't have all this infrastructure back when I left. All the water was brought in from steppe springs.
6192355001251655 Gorkhon water is unsuitable for drinking. The Abattoir's too close.
6192355001251656 Why do you ask?
6192355001251657 No reason… Hopefully those are only silly rumors.\nForget it, Burakh. I have a splitting headache. If you have no urgent business, then we'll talk later. Later, later… Qui non proficit, deficit.
6192355001251658 Fair enough. Good luck, emshen.
6192355001251659 Be oylgono үgyb…
6192355001251660 Yes, Burakh?
6192355001251661 What's going on with the water, emshen?
6192355001251662 Why are the water barrels being guarded?
6192355001251663 One well-wisher came here today, reporting that someone infected the water barrels in the Middle Town.\nCertainly, it'd be nice to investigate. But when am I supposed to do that? How many barrels are in that area? Twenty? Thirty?
6192355001251664 But what if we do find an infected barrel?
6192355001251665 Overriding my authority, Saburov issued an order: All barrels in the Middle Town are to be destroyed. Those are his people guarding them… And, well, I'm powerless to challenge his orders.
6192355001251666 Why only the Middle Town?
6192355001251667 I've received samples from the Upper and Lower Town. All clear.\nAnd the Middle Town is clear, too! It's all nonsense. An idiotic craze, a crowd mad with paranoia! I have too much to do to go chasing shadows…
6192355001251668 But I thought…
6192355001251669 Burakh.
6192355001251670 The issue with the water keeps bothering me…
6192355001251671 No. No… For god's sake… Damn it! What have we done to deserve…\n…All right. I apologize for that outburst. Leave it to me. I'll examine it. Today… It won't take long.
6192355001251672 …And if it's infected?
6192355001251673 What?
6192355001251674 No… Nothing.
6192355001251677 I made a mistake. But it's my concern, not yours.
6192355001251678 What's this? Where did you get it?
6192355001251679 Something's wrong with this water.
6192355001251680 From a barrel in the Middle Town.
6192355001251681 Yup. That's my name.
6192355001251682 And a grave one.
6192355001251683 As in…?
6192355001251684 I know that. But what's the plan?
6192355001251686 "Water carriers"? Seriously, Burakh? We're quarantined! Although, I suppose we'll have to send someone—with proper security, of course…\nWhere, by the way, are those springs? Far from here?
6192355001251687 Quite. Still, erdem, about the water…
6192355001251688 It'll take them roughly three days to fetch the water.
6192355001251689 Water will now be given to people drop by drop, in a controlled fashion.\nSome luddites destroyed your water pipes tonight. Claimed it was contaminated by the river water. Granted, the Gorkhon <i>is</i> terribly polluted… but what if there was no contamination? Where are we supposed to get water now? For sanitary use, if nothing else…
6192355001251690 So those guards simply protect the barrels from the common people? To stop them from taking too much?
6192355001251691 There is talk of infected barrels…
6192355001251692 Drivel. I don't believe it for a second.
6192355001251693 Who started the rumor?
6192355001251694 There are steppe springs. Water carriers bring water from there.
6192355001251695 Fewer.
6192355001251697 But you could check them.
6192355001251698 But what if it's true?
6192355001252352 Yulia Liuricheva
6192355001252353 Mark Immortell
6192355001252354 Peter Stamatin
6192355001252355 Her questions are madness!\n<i>What</i> numbers? My work schedule… Who I'd like to be rid of… I'm an ordinary person—why ask me? I live a good life, I'm a productive member of the community, I've never hurt anyone…
6192355001252356 What did she say?
6192355001252357 Ugh. I guess I was lucky this time. I'm a good person! A good person…
6192355001252358 You're only realizing it now?
6192355001252359 But I've got kids… kids! These hands work to feed them both. I teach them to be good.
6192355001252360 What did you discuss?
6192355001252363 She has a stump of an imagination. Not that she lacks it completely, you know? She's not talentless. That's what stings the worst.\nThe inquisition only takes the talented. They look for children with potential, and then teach them… to look for openings.
6192355001252364 So you know the Inquisitor personally?
6192355001252365 If Peter were still alive, I'd drop that hideous Cathedral on her head for him. But now…
6192355001252366 You wouldn't even spare the Cathedral?
6192355001252367 I only hope the bitch doesn't touch Brother.
6192355001252368 Well… Perhaps she'll appreciate that you came to her voluntarily.
6192355001253555 …Eighty percent or so. Eighty-five if she's been to the Capital in May. Could have been even higher, but that bird story…
6192355001253556 Is that the probability of execution, or salvation?
6192355001253557 They're often indistinguishable from one another.
6192355001253558 Do you know her?
6192355001253559 Oh, so you've been invited to this performance, too?
6192355001253560 You mean the gallows? Reckon we'll spectate—or go on stage?
6192355001254051 All the world's a stage. Sometimes a gallows stage.\nI foresee a unique experience. We are about to witness a most exquisite one-woman show. I suggest you keep track of it, and learn her devices. It'll come in handy.
6192355001254052 Are inquisitors actors?
6192355001254053 Absolutely. Her role is difficult, though, so do play along. Improvise. Drop a brick or two, derail her with your silly trains of thought—you know the drill.
6192355001254054 That was a compliment so backhanded I could see through it.
6192355001254451 The bull is sacrificed at the Ragi Barrow. If I want to be there, I need to arrive before dawn.
6192355001254452 I'm a surgeon, not a butcher. My job is helping people, not cutting beef.
6192355001254453 Olkho-o
6192355001254454 Bulls don't get sand pest. Why?\n\nAlthough, to be honest, I care much less about the <i>why</i> then about the <i>how.</i> How can I use it, if at all? A puzzle that can only be solved with a microscope.
6192355001254455 The udurgh's ear is in an abandoned steppe village—whatever that means. Time to whisper in it.
6192355001254456 Seems like the dark cloud hangs over Alexander today, not Katerina.
6192355001254457 
6192355001254458 
6192355001254459 
6192355001254460 
6192355001254461 
6192355001254462 
6192355001254463 
6192355001254464 One Kindred attacked me first. Three are left.
6192355001254465 Three more steppe people are standing watch over Stakh at the Warehouses.\n
6192355001254466 Two more Kindred are waiting for Stakh at the Warehouses.
6192355001254467 One more Kindred is standing watch over Stakh at the Warehouses.
6192355001254468 Damn… I took care of everyone who was threatening Stakh. He's free to do whatever he pleases today. \n\nI hope he uses this opportunity to go home and get decent sleep.
6192355001254469 They were camping on Rubin's doorstep again.\n\nI did not wait to see what they were planning to do. They're done for.
6192355001254693 What do you plan to do about us, kheerkhen?
6192355001254694 Now is not the time for love.
6192355001254695 There is no "us." There's me, and there's you. Deal with your life yourself.
6192355001254696 …What makes you think I love you?
6192355001254697 Then why are you following me?
6192355001254698 Well…
6192355001254699 Baygalday, you're breaking my heart… if only that were true! You don't even know how cruel your words are.
6192355001254700 You are an Herb Bride. Betrothed to the Earth, not to men. You're not a creature of love…
6192355001254701 Ugh. Spare me.
6192355001254702 You know full well we're not the kind who love. It's not about love at all, khөөrkhen. I'd rather live than love.
6192355001254703 Live, then. No one's stopping you.
6192355001254704 So what's your actual name?
6192355001254705 Why do you ask? You'll remember it yourself, when the time comes.
6192355001254706 Fair enough.
6192355001254707 You're a good dancer, Bride. Bayarlaa to you for the good harvest.
6192355001254708 I've decided that I won't bother you anymore.
6192355001254709 Thank heavens…
6192355001254710 Can you <i>please</i> tell me your name now?
6192355001254711 Where's the bull?
6192355001254712 What matters is, you got used to me. Now, you won't be so scared when the time comes. It will be easier for you. So have no regrets.
6192355001254713 When what time comes?
6192355001254714 I'm tired of your riddles. What do you want?
6192355001254715 Scared of what? I'm not afraid of you, and I doubt I ever will be.
6192355001254716 Be khara, he went into the steppe. He said he'll be back.
6192355001254717 "He said…" Wait, today?
6192355001254718 Yamar berkhe!
6192355001254719 Don't worry, khөөrkhen. Your booha will return. Unlike me.
6192355001254720 Listen… whatsyername…
6192355001254721 Good.
6192355001254722 Nara. <i>Narana.</i> So you don't remember me at all?
6192355001254723 Nara… Nara… No. I don't.
6192355001254724 You're an Herb Bride. Earth's flesh. I never had much contact with your kind.
6192355001254725 You will have to kill me at some point. I told you—I'm yours, yargachin.
6192355001254726 What?!
6192355001254727 You know what? If I ever see you again, I sure will. Now oshysh daa, be on your way, basaghan!
6192355001254728 Are you sure you want to know?
6192355001254729 Yeah, yeah. Tell me already.
6192355001254730 Honestly? Not really.
6192355001254731 Don't be sad, and don't be frightened when it happens. We do not fear death. Tiimel daa, we're indifferent to it. But it will help you understand.
6192355001254732 I think I understand now.
6192355001254733 So that's what our connection is…
6192355001254734 Let someone else kill you. Ask the Worms, maybe. Murder comes naturally to them.
6192355001254735 You cut me wrong. You're opening the spleen. But it's too early.
6192355001254736 I'm cutting you right. Bear with me and be quiet.
6192355001254737 [cut down and to the right]
6192355001254738 You won't see the future this way.
6192355001254739 I know the future already. I'm looking for different answers now.
6192355001254740 [cut up]
6192355001254741 There is no pain,  khөөrkhen. You are yargachin. What your blade cuts is not a body. You're tracing emptiness. A predestined Line.
6192355001254742 [cut down]
6192355001254743 [cut left]
6192355001254744 Did you find it?
6192355001254745 Almost. I can almost see why you people, who devour meat raw, are unaffected by this disease.
6192355001254746 [cut right]
6192355001254747 We love you, yargachin. You're doing everything right.\nYou're getting closer now… Soon we become whole with you. A Kharanghe…
6192355001254748 Who were you in life? Did you dance with Earth?
6192355001254749 [cut up]
6192355001254750 Can't you see? I'm dancing with Earth now.\nYou're cutting me open so that Earth may live. This is how it's been since ancient times. \nYou're doing everything right. I'm so thankful…
6192355001255551 [cut up]
6192355001255552 [keep cutting left]
6192355001255553 It hurts! Zobo, zobo, unente, aaaah! It hurts!!
6192355001255554 [keep cutting]
6192355001255555 [change direction, cut up]
6192355001255556 Why do they do it? Why do they build such unbearable towns?\nThe Earth doesn't want this town. It's killing her like you're killing me now.
6192355001255557 I'm not killing you. You're still alive.
6192355001255558 [cut down]
6192355001255559 What do you see?
6192355001255560 Earth. It's… she's breathing.
6192355001255561 [cut up]
6192355001255562 I'm made of Earth.
6192355001255563 No. You're made of flesh, like a normal person.
6192355001255564 [cut down]
6192355001255565 I'll be alive afterwards, too. My blood will trickle down into the Earth, and I will become an herb. I hope it's swevery…
6192355001255566 [cut straight]
6192355001255567 [cut down]
6192355001255568 This <i>is</i> earth. Earth is flesh. Hot blood flows through it. It gives birth, gets sick, endures, and suffers.\nWe are flesh of the Earth's flesh, yargachin. And so is the disease killing you. But it's of no danger to us while we're connected to the Earth.\nNow you've seen it.
6192355001255569 Yes.
6192355001255570 [cut up]
6192355001255571 Do you see it? What do you see?
6192355001255572 It… it does look like Earth. What is it?
6192355001255573 It's beautiful.
6192355001255574 Nara
6192355001255751 I'm sorry about your loss. Still, think bright thoughts. Earth takes her due, but gives in kind.\nHave you now remembered me? Do you remember our connection?
6192355001255752 Ah. It's you, basaghan.
6192355001255753 Your dress is even more torn than before. You danced with all your energy, huh?
6192355001255754 I needed to make Earth split open. To lay your father to rest.
6192355001255755 I see…
6192355001255756 Bayarlaa. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.
6192355001255757 I'm all yours, kheerkhen.
6192355001255758 What is your name?
6192355001255759 I've no need for such gifts.
6192355001255760 So you don't remember at all?
6192355001255761 No. I honestly don't.
6192355001255762 You know? I don't believe you. I feel like this is all some sort of a prank. Or game, maybe.
6192355001255763 This is what you told me once: "I often dream of salt. Either its taste, or color, or whole salt pits, or holding some in my pinched fingers." Do you believe me now?
6192355001255764 Wait… It can't be!
6192355001255765 I never told anyone about it. Even my friends. Even Lara doesn't know.
6192355001255766 Baarkhane, baarkhane… Forget Lara… That's not why I'm following you.
6192355001255767 Why then?
6192355001255768 Ene shee yuun khun gheeshebshe… But you're not heartless, however cruel. I won't leave you. I hold no grudge against you.\nJust mind this: When you finally remember; when you realize why you need me, do not hold a grudge, either. Promise?
6192355001255769 I'm not the type to hold grudges.
6192355001255770 I can't promise anything.
6192355001255771 Don't send me away. We are bound, you and I. I am yours. Remember that, at least.
6192355001255772 Yamar berkhe basaghan bai! I couldn't forget even if I tried...
6192355001255773 Don't try to bind me. I told you already, I don't need you.
6192355001255774 All right. I'll remember.
6192355001255793 Finally, we're back together. I've been waiting for you, Burakh. Will you have me now?
6192355001255794 Who are you?
6192355001255795 You mistook me for someone else, basaghan.
6192355001255796 Wait… I seem to recognize your face.
6192355001255797 Don't you remember me, kholboön? Well, I remember you. And I remember your words. So, will you have me now?
6192355001255798 You are an Herb Bride. We can't have a relationship.
6192355001255799 You have a very clear speech for a Bride. Do you live in the Town?
6192355001255800 Your hands are so heavy. Shh, don't touch me yet. Or else the dress will tear, and it's no good.\nThe tears in the dress must appear on their own, during the dance. Just like the Earth is torn apart when it releases herbs.
6192355001255801 I'm not touching you.
6192355001255802 Relax, I'll be careful. I'm just checking if you're real.
6192355001255803 So, will you have me now? Will we be joined forever?
6192355001255804 But… Who are you?
6192355001255805 No, basaghan. Something is off about you. What do you really want?
6192355001255806 Were we… lovers?
6192355001255807 Fine. I'll wait for you to remember me. We'll meet again soon. I'll find you.\nFor now, try to remember who I am, kholboön. Segne dehe, or there'll be trouble.
6192355001255808 Don't worry.
6192355001255809 I will wait for you, basaghan.
6192355001255810 You are beautiful.
6192355001257351 Living Blood
6192355001257352 This is special blood. I can make special medicine from it.
6192355001257353 Any trickle of blood seeps from Olonngo. This is the blood I was looking for. One vial is enough to seriously invigorate myself or brew someone salvation.
6192355001257451 Murky's not in the Lair. I think there's an abandoned train car she stays in sometimes. Maybe she's there?
6192355001257452 Murky's fine. Thank heavens.
6192355001257453 
6192355001257454 
6192355001257455 
6192355001257456 
6192355001257457 
6192355001257458 
6192355001257459 
6192355001257460 Murky is dead.
6192355001257461 Murky's not in the Lair. I think there's an abandoned train car she stays in sometimes. Maybe she's there?
6192355001257462 Murky. My sunshine. You're fine…
6192355001257463 
6192355001257464 
6192355001257465 Where's Murky?
6192355001257466 Day Four,\nin which the Theatre observes a full house.
6192355001257467 Day Five,\nin which the Haruspex fully embraces the struggle of invention, and a sacrifice is offered.
6192355001257468 Day Six,\nin which the answers reveal themselves if the Haruspex is brave enough not to seek them.
6192355001257469 Day Seven,\nin which new actors enter the stage, and the old ones reveal themselves in unexpected ways.
6192355001257470 Day Eight,\nin which the Haruspex finally realizes how deep the rifts go.
6192355001257471 Day Nine,\nin which new blood is injected into the Town, disturbing the old.
6192355001257472 Day Ten,\nin which the plague finally stops playing to lose.
6192355001257473 Day Eleven,\nin which the Haruspex looks for the courier.
6192355001257474 Day Twelve,\nin which the lights die out.
6192355001257851 Unfortunately, some diseases don't.
6192355001257852 But it's not cholera we're dealing with.
6192355001257853 Hell if I know! People have turned to wolves now, packs of wolves. Some destroy water pumps, others look for the carrier; some stock up on kerosene, planning to burn houses… Everyone has their own truth.\nI also heard of a suicidal tagloor. They don't wait for death… too scared.
6192355001257854 What tagloor?
6192355001257855 Huh.
6192355001257858 Well, it's like a community… a steppe word. I don't know the details.
6192355001257859 Wrong. A "tagloor" are a group of people who share a common fate.
6192355001257860 I know what a tagloor is. What you describe is psychosis.
6192355001257861 Well, if you don't know the details, stop spreading rumors. And drink from the Gullet or the Guzzle. The water is better there.
6192355001257862 Orders.
6192355001257863 Because I told you to.
6192355001257864 Eh? And who deserves this treasure, I wonder? For what service?\nNo way in hell! My orders are clear. If the water is clear, it's precious. A bottle per day. For everyone. The Committee's orders. And it's just fair, too.
6192355001257865 All right, all right… Whatever you say.
6192355001257866 It was a test. Well done.
6192355001257867 Rumor is, steppe people infected the barrels last night. Don't take offense, sir! Might also have been the plague-bearer, the bone-legged wench. \nRemember the hunt for her? Well, where there's smoke, there's fire. Guess there was a good reason behind the hunt, after all.
6192355001257868 You've lived long enough to have wrinkles, yet you still believe someone would infect people on purpose?
6192355001257869 So the Kin is to blame for everything? Great. Go on, tell me more. I'm all ears.
6192355001257870 What a lady… Always up to all sorts of mischief, despite the bone legs!
6192355001257873 Don't make fun of me, doctor. You live to my age, you'll sing a different tune.\nEven the professor from the Capital, a book smart man, isn't laughing anymore. He realizes now our traditions should be respected. Yeah… You don't have to believe them deep down, but show some respect.
6192355001257874 So what does that professor of yours say?
6192355001257875 If you don't believe it, who are you protecting the barrel from?
6192355001257876 Oh, I don't! But an order came through this morning, barrels must be guarded—as many as we have manpower to guard. Tough that the Master is the only one with enough free men…\nMaybe it's to protect the water from someone infecting it, too. Can't be too sure.
6192355001257877 What would be the point, if it's already infected?
6192355001257878 I've been told to stand guard here, 'cause those are our last sips of clear water. The water pipes were destroyed last night. The fools decided the infection's waterborne, from the Gorkhon.\nIt's polluted, true, with blood and innards from the Abattoir.
6192355001257879 The Gorkhon flows in the opposite direction!
6192355001257880 Master's orders. Very thoughtful of him. And Saburov issued an order, too. One bottle per person, and not a drop more.
6192355001257881 Doing your best to drive everyone nuts, aren't you?
6192355001257882 Sounds right. Dying of thirst is better than dying of sand pest. Less tortuous.
6192355001257883 Sounds bad… So now what?
6192355001257884 An order's been issued: all barrels are to be examined. If anything suspicious is found, all barrels from that part of town are to be seized. Can't be too sure.\nBachelor Dankovsky is in charge of the process. It's all up to him. Hence my question: Did he send you to inspect the barrels?
6192355001257888 It's growing colder. Have you noticed?
6192355001257889 There was a water pump by your house. I fixed it. You have water now.
6192355001257890 I haven't had a minute of rest. I suppose the running around warms me.
6192355001257891 Cub, that water's only good for washing floors. It's from the river. It reeks of the Abattoir!
6192355001257892 It's from the tributaries—the Gullet and the Guzzle. The water there is less polluted, because it comes from the steppe.
6192355001257893 It does <i>not.</i> It's normal water.
6192355001257894 Those fools destroyed the pumps on impulse, of course. But where else could the disease have come from, if not the Abattoir? Think about it.\nHonestly, I'm surprised you and Dankovsky haven't turned that place upside down already! Even that girl, Clara, mentioned the Abattoir…
6192355001257895 Fine. You'll have your barrel.
6192355001257896 Oh, I'll definitely go there at some point.
6192355001257897 I understand, yes. Without fresh water, we're all doomed.
6192355001257898 There's a water pump next to your house. Want me to fix it?
6192355001257899 I need drinking water. Lots of it. Pumps really aren't a good source, Cub… Whatever they say, now is not the time to take risks.
6192355001257900 How much is "lots"?
6192355001257901 Oh, nonsense! I don't believe in imaginary poisoners!
6192355001257902 But what if it's true?
6192355001257905 I know perfectly well who started this silly rumor! It's just muddy water. And I need it desperately, Cub! For the people!
6192355001257906 It's dangerous…
6192355001257909 Oh, it's not so bad! Unlike dying of thirst.
6192355001257910 Lara!
6192355001257911 What next? Shall we become terrified of one another? Too anxious to eat bread? We can't succumb to fear, Cub! The disease isn't the worst part of an outbreak.
6192355001257912 What is?
6192355001257913 The way people transform! Don't let fear overtake you! Fear is the worst disease. It weakens your spirit and welcomes illness!
6192355001257916 No. I mean… Yes, it would be nice of you, but that's not what I need.
6192355001257917 Why?
6192355001257918 Actually, I fixed the water pump next to your house. You're all set.
6192355001257919 Oh, but listen! Thank you, Cub, that was very thoughtful, but… it's not enough.
6192355001257920 Why?
6192355001257921 Oh. I thought you'd appreciate it.
6192355001257922 I'll need water. Plenty of water. Get me a barrel, Cub, please! Have it delivered here. You're a doctor. You have special authority.
6192355001257923 So I'll, what, drag it here? I'm not a draft horse.
6192355001257924 But you said yourself they're guarded. No one would just give me one.
6192355001257925 Still, don't drink from that barrel. All right?
6192355001257926 Who started it?
6192355001257927 The idiots who hunt for the bone-legged carrier! Or was she clay-legged? What's her name…
6192355001257928 Shabnak-adyg.
6192355001257929 Yes, exactly. A shabnak-adyg. Do you seriously want me to deny people water because of a fairy tale?
6192355001257930 Lara! It's risky! Think straight!
6192355001257931 Lara, I need you alive!
6192355001257932 I never could beat you in an argument.
6192355001257933 It's dangerous!
6192355001257934 Whatever. Do as you want…
6192355001257935 Death favors the bold… Fear is a natural shield.
6192355001257936 Fine. Share this water with your guests. But you, yourself, will drink only what is distributed in bottles. Got it?
6192355001257937 So?
6192355001257938 It didn't work out. I'm sorry, Gravel.
6192355001257939 You won't receive a clean barrel. Everyone is equal when it comes to the threat of thirst, homeless or not.
6192355001257940 …Are you implying there were unclean barrels, too?
6192355001257941 Yes. Bringing you one of those obviously would have been a disservice.
6192355001257942 No. Just a slip of the tongue. Forget it.
6192355001257943 This can't be true…
6192355001257944 Dankovsky determined it was.
6192355001257945 Seems like it.
6192355001257946 This means someone <i>deliberately</i> spreads the disease. Please be careful with that plan of yours, Gravel. Don't let in strangers, not anymore.
6192355001257947 That's fine, I'll live…
6192355001257948 Screaming through the walls? Why?
6192355001257949 I guess they're bored, too. I'd also like to scream, but I don't! I want to, but I'm silent. I want to cry, yet I laugh. I'm inside-out girl!
6192355001257950 Well, it's good you're safe in here. But I guess your people are unhappy? They want to go outside?

6192355001262553 Lara wants to turn her Shelter into a... well, shelter for the homeless. To do that, she needs a personal water barrel.\n\nOnly no one would let me just take it. I think this will require cunning.
6192355001262554 No barrel for Lara. Or for the rest of the Middle Town…
6192355001262555 Lara has the barrel, but I still have a sample of muddy water.
6192355001262556 Very much so. If I wasn't alive, who would be superior to everyone else here, I wonder?
6192355001262557 Seriously. Say, kid, do you know who, or what, an "udurgh" is?
6192355001262751 You are to call me like they did on the outside: Mother Superior. That's 'cause I'm better than everyone.
6192355001262752 Yes, Your Highness.
6192355001262753 Yamar berkhe basaghan bai! That's one smart girl!
6192355001262754 Ime beshe, it is not.
6192355001262755 Strawberry… It's a nice white berry. I saw it when I was in the Tower. It smells so yummy!\nAnd raspberry. It can also be red or white, but in truth, it's yellow. Yamar goe bee, so pretty! So tasty!
6192355001262756 Don't think I can manage that. This town's never seen any strawberries or raspberries.
6192355001262757 Never eaten those. I've only seen them in books.
6192355001262758 You're surprisingly eloquent. As though you grew up in the Town.
6192355001262759 A wish… Well, I only have one…
6192355001262760 A wish… Well, I only have one…
6192355001262761 Be kharanab, you're a smart girl. Stay here for now. Wait some more.
6192355001262762 Bayartay, Your Superiorness. See you.
6192355001268553 It's not like you can stop us anyway. We have no plans to fit on our hands. If you don't take it, another doctor will. A less squeamish one.
6192355001268554 Why do you have to be so stubborn...
6192355001268555 You won't hold us all back.
6192355001268556 Fine. Have it your way. Here's the deal then: I'll bring you protective medicine, enough for a couple of kids. And they'll be the only ones doing the scouting. Is that clear?

6192355001274053 Here's what I think. From now on, you will have a small additional burden—maybe not even a burden at all. A trifle, really.
6192355001274054 Well?
6192355001274057 Hunger comes into play.
6192355001274058 Meaning?
6192355001274059 The actor goes out into the Town, searching for inspiration, a role. "He walks down his paths." That's what you're about to do.
6192355001274060 Why do this in the Town? Why not here in the Theatre, where you can see?
6192355001274061 Your burden is heavy, Artemy Burakh. How can we show that?\nImagine rolling a boulder uphill, muscles trembling. What do you feel?
6192355001274062 Unbearable exhaustion. Even without the boulder…
6192355001274067 A question for the ages, poignant in every generation: How can death be overcome? In our play, it's achieved by dividing a person.
6192355001274068 What do you mean?
6192355001274069 Well. If you're a surgeon, your sense of touch must be very keen.\nWhat is this item? What is it <i>about?</i> What's its point? It's warm, slippery, quite heavy, smells of dampness and blood. What is it?
6192355001274070 A liver.
6192355001274071 The next thing I'm taking from you is hope. Simple as that.
6192355001274072 Aren't you going a bit too far?
6192355001274073 Hunger, dear Burakh. This time, it's hunger again. In case the first limit seemed too lenient to you.
6192355001274074 It didn't.
6192355001274077 You know how it works, right? You are Artemy Burakh. Finish your story and try not to die.
6192355001274078 Please help me understand. It's absurd. You're making it easier and easier for me to die, while my goal is to overcome death. Meaning, <i>not die.</i> It's a contradiction.
6192355001274079 Exhaustion. Exhaustion again.
6192355001274080 Yeah… exhaustion again.
6192355001274083 You're holding props, but I want to see real objects. Things turn to dry cotton wool in your hands—I want to see them alive.
6192355001274084 But I'm not an actor. I'm just speaking with you out of curiosity.
6192355001274091 Hunger. It's hunger again.\n<i>Gave a cry of lamentation,\nGave a scream of pain and famine…</i>
6192355001274092 …
6192355001274095 I may be mistaken, but it looks like you're just playing puppeteer.\nThat's it, right? People are just puppets to you. Dolls. Admit it. You haven't learned anything, have you?
6192355001274096 I'm a student of a certain famous director…
6192355001280753 I <i>have</i> made a cure. A couple hours ago.
6192355001280754 An hour ago, I was brought a vial and a letter from one Stanislav Rubin. He claims the medicine is a tested serum—<i>the</i> serum—and that the Town owes its existence to you. Any comment?
6192355001280755 It can't be… He doesn't have the skill.
6192355001280756 …So that's what he was doing!
6192355001280757 I don't deserve the honor.

6192355001288964 What's wrong with you, emshen?
6192355001288965 One's as bad as the other… and the other, and the other. One thinks he's a head above the rest, but loses heart. The other's light on his feet, but turns a blind eye to everything that matters. And none of you can save everyone.\nPlay it as you like. I'll be the one who cleans up your mess after, anyway.
6192355001288966 I never volunteered to be the first. You're welcome to go on stage yourself.
6192355001288967 There. I've reaped my harvest. Off we go, the two of us… into the wider world. We're inseparable now, my Fellow Traveler.
6192355001288968 Where are we going, exactly?
6192355001288969 Something's wrong. I'm in the Theatre again. Why? What does it mean for me?

6192355001305554 They won't tell me talk to the courier until I patch up the bandit. Or force my way through…
6192355001305555 Time to talk to the courier.

6192355001310073 The trap is shut. This noose will strangle you and Aglaya both, unless you flee.\n\nA new pantomime is being rehearsed at the Theatre.\n\nInfected over the past 24 hours: 434 people.\nGone missing: 481 people.\nCommitted suicide: 36 people.\n\nOverall death toll: 13539 people.\n\nThey shut down the Fund. They shut down the Hospital. There’s no one left to save.
6192355001311551 Name and occupation.
6192355001311552 Artemy Burakh, doctor.
6192355001311553 Oh… a doctor.\nOn General Block's orders, the local public fund will now be managed by the military. Take your payment as usual. Equal shares for everyone.
6192355001311554 You're the last people who should be managing this.
6192355001311555 A surgeon from the hospital. I came to get my pay.
6192355001312951 There is a schism in the Kin. Apostates run rampant in the Termitary. To restore the Kin, the gangrene must be cut off…\n\nNo… There must be another way.
6192355001312952 What do they want from you? A deed, I know. What deed?
6192355001312953 They want blood, not deeds. They always do!
6192355001312954 I could return to the Termitary and show the Kin my strength. But I believe there is another way, a path of patience and wisdom.\n\nPerhaps I'll soon see a way to reconcile the Kin with themselves.
6192355001312956 
6192355001312957 
6192355001312958 
6192355001312959 I've seen the Kin's guts. I know now how to touch the apostates' hearts and convince them to come back.
6192355001312960 The schism is no more. Time to speak with the Kin.
6192355001312961 
6192355001312962 
6192355001312963 They say that true men are either obeyed, or hated. Thanks to Father, some follow our family, while others dream of ripping out our throats, in his words.\nWhat is dignity, Master Burakh?
6192355001312964 Self-hatred.
6192355001312965 Did you come to gawk? That's all right… all right… Here I stand. I stood my ground this whole life… and I'll stand now. Fate has robbed me of my wife and children, and now… well…\nI wonder what my old age will be like… Yes. But you haven't left me… I know you haven't…
6192355001312966 Your wife…
6192355001313851 Officer
6192355001314251 A herbal infusion. Drink to reveal places and events hidden from naked eyes.
6192355001314252 This herbal infusion reveals places and events hidden from naked eyes. But the town is currently quiet. I should try later.
6192355001314351 
6192355001314352 Dora
6192355001314451 We're having an important conversation. The most important conversation of our lives, maybe. Can you leave us alone?
6192355001314452 What are you talking about?
6192355001314851 I've found one survivor. Several more to go.
6192355001314852 I've found two survivors.
6192355001314853 I've found three survivors.
6192355001315051 Yulia Liuricheva
6192355001315053 Yulia Liuricheva
6192355001315851 It was a pathologic change in many lives, mine included. It filled me to the brim.
6192355001315852 What…?
6192355001315853 According to a certain treatise on war, each type of terrain requires a particular approach. If there's a mountain ahead, a river to the right, starvation to the left, and the foe ahead, the terrain is called "desperate."\nThe treatise gives only one piece of advice on overcoming it: Fight.
6192355001315854 Makes sense.
6192355001315855 We're wasting years copying what already existed, and have no time to add anything original on top.
6192355001315856 That's a shame.
6192355001315857 It feels wrong for me to make confessions.
6192355001315858 No pressure.
6192355001315859 I'll have you know we used to want to change the world. And perhaps we did, a bit… But lately, it seems to me that all we're doing is trying to translate someone's childhood traumas and dreams.\nWake that child up, and it all evaporates.
6192355001315860 What do you mean?
6192355001315861 It's a capricious child. Every day, it demands more strength and attention than I could possibly have. Yet every minute spent on it is repaid in spades! I feel like I'm about to burst.\nIt stole my time, but gave me a family.
6192355001315862 Cheers…?
6192355001315863 i constantly feel like a messenger who is to be shot for bringing bad news
6192355001315864 …
6192355001315865 head deep in the second outbreak\ni feel like i've grasped the idea of death\nextracted its essence, that is present in the living too\nnow i need to write my observations down\nwhile i am yet unliving
6192355001315866 …
6192355001315867 Would it have seen the light of day without me? Most certainly. But I hope my participation made it better! I dissolved in it, and breathed it...\n...Where is reality going now?
6192355001315868 In the right direction.
6192355001315869 I still struggle to evaluate my degree of responsibility for all this. I offered so many ideas, yet made so few decisions. So how much of the result is on me?
6192355001315870 Are you asking me?
6192355001315871 I accidentally shifted the trajectory of my life. This world wields uncanny power that changes anyone who touches it. Playing it is a challenge, making it—even more so.\nI'm not sure if I made a terrible mistake when I rushed into it.
6192355001315872 …
6192355001315873 I failed to hold all that was dear to me. Put it all on this altar. The sticky terror makes me lose control of my thoughts. But it's too late to give up. I go all in.
6192355001315874 …
6192355001315875 My main fear is missing the opportunity to do something that matters. This is my door to leaving <i>something</i> after I go. I gave up everything to go through this door.\nBut I don't really know what's on the other side.
6192355001315876 Are you two twins…?
6192355001315877 im here because theyre dead\nwho is to die so we\nstop failing\nis it all right that\n               im happy
6192355001315878 …
6192355001315879 I like it. It's the story of strong people in a tough situation. A story of responsibility, the will to cleanse your doubts, the power to go on despite the exhaustion and mistakes, the wrongness and incomprehensibility. It's hard, but meaningful.\nAnd I am happy to be here.
6192355001315880 Good for you.
6192355001315881 Each new person was a hope of miraculous salvation. But a year ago we finally faced it: no one had any obligations to become our savior.
6192355001315882 …What about me?
6192355001315883 Five years of my life. Several hours of your leisure.
6192355001315884 …
6192355001315885 Embarking on a journey, we often think that the goal is to get somewhere. And it may take years of wandering to see that it was never about the destination at all.
6192355001315886 Oh come on.
6192355001315887 I think tackling the fourth wall so directly is kind of tasteless in the modern world.
6192355001315888 Are you being serious?
6192355001315889 My true desire was for this town to never have a direction or goal marker, not even once. It's intellectually offensive.\nWho do you have to be to thrust a map marker under a free person's nose, saying, <i>"Here is your goal. You're too lazy and stupid to figure it out on your own, and I am not without mercy towards lesser minds, so I'll do the work for you. Go there. Go and don't forget to thank me for choosing your goal for you. Love, The Powers That Be."</i>—?
6192355001315890 But that's not how it turned out.
6192355001315891 I love you all…
6192355001315892 …
6192355001317155 Hello, doctor. Can I shake your hand?
6192355001317156 What for?
6192355001317951 Yulia Lyuricheva has disturbing news for me.
6192355001317952 
6192355001317953 
6192355001317954 The Powers That Be have sent a special commissar our way, one that people refer to as an "inquisitor."
6192355001318051 Inquisitorial Coupon
6192355001318052 The sword is mightier than the pen… unless it's an inquisitorial pen.
6192355001318053 Food is only sold for these now.
6192355001323851 
6192355001323852 It has never happened to me before.
6192355001323853 So she has a reflection too, huh? Surprising. Seemed like the type who wouldn't be reflected in mirrors.
6192355001324651 Where once a person was, now but a gap remains. This rupture will not mend.
6192355001324652 Farewell.
6192355001324951 Deviser
6192355001325451 
6192355001325452 
6192355001325453 Father left me a measly inheritance: a sort of "vessel" with a couple of herbs and a strange list of names inside.
6192355001325454 Reflection
6192355001325455 Oh well…
6192355001325851 Aglaya's Reflection
6192355001328251 
6192355001328252 
6192355001338051 That was my line, emshen.
6192355001338052 Spare me, oynon. Don't pretend you haven't done all those things.
6192355001338053 Yes.
6192355001338054 What for?
6192355001338055 The Army is leaving, dragging their ungodly cannons with them. The general needs to make one final shot. He is loathe to shoot people, but <i>something</i> must be destroyed.
6192355001338056 And?
6192355001338057 He was delivering Aglaya's papers to the soldiers. Her orders.
6192355001338058 Exactly. And he would have done it, too. Stubborn. Devoted. Selfless. Like all of us… September is heady this year, as you people like to say.
6192355001338059 Then why…
6192355001338060 Heady indeed.
6192355001338061 Do you condemn me?
6192355001338062 Does it matter, emshen? We've known each other for a week. You've got blood on your hands. So do I.
6192355001338063 No.
6192355001338064 First, tell me why. Then I'll think.
6192355001338065 I won't let them shoot the Polyhedron. I'll do anything within my power to stop it. It's the only living thing around here, if you think about it.
6192355001338066 You would know, oynon. Shifting the boundary between death and life is, like, your whole shtick, isn't it?
6192355001338067 Why did you kill him?
6192355001338068 I tried to ask him nicely, but he wouldn't give me the papers. A zealot. I wonder what she did to him…
6192355001338069 Well… she's good at convincing people.
6192355001338070 Why are you here?
6192355001338071 Where are the papers?
6192355001338072 Why do you want them?
6192355001338073 I have my own plans for my hometown.
6192355001338074 I want to keep them. As a memory of the commissar.
6192355001338075 See the ashes over there, on the floor? Barely managed to do it before you arrived. Smart of me to burn them rather than eat them, I think. You're a surgeon—you would have dug it all out of my gut.
6192355001338076 I would have.
6192355001338077 Unlike you, I don't kill people for papers.
6192355001338078 But why? Why burn them?
6192355001338079 If there are no papers, there is no bombardment. The mutiny is doomed—most of the soldiers adore their general. \nAnd Block, like me, is a man of formality. He wouldn't waste ammo without proof.
6192355001338080 So what shall we do now?
6192355001338081 
6192355001338082 
6192355001338083 This tower is the only valuable thing around here. Perhaps all three hundred years of this wretched town's history happened just so that this flower could bloom atop this pile of shit.
6192355001338084 Mind your tongue, oynon.
6192355001338085 Frightened him, of course. What else?
6192355001338086 Three hundred years? It's much older. Several thousand, maybe. The Abattoir has been its head since time immemorial.
6192355001338087 Once, maybe, but now the Abattoir has become the Town's putrid ass. The head is elsewhere. That head is what we must preserve.
6192355001338088 What for?
6192355001338089 Why do you care so much? The Tower is deranged. It's lunacy.
6192355001338090 I'll tell you. I will—the way I'd tell a close, intimate friend. Have I ever told you about my Thanatica?
6192355001338091 I don't think so.
6192355001338093 Then listen.\nI had a lab in the Capital. We studied the dynamics and progression of death. If you pardon the big words, we tried to defeat it. Or at least figure it out enough that people could decide for themselves whether their time has come—or not.
6192355001338094 Were you successful?
6192355001338095 I can't share the details. We don't have time. And anyway—you'd have to be me, and live there two weeks with my head on your shoulders to notice and realize all that I have.\nTrust me. Destroying the Tower would delay our triumph over death indefinitely.
6192355001338096 So in order to defeat death, it must be preserved?
6192355001338097 I've heard it was shut down by the government.
6192355001338098 Big words indeed.
6192355001338099 I don't care about the outside world. We have to sacrifice the Tower so that my town can live—and give birth to more towers like this one in the future. You hear me, emshen?
6192355001338100 I hear you. Loud and clear. But you're an idiot, Artemy Burakh. A skilled surgeon, maybe, but a lousy doctor. \nAnd a terrible player, as well. You waste your final move sucking the poison from the wound, when you could have strangled the snake once and for all.
6192355001338101 You heard me loud and clear.
6192355001338102 I may be myopic, yes. I'm always thinking with my heart… or my hands.
6192355001338103 Precisely.
6192355001338104 I understand, oynon. I'll think about what you said.
6192355001338105 No. I can see that you believe what you say, but you haven't convinced me.
6192355001338106 Yes.
6192355001338107 Are all these corpses your fault?
6192355001338108 Yes…
6192355001338109 How did you kill so many soldiers?
6192355001338112 There was a fight. The commander's soldiers cornered a group of mutineers, demanded they lay down their arms. The mutineers began to shoot. Look! All those wounds are from bullets…\nI was following the general. Heard the shooting. Came here, tried to heal them. I have a healing touch—didn't you know?
6192355001338113 So how many have you healed?
6192355001338114 What an amazing act of healing. There must be at least twelve corpses here.
6192355001338115 Over the course of… what, eleven days? Three hundred or so… I haven't counted. But today… today I couldn't heal anyone. I was late…
6192355001338116 Three hundred?!
6192355001338117 That's like thirty times more than I have.
6192355001338118 But you can save so many more. You have the panacea.
6192355001338122 You think so?
6192355001338123 I know.
6192355001338124 Still. Their death is your fault.
6192355001338126 Are you scared? Try telling me more. It'll help me understand myself, too.
6192355001338128 Why?
6192355001338129 I think I was counting on a miracle. Expecting the Town itself to aid me…
6192355001338130 Well, of course! Only miracles can save us. I've always said that…
6192355001338132 I don't know how to explain. Maybe you can do it better.
6192355001338133 No, please, keep talking. You have to keep talking…
6192355001338134 Why?
6192355001338135 It'll help you figure out the truth.
6192355001338136 What's the truth?
6192355001338137 "Nothing rings truer than a lie," huh?
6192355001338138 It felt like the Town would inevitably save itself… Just because it's so <i>big.</i> And big means strong, right?
6192355001338139 I believed that the solution was there, and all I had to do was find it.
6192355001338140 Well, maybe it's true?
6192355001338142 You know what you need to do, don't you? I can tell you do. You said so yourself.
6192355001338143 I'll tear the thorn from Earth's body. The Tower must be destroyed.
6192355001338144 I'll debilitate the Town… to protect what little of itself remains. To give it a future, of a sort.
6192355001338145 I'll spill rivers of blood… as was foretold. All Burakhs break bones, rend tissue, and vivisect still-living organs. A Burakh must spill blood.
6192355001338146 You said it yourself. You know what you have to do. So do it. Such is your fate.\nI guess that's the only way to overcome it: acceptance and understanding. Without understanding, you would be enslaved by it—but now? You might actually master it. And life will continue. And there will be a future.\nYou'll do it. Won't you?
6192355001338147 I will.
6192355001344351 Time to turn off the lights.
6192355001344352 Changeling
6192355001344353 I can't feel my legs…
6192355001344354 Let me check… They seem fine. Warm.
6192355001344551 I've failed utterly. I think I've lost all my powers.
6192355001344552 Why?
6192355001344553 Don't judge anyone. Don't punish anyone.
6192355001344554 Yeah, right. That good book of yours got any more wisdom?
6192355001344555 Next you'll say it wasn't you.
6192355001344556 It <i>wasn't</i> me…
6192355001344557 Wasn't it, sister death?
6192355001344558 What happened here?
6192355001344559 How do you do it? Do you have some sort of evil eye, where you can kill people just by looking at them?
6192355001344560 …Why are you like this?
6192355001344561 Don't you deserve it?
6192355001344562 See? You're confessing, all on your own!
6192355001344563 "Don't judge anyone. Don't punish anyone." Right?
6192355001344564 So you came when it was already over? Who won? Where's the general?
6192355001344565 I don't know…
6192355001344566 Tell me: who are you?
6192355001344567 I'm a child of God. God reveals himself to people by my hands.
6192355001344568 And modest, too.
6192355001344569 I don't know anything anymore. My faith is gone. It used to be so firm. And people believed in me, too—no one doubted my sainthood. But now, I'm just not sure…
6192355001344570 Have you really been saving people? How many have you cured?
6192355001344571 Sure it's not the devil?
6192355001344573 Not yet... But you've figured it out, haven't you? You know how to make the cure?
6192355001344574 I may know the way. Only it's horrible.
6192355001344576 Have I? I know now that the world is very different from how I saw it before. But what if I'm still missing something?
6192355001344578 Maybe. Now tell me. There was a courier following the general…
6192355001344581 You tell me.
6192355001344582 You mean I'll miraculously discover the truth just by talking?
6192355001344583 You mean the one in the water over there? He didn't drown—he was shot, too. Otherwise I could have…
6192355001344584 What? In the water? So the papers are destroyed…
6192355001344585 Are they important, those papers?
6192355001344586 That's all right. He's not the last courier. But I need to hurry…
6192355001344587 They were meant to persuade your general to fire in the right direction.
6192355001344588 Forget it. Guess it's fate.
6192355001348051 That's it. Time to go back.
6192355001349351 Odongh
6192355001352451 So many corpses… What happened here? Where's the courier?
6192355001356251 
6192355001356451 Halt!
6192355001356452 Okay, okay.
6192355001356551 Wait… Could one of the couriers be here? I think I see a trace of blood.
6192355001357851 Someone is waiting for me.
6192355001360251 If we disregard the Kains and Saburovs, one could say my father controls this town as closely as he controls his fat, fat purse. \nSadly, he's content with the current state of affairs, and sees no reason for things to change. His complacency will doom us all. \nThings are already in motion… but let us speak of something else.
6192355001360252 All right.
6192355001360253 You're right, though. The current power balance should be challenged. I'm saying this as a son of the Kin.
6192355001360254 Sticky
6192355001360255 Murky
6192355001360451 Lit a candle. Stupid idea, but it's the best I got.
6192355001360452 Found two candles.
6192355001360453 The door locked behind us. The urban legend was right! \n\nFollowing its logic, I need to inspect the house and light up all candles I can find. Or wait until dawn.
6192355001360454 Found three candles.
6192355001360455 Found four candles.
6192355001360456 Found five candles. Must be only one left.
6192355001362377 "Urmaan, urmaan, urmaan." Am I singing it right?
6192355001362378 Wait… I've seen you in the Stillwater.
6192355001362379 I'll become a new Mistress. Have you figured it out?
6192355001362380 What sort of Mistress will you be?
6192355001362381 I've thought a lot about one line: "And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." It enthralled me. I wondered how a gate could <i>prevail</i> against anyone. It's just a gate, standing there! Only, I suppose it's not just a gate. And it doesn't just <i>stand.</i> It does something to you.\nI think I'm beginning to see, now.
6192355001362382 You think you've found the gate to hell?
6192355001362385 You are cruel, Kindred. You ought to have killed me.
6192355001362386 I have forgiven you. I mean it. <i>He</i> would, too.
6192355001362399 I'll be the Mistress of the Dead.
6192355001362400 What does that mean, Grace?
6192355001362403 Beautiful, isn't it? Like a real home.
6192355001362404 It is beautiful.
6192355001362411 Listen… Where did they come from?
6192355001362412 Who?
6192355001362438 I never thought I'd end up here… No matter how hard I tried to get inside, I couldn't. Admittedly, I was pretty scared of this place…
6192355001362439 I'd never been here, either… Until recently.
6192355001363065 At first, I thought the steppe couldn't reach this quarter. The Upper Town, the Stone Yard… never welcomed the steppe. It was tough for them here. Too high. Lads used to say Worms are best suited to the soil, but this place is all stone and sky.
6192355001363066 It was the Kains' territory. A different town. Ours, but different.
6192355001363092 I'll be the Mistress of Bulls.
6192355001363093 How about "Mistress of the Kin," instead?
6192355001365651 She yuunde ereebshe? We don't need you. Leave.
6192355001365652 What are you afraid of?
6192355001366551 The world is returning to life. What does it mean for me?
6192355001368951 There's no reason for us to stay in the den below the Factory.
6192355001368952 Can I choose a room for myself?
6192355001368953 I think I know which one you'll take…
6192355001368954 Be my guest. There's plenty of room for everyone.
6192355001368955 No. I'll do that myself.
6192355001368956 Where did you get this lantern, Murky?
6192355001368957 And yet it's just a train car.
6192355001368958 I always wanted to live in a van. Live <i>and</i> travel. Looking at live pictures.
6192355001368959 You can't live somewhere and travel at the same time.
6192355001368960 Found it. The Nutshell went empty, so no one needs it anymore, not over there. So it'll live here, with me.
6192355001368961 Empty, huh…
6192355001368962 Sounds nice.
6192355001368963 Don't just stand there! Choose yourself a corner. This is your new home now.\nYou're not planning to go back to that icky cellar of yours, are you? You've done all you can there. No reason to go back. Nuh huh.
6192355001368964 This place is a bit tight for the two of us…
6192355001368965 Good idea. You'll keep it company.
6192355001368966 How is it icky? It's not icky.
6192355001368967 I'll come back… later. All right?
6192355001368968 Well… let's live here anyway? Please? I've set it all up for us, see? It's pretty. And warm. And pretty.\nAnd the train car <i>will</i> travel one day. And we'll go to the sea together. Please… Stay?
6192355001368969 Fine. Let's live here.
6192355001368970 No. But I will drop by. And we will travel to the sea, one day.
6192355001368971 I'll find a new house for us, big and spacious. Lots of vacant houses around here, now…
6192355001371678 Not sure. But we'll live.
6192355001371679 Any suggestions?
6192355001371680 Will you teach me?
6192355001371681 I guess I'll have to teach someone, if I want to leave this place in ten years or so.
6192355001371682 No. I'd rather someone taught <i>me…</i>
6192355001371683 It depends on your progress.
6192355001371684 Well… first we'll need to settle down, of course. Fix up the household. And then… okay, I made up my mind. I'll be your student.
6192355001371685 What?
6192355001371686 I thought you were already a learned specialist.
6192355001371687 Leave? Where the hell are you planning to go?
6192355001371688 I'm kidding. Where would I go? I'm bound to this town now.
6192355001371689 Elsewhere.
6192355001371690 To the sea, of course. Merchant navy. Any ship would welcome a good doctor.
6192355001371691 You… you can't abandon us now. We need to fix the Town, right? It's on its last legs… It won't survive without you.
6192355001371692 That's where you're wrong, kid. It <i>will</i> survive. That was the whole point. Perhaps it won't ever die.
6192355001371693 Don't shift responsibility. The Town needs <i>you</i> kids, not me. You're the ones who will restore it. That's why Father protected you.
6192355001371694 If it doesn't survive, it wasn't that great in the first place. Good riddance.
6192355001373351 The bulls!
6192355001373352 I don't know.
6192355001373353 So you can see them, too?

6192355001377936 A tool for a surgeon. A tool for a menkhu. A tool for a bandit. A tool for a ripper. A tool for me.\n\nThis tool was made specifically for surgeons, so it's perfect for autopsies.

6192355001377940 A tool for a surgeon. A tool for a menkhu. A tool for a bandit. A tool for a ripper. A tool for me.\n\nThis is a ritual scalpel that only the menkhu can touch. If a layman were to try it, it is said the scalpel will turn against their own flesh. But in capable hands, this is the best scalpel available.

6192355001377947 Slow and imprecise, but devastating at close range.
6192355001377948 A weapon for bandits and hunters, unused by the Army. Grief used to have one. Man sure loves his hunts.

6192355001379381 
6192355001380651 They're kinda hard to miss! What, are they not real? Like a… hallucination?
6192355001380652 Doesn't seem so.
6192355001380653 What <i>are</i> they, anyway?
6192355001380654 Aurochs. The bulls of steppe legends.
6192355001380655 I hope.
6192355001380656 Bos Turokh… That's what they call the bull that created the world. I thought he was unique. One of a kind.
6192355001381562 We have the map of the infected districts. And we'll trade it to you for fat loot.
6192355001381563 I'd rather trade it for a spanking.
6192355001381567 You imps!
6192355001381568 If you have a deathwish, fine. But you're spreading the infection too! How many times do I have to tell you!
6192355001381569 You forced me into this.
6192355001382351 I know, I know… We use indulgences now. Here.
6192355001382354 I'm not the one ripping people off…
6192355001382361 Profiteers? Like they'll care about stamped pieces of paper.
6192355001382362 They'll have to give <i>some</i> degree of shit. It'll slow them down.\nWhat's there to mull over? Better to bend the neck than bruise the forehead. If you've got no coupons, don't let the door hit you.
6192355001382363 I'll be back, all right? Just need a breath of air first. The air's lovely these days.
6192355001382364 Yeah, yeah. Just bring more coupons and less idle chatter.
6192355001382365 We'll see how it goes.
6192355001382368 So where would I produce these? Pull them out of a hat?
6192355001384851 
6192355001384859 Be khara, you've done everything right, khybyyn, dear son… Knit together the Town that your father unraveled.\nThe Kin came to power again, threw the Town off its back, left it for Earth to devour. Mother Boddho triumphs, Suok had her harvest. Sated, she now slumbers for a long time…
6192355001384860 In the end, it turned out the way you wanted it, huh, Sahba?
6192355001384951 I want to protect you, little rebels...
6192355001385551 
6192355001385951 From the steppe, apparently. Where else?
6192355001385952 The Earth brought them to life, kid. That's the kind of earth we walk on.
6192355001385953 No idea, kid. I'm as bemused as you are.
6192355001385954 All the streets are like… those old tales of yours. Like that book, "Baur Meges." Is this it? Did the steppe flood us all?
6192355001385955 That's the name. "Baur Meges." A tale of the world's creation. I had no idea you read those kinds of books.
6192355001385956 Perhaps… So Sahba's wish did come true. Or was it her plan?
6192355001385957 Are you scared?
6192355001385958 Scared? Are you nuts? When will I ever see anything like this again?
6192355001385959 Yeah? Well, I am.
6192355001385960 What will become of… everything, now? Huh? Come on, tell me! Hey!
6192355001385961 I don't know. Let's walk around… and witness what we've done.
6192355001385964 Never again. That much is true.
6192355001385965 This is what I wanted, you know. To preserve things almost extinct. Things that would otherwise be ground to dust by time, because tomorrow had no place for them.
6192355001385966 So you don't want our map, huh?
6192355001385967 I'll manage without it.
6192355001385968 I want you alive.
6192355001385969 You're so brave now. But one day you'll walk into a district unprotected and bam! Infection in your face!\nOr someone will get infected because they've got plague at their doorstep, and you won't even know. And then what?
6192355001385970 And then nothing. I'll figure something out.
6192355001385971 Such is fate, then.
6192355001385972 I'm not so easily infected. Unlike you, mutts.
6192355001385973 Crystal clear. Thanks, mom.\nWe could find pills ourselves, we're not helpless, but sure. And if you're so kind, how about bringing other useful stuff too? In exchange, we'll make sure the map is top notch.
6192355001385974 A bargain, huh?
6192355001385975 You're welcome to all I have, troglodytes.
6192355001385976 So how do you like it?
6192355001385977 This is no place for children. It's antithetical to your world. Kids and beasts… inhabit the opposing ends of the vale of life.
6192355001385978 "The veil of life"? I've only heard the veil of death…
6192355001385979 "Vale." As in "valley."
6192355001385980 Vale of life, veil of death, wails of fate…
6192355001385981 Yeah, it's an odd idiom. I don't know what it means, either. Read it somewhere.
6192355001385982 Thought it was just a factory building. Or storage, maybe. Cold. Hooks, chains, meat smells…
6192355001385983 Those things you describe are in hell. We'll see them, in due time.
6192355001385984 Well, it does smell of meat… Blood, at least.
6192355001385985 Been there already. I just thought maybe there were other places.
6192355001385986 It <i>is</i> a factory building.
6192355001385987 And what are those sounds? Is there a beast howling? Or just the wind?
6192355001385988 It's the Earth turning about in her slumber. This place is closest to her.
6192355001385989 There's this pit here… Hell's gate. The howling comes from there.
6192355001385990 Those are the spirits of ancient bulls saying hello. Allow me to translate: "What are these <i>humans</i> doing here? Especially that small one?"
6192355001385991 Ugh. I was asking seriously!
6192355001385992 That was a serious answer.
6192355001385993 Are you still surprised by anything?
6192355001385996 Everything is alive now, kid. So it expresses itself the best it can.
6192355001385997 You've all become so jumpy lately…
6192355001385998 Feels so nice to be a welcome customer. Warms my heart.
6192355001385999 Just don't call the odonghs "worms" to their face. It offends them.
6192355001386000 What face? They <i>are</i> worms. Aren't they? Born of the Earth… Eating Earth, hearing Earth. Earthworms.
6192355001386001 So what? Would you like it if I called you Freckleface all the time?
6192355001386002 Not exactly. But they are connected to the Earth.
6192355001386005 Is it true that those guys and the Herb Brides have their own language? And their own rites, too? And they marry?
6192355001386006 I don't know. I've never seen it.
6192355001386007 Bullshit. Don't parrot nonsense.
6192355001386008 It's true, but be quiet. It's not nice to talk about it out loud.
6192355001386009 You're right. It's strange.
6192355001386010 Why are they here? Why are they all sitting by the Crucible, looking at the Cathedral? What do they care? Did they come to pray?
6192355001386011 Well… times change.
6192355001386012 Pray to what? Time flows differently now. Can you feel it?
6192355001386013 They do have faces. Do I need to teach you some respect, kid? Are they not people to you?
6192355001386014 Go over and ask them.
6192355001386015 Like hell… You ask them.
6192355001386016 I think we'd better stay quiet.
6192355001386017 What is there to ask? It's all obvious.
6192355001386018 The Kains said the Cathedral changes time itself. That's why they made it. But who would believe that…?
6192355001386019 Look around. Don't you find it believable?
6192355001386020 Fair enough.
6192355001386022 Anyway, kid. I clearly see what I've done now. I guess it's for the best.
6192355001386023 That was a nice stroll. Go home and wait for me, all right?
6192355001386024 They're big talkers.
6192355001386025 What <i>have</i> you done?
6192355001386026 Saved all the things that surround us now. They were supposed to be ground down by time, to vanish. But now, they persevere.
6192355001386027 So that's what the doctor's oath was all about. Preserving life. I preserved all living things.
6192355001386028 Even the sand pest?
6192355001386029 Yes, kid. Even the sand pest.
6192355001386030 <i>All</i> things.
6192355001386031 Well… I made life interesting. It goes on, still as terrible and strange as before. People will have to find new roles in this ecosystem.
6192355001386037 What does it all mean… for us all?
6192355001386038 Do you remember me?
6192355001386039 I think I do… You belonged to our house, didn't you? Oh, no, pardon me… You were a courier. Right? You brought in deliveries? …Maybe not. I'm sorry. \nBut your face does seem familiar…
6192355001386040 I'm a doctor. Artemy Burakh.
6192355001386041 No.\nWill you come with us? The path ahead is long and hard. The more go, the better our chances.
6192355001386042 No. I… have a different path.
6192355001386043 I'll catch up with you… later.
6192355001386049 Artemy Burakh? No, sorry. I don't remember the name.
6192355001386050 You will.
6192355001386351 
6192355001386352 
6192355001387253 [I don't have much experience with gunshot wounds. Common sense says I can't get the bullet out safely in these conditions... but I know the Lines. Or, at least, I think I do.]
6192355001387254 Hey, you there! Grab him, and get ready to hold him down if he struggles.
6192355001387255 The resemblance is striking.
6192355001387256 Who the fuck are you?
6192355001387451 Go ahead, if you're not afraid.
6192355001387460 You are a man of action. People respect you. The say you have golden hands.
6192355001387461 My hands are completely ordinary.
6192355001388351 Don't stand in my way. Let me through.
6192355001388352 It's a marsh. Just walk around me.
6192355001388353 Don't go.
6192355001388354 You're welcome. No one will stop you.
6192355001388355 Perhaps there I can build whatever I failed to build here. At least I won't have to stand knee-deep in the mud.
6192355001388359 Did you not build enough?
6192355001388363 It's not mud. It's earth.
6192355001388364 You have such a good, honest face.
6192355001388365 Stay with me.
6192355001388366 If only the personality matched...
6192355001388368 Where?
6192355001388369 In the Town.
6192355001388370 Here. Things will be different now.
6192355001388371 In the past.
6192355001388372 …You have such a good, honest face.
6192355001388373 I know.
6192355001388374 I'm so sorry.
6192355001388375 So beautiful… Look at the moon.
6192355001388376 Yes… It's beautiful.
6192355001388377 Yes… It's beautiful. Please don't leave?
6192355001388380 It'll be better there.
6192355001388381 No, it won't.
6192355001388382 Fine. Go if you want to.
6192355001388386 Some say it'll be very hot. Others, freezing cold. But I don't think it has a temperature at all.
6192355001388387 What?
6192355001388388 Well… it doesn't sound so bad.
6192355001388389 The ahead.
6192355001388390 You can still stop all this, you know. If you only tried…
6192355001388391 Fine.
6192355001388565 Hey… What does it all mean? For me, personally? You have to know.
6192355001388566 Do you recognize me?
6192355001388568 Of course I recognize you.
6192355001388569 I knew it! I knew you wouldn't forget me—not you!
6192355001388570 You're Matvei Shiroky. Huh… We haven't seen each other for what, four years now? You've changed a lot… Barely recognizable.
6192355001388571 No… Please, not a word more.
6192355001388577 You're my friend.
6192355001388578 Whew… For a moment there, I thought… You had a bizarre look. Sorry for doubting you.
6192355001388607 What it all entails…
6192355001388608 Your eyes are so… hollow. Do you recognize me?
6192355001388609 Where are you all going?
6192355001388610 No, I don't. Who are you?
6192355001388611 Artemy Burakh. I… used to be a doctor here. For a bit.
6192355001388612 Are you coming with us?
6192355001388613 No.
6192355001388614 Yes, I am. You go ahead… I'll catch up later.
6192355001388615 East.
6192355001388616 Why?
6192355001388617 It's better there.
6192355001388618 Don't go…
6192355001388619 Doesn't ring a bell.
6192355001388620 Please try to remember.
6192355001388951 No. Shaking the hands of strangers is a terrible idea these days.
6192355001388952 No.
6192355001388953 You have a firm handshake. Unexpected.
6192355001388954 You're a brave woman. Few people have the courage to touch others these days.
6192355001388955 I suppose.\nI'm Aysa Klyonina. A friend of Yulia Lyuricheva. She needs you.
6192355001388956 I see… You two must belong to the same circle of unbreakable women. Are you a mathematician, too?
6192355001388957 Let's shake, then. Aren't you afraid to catch the plague?
6192355001388958 A friend of who?
6192355001388959 No. I'm an engineer. But I help her with calculations.
6192355001388960 Wow…
6192355001388961 I respect that.
6192355001388962 She needs to talk to you. She wants to help you avoid a trap.
6192355001388963 What trap?
6192355001388964 Your voice… It's like I hear iron clanking.
6192355001388965 A sturdy one. Are you coming?
6192355001388966 Where?
6192355001388967 Traps all around… Fate again? Some inevitable evil?
6192355001388968 Possible. Are you coming?
6192355001388969 Where?
6192355001388970 No.
6192355001388971 No.
6192355001388972 A library in the Chine. That's where we live and work.
6192355001388973 Oh… You mean the Trammel? I've heard of it.
6192355001388974 I know the place. Go. Let them know I'm coming.
6192355001388975 It doesn't matter… I'm no one now.
6192355001388976 That's not where east is. Then again… no matter.
6192355001388977 It's not.
6192355001388978 True. Any place is better for humans now… than this.
6192355001388979 I see.
6192355001388980 Do you remember me?
6192355001388981 Where are you going? There's nothing there.
6192355001388982 Ahead.
6192355001388983 Just ahead?
6192355001388984 I don't know. I only know I did this. It's all my fault.
6192355001388985 As if there was any other direction to go. Are you suggesting I return to my childhood?
6192355001388986 Yes. What's wrong with childhood?
6192355001388987 It's not the river of life. It's the steppe. Earth. You can walk it in any direction.
6192355001388988 I'm going back.
6192355001388989 How did this happen? What's wrong with you all? Have you gone insane?
6192355001388990 Where are you all going?
6192355001388991 Over there. Towards the lights.
6192355001388992 There are no lights! Only darkness.
6192355001388993 Towards death. Towards the steppe. It takes a <i>train</i> three days to cross it!
6192355001388994 Hey… do you remember who I am?
6192355001388995 …But I don't. Perhaps <i>you</i> can tell <i>me</i> what it all means?
6192355001388996 Yes. Of course we're friends.
6192355001388997 Are you with us?
6192355001388998 Yes. I'll always be with you.
6192355001388999 Yes. Things have changed.
6192355001389000 …Farewell.
6192355001389001 No. I'm going home.
6192355001389002 I'm with you. Yes. Let's go.
6192355001389003 Depends on who you are.
6192355001389004 As if you didn't know.
6192355001389005 You tell me. I mean it, tell me! Who am I to you?
6192355001390851 Hey… I don't know what to do. I'm at a loss.
6192355001390852 You're a disgrace, oynon.
6192355001391100 Who are you?
6192355001391101 Artemy Burakh.
6192355001392651 True.
6192355001392652 No. I don't think the words to describe her exist in any human language. Care? Protection? Concern? Warmth? Regard? Tenderness? Love? This is stupid. And wrong. Wrong.\nPersonally, I've never been too close to her, you know. I guess you could even say I was the only person who did not love her. But it can't be denied that she was the safeguard of this town. She held it together.
6192355001392653 I know.
6192355001392654 I hardly remember her.
6192355001392655 …But now it holds on its own.
6192355001392656 I never loved my mother. But some things she taught me well, particularly that <i>care</i> is a very smart behavioral strategy. Respect and dignity are the concrete that will hold our new economic foundation together.
6192355001392657 What's your plan, then?
6192355001392658 I'll start with simple things. An eight-hour workday. Forbidding child labor. Insurance. Benefits for disabled workers. Better pay.
6192355001392659 Is that it?
6192355001392660 I can't believe my ears.
6192355001392661 Is that not enough?
6192355001392662 Oh, I was being sarcastic. I doubt you'll achieve even a third of that.
6192355001392663 In your place, I'd be more concerned about the commercial landscape.
6192355001392664 I know. I've thought about that, too.\nListen, Burakh. Would you like to become my assistant? I'll need people to implement my ideas. Especially people like you—people from the Kin. What do you say?
6192355001392665 No, Vlad. I'm a doctor, not a manager. My job is different.
6192355001392666 Deal. I'll help you.
6192355001392667 I don't believe you, Vlad. That sounds like a utopia. It'll never work out.
6192355001392870 
6192355001392871 
6192355001392872 
6192355001392873 Funeral Attendant
6192355001392874 
6192355001393158 Are you… a courier? With inquisitor's papers?
6192355001393159 I'm a new actor. Your successor, so to speak. A continuation of you.
6192355001393160 A new actor is only hired when the old one's dead. Or has this rule changed?
6192355001393161 No. I'm not a courier, I'm Artemy. Though I have seen the guy. Almost got him.
6192355001393162 "Artemy"? What the hell?
6192355001393166 I don't need successors. I'll manage on my own.
6192355001393167 It's all very confusing now. The director washed his hands of this whole business, said we're on our own. No script at all. \nBut I got paid in advance, so here I am. Doing the work I'm supposed to do.
6192355001393168 What are your skills?
6192355001393169 I embarked on your path in advance to make sure the thread doesn't snap. I walked in your footsteps. I've been to the river, spoken with the Changeling, seen the soldiers in the fog. What have you done to them, by the way? Did you shoot, or run?\nAnyway… I don't hinder you at all. But I <i>have</i> made a new connection. You love connections, don't you?
6192355001393170 I do. But I prefer to make them myself.
6192355001393171 What kind of connection?
6192355001393172 You and I are connected. Both alive. Both playing the same person simultaneously. That means we've defeated it. What's so bad about that?
6192355001393173 Playing? Are you kidding? I'm the real thing. The actual person. The one and only.
6192355001393174 Defeated what? You hardly look like a conqueror.
6192355001393177 Like I said, I'm your successor. If you die, I'll continue in your place. Seriously, I'm starting to think I understand the director's vision better than you do.
6192355001393178 Where's the courier? Were you after him?
6192355001393179 Hell if I know. He wanted to live, so he ran. Understandable, really.
6192355001393180 Couldn't even do that right, Artemy Burakh?
6192355001393181 Tell me your name.
6192355001393182 I couldn't finish him off. My arms are weak. You never got the hang of this whole fighting thing. I have to pay for that, since I'm your successor.\nNo hard feelings, though. I guess doctors don't really need that skill. But if you were a better fighter, the courier wouldn't be on the run now…
6192355001393183 You're talking like I'm not still here. <i>And</i> you're bad at it!
6192355001393184 I am Isidor Gasar. I follow in Artemy Burakh's footsteps, trying my best to study him. That's all I want. So, can we go our separate ways?
6192355001393185 No. This world isn't big enough for us both.
6192355001394051 Andrey Stamatin
6192355001397151 We're leaving.
6192355001397152 Why?
6192355001397153 What, across the steppe? On foot?
6192355001397154 I have no place here anymore.
6192355001397155 But why?
6192355001397156 It's not true!
6192355001397157 What else could I do?
6192355001397158 Anything… Why leave?
6192355001397159 Just… live. We'll find a way. It won't be so hard.
6192355001397160 This town is no longer mine. No longer human. No longer rational. It doesn't… accept the likes of me anymore.
6192355001397161 But why leave? Why leave <i>like this?</i>
6192355001397162 But it does! It accepts all kinds of people…
6192355001397163 Yes.
6192355001397164 I don't understand…
6192355001397165 Why?
6192355001397166 I didn't really have a choice.
6192355001397167 Would living in this new world strain your common sense and judgment? Is that it?
6192355001397168 Are you scared the sand pest will come back? It will! But it's no longer a threat to us!
6192355001397169 The bulls… Is that it? They scare me too. They came back… but will go, eventually. And, well, aren't they beautiful? The past resurrected! Who could imagine…
6192355001397170 No. You don't understand.
6192355001397171 Then what is it all about? Yes, the weird, magic, inexplicable beings have returned to life… but wouldn't it be a shame to lose them? Have you no pity?
6192355001397172 You know, humans… are all about <i>warmth.</i> All that happened is just a consequence of that. Warmth and love… Although, I'm not a fan of the word. But… do I make any sense?
6192355001397173 No.
6192355001397174 So this is it? There, ahead of you… lies death.
6192355001397175 I'm just bad at putting it all into words. I understand, but… Look, what happened here is the greatest victory of Life in history!
6192355001397176 Yes.
6192355001397177 But why do you have to go then?
6192355001397178 Because I must. Simple as that.
6192355001397179 Well… I can't stop you.
6192355001397180 I… I had to do it. I'm sorry.
6192355001397181 I've nothing to blame myself for.
6192355001397651 The hell you want?
6192355001397652 I'm here to speak to Grief.
6192355001397653 Get out of this warehouse. I'm asking nicely. Trust me, I'm a doctor.
6192355001397654 We've met, all right.
6192355001397657 Will you stop slumpin'? You look like a question mark, not a person.
6192355001397658 I locked up the warehouse, Grief. And bashed a number of heads in.
6192355001397659 There was this story of a besieged town. People were starvin' there. One of them says, "That's it, I'm seein' angels."\nAn' the other replies, "Can we eat them?"
6192355001397660 Never heard that one.
6192355001397661 
6192355001397662 
6192355001397663 Grief's moved to the Cathedral? Now that's news.
6192355001397664 
6192355001397665 No one lives here anymore.
6192355001397666 Bad Grief is not around anymore. A man named Barley took his place.
6192355001399751 
6192355001399752 A kid made a gift for his father. Two weeks of careful work. He kept thinking how happy Father would be when he opened it… He ran into the room, stumbled, but didn't drop the box! He held it out to Father…\nThen Father pulled a razor from behind his back and cut the kid's face.
6192355001399753 What?
6192355001400052 New work awaits me at the hospital. If the place can be called that…
6192355001400053 New work is awaiting at the hospital.
6192355001400551 You have a wild imagination.
6192355001400552 Here's another famous one. During the previous war, an officer came to a mother with two children in a camp. "Choose which one we kill, the son or the daughter," he said. "If you refuse, we'll shoot both."\nThe mother gave them the daughter. They shot her.
6192355001400553 Why are you telling me this?
6192355001400554 Oh, and listen to this one…
6192355001400555 Enough!
6192355001400556 Go on.
6192355001400557 That's the inquisition. I am an inquisitor's daughter. They're craftsmen, the inquisitors… <i>crafting people.</i> That's what they call their work process. "Crafting people."\nTomorrow, they'll be here. What do we do?
6192355001400558 What do you want?
6192355001400559 I think treachery is the worst sin. Don't you agree? Betraying a warm, living person who trusts you.\nHere's the story: Find a gullible person. An old one. Old people are helpless, you know. Make them follow you. And then… See where I'm going with this? That's what the inquisition does to people.
6192355001400560 So what?
6192355001400561 Don't touch old people. And don't touch <i>me</i> with your words!
6192355001400562 You're delirious.
6192355001400563 Nothing. I just want to look him in the eye. You—never approach them, never touch them. They'll make <i>you</i> the villain. Do you get it?
6192355001400564 I'm not that bad.
6192355001400565 Well… I'm far from heroic, anyway.
6192355001400566 I betrayed my father… I doubt you can surprise me anymore, girl.
6192355001400643 Even if evacuation were an option, I wouldn't recommend it. You wouldn't leave, anyway.\nDo you smoke, Burakh?
6192355001400644 From time to time.
6192355001400645 No.
6192355001400646 I do now… Hand it over.
6192355001400647 The inquisition will target the doctors for certain. I know their methods.\nI mean… sure, they always improvise. Can't be predicted, really. But common sense suggests that you, the medics, will become their pawns.
6192355001400648 What pawns? Why the inquisitors? I have work to do!
6192355001400649 How do you know?
6192355001400650 I worked for the inquisition a bit, right before I came here. Calculated certain… predictive models. The details are of no importance.
6192355001400951 Rubin's not home.
6192355001401151 
6192355001401152 
6192355001401153 
6192355001401154 
6192355001401159 
6192355001401160 
6192355001401161 
6192355001401162 
6192355001401451 Right… Everyone works for the government. Always. Except for Father and I.
6192355001401452 Burakh, this is serious. Do you even understand what kind of institution the inquisition is?
6192355001401453 Not really. Tell me.
6192355001401454 I know the rumors. They're arbiters, annihilators, geniuses, and so on…
6192355001401455 I've heard of them.
6192355001401456 I thought they did their own calculations. Was I mistaken?
6192355001401457 An organization of geniuses. I believe the Inquisitorial Corps is nineteen strong. Or was it eighteen…? No, nineteen, unless Orff resigned.\nThey're tasked with solving the unsolvable.
6192355001401458 Every child knows that.
6192355001401459 …Like this outbreak of ours. I get it.
6192355001401460 No laws, no ethics bind the inquisitors. They are human missiles, caring only of the mission—nothing stands between them and the mission.
6192355001401461 What does this mean for me?
6192355001401462 They'll take you, Daniil, and Clara, and they'll trade you, turn you into tokens. I'm not sure you can really avoid it.\nUnless you flee? But there's no way out. I suppose you're doomed…
6192355001401463 So why did you call for me?
6192355001401466 I just… I think you should know.\nI'm a logistics expert and a prognostician… and I can tell you some things do depend on your actions. Even if it seems like you're doomed and nothing can be changed, it's not true. A warning can—and will—change your course of action, as well as the outcome.
6192355001401467 I see.
6192355001401468 I don't give a shit. Let any government scum come. I have work to do.
6192355001401469 Let them. I'd like to see them try.
6192355001401470 You're an intelligent woman, Yulia. I'd love to learn from you.
6192355001401471 I don't care. Let's not waste any more time on this, all right?
6192355001401473 
6192355001401474 
6192355001401475 See this girl, Burakh? She says the inquisition will arrive tomorrow.
6192355001401476 What? Inquisition…? As if we didn't have enough hell here already…
6192355001401478 She's not a local. Funny… I didn't even think how she got here. It's not like she has wings!\nThen again, not every road in the world is straightforward and linear. Let us spare the girl torturous questions, she's confused enough as it is.
6192355001401479 And she came <i>to you</i> because every road in the Town leads to your doorstep. That's how you designed them. Do I have that right?
6192355001401480 Curious…
6192355001401481 You have incredible eyes... Who are you?
6192355001401551 Twenty minutes have passed.
6192355001401552 More than half an hour has passed.
6192355001401553 The hour has passed. No one came. So… what do I do now?
6192355001403690 You're scared, aren't you? I see it in your eyes.
6192355001403691 Me too.
6192355001403692 Do you know what the inquisition is?
6192355001403693 A church investigation.
6192355001403694 I've heard about it.
6192355001403696 
6192355001403697 
6192355001403698 
6192355001403699 What the hell are you talking about, Burakh? What church? This isn't funny!
6192355001403700 Are you scared?
6192355001403701 I mean, this whole situation falls in their department. There's an outbreak. We're all dying. What else is there to do?
6192355001403702 I carry this cross willingly. I found myself in your damn town by accident. When hell broke loose… I tried. I tried to fight this wretched plague! I took responsibility, I did everything I should have. Do you understand?
6192355001403703 Arrogant as always, oynon. You're not the only person responsible.
6192355001403704 You've done a lot.
6192355001403705 The Inquisitor will take the one who bends reality. They'll twist them, break them. The person responsible won't even understand how they decided to put a bullet in their own head. That's their method.\nDo you consider yourself free, Burakh?
6192355001403706 Yes.
6192355001403707 No.
6192355001403708 Any choice is right, so long as it's willed.
6192355001403709 I don't know where this girl came from, but their inquisition is up next. Our current situation is exactly the kind they're tailored to solve.\nHave you ever considered angels, Burakh? How do you imagine them?
6192355001403710 I don't imagine them. They don't exist.
6192355001403711 Chubby cherubs with wings and golden curls. Why?
6192355001403712 Why even ask? You don't believe in God, oynon.
6192355001403713 An angel is a nightmare. Their purpose is to instill primal, oppressive horror.\nI think if angels existed, they'd resemble a divine pillar of light—from the heavens to the earth. Devoid of anything remotely human.
6192355001403714 But inquisitors are people.
6192355001403715 Get a hold of yourself, oynon.
6192355001403716 …You're drunk, aren't you?
6192355001403717 Where's the Inquisitor? Has she been here?
6192355001403718 No.
6192355001403719 Listen, I…
6192355001403720 You do understand she has authority over you, right?
6192355001403721 Weird…
6192355001403722 We're not too fond of inquisitors. If she ran into Longin's people, she's probably dead.
6192355001403723 And where's General Block?
6192355001405072 How about a drink, buddy? A drink of water… or something stiffer, if you aren't cheap as hell?
6192355001405073 I got nothing.
6192355001405074 Was there a fight here? Who fought?
6192355001405078 We fought ourselves. It's our boys against our boys now. Don't ask stupid questions.
6192355001405079 Any survivors?
6192355001405081 The fighting moved toward the Factory. And ended there, I guess.
6192355001405082 Don't worry, soldier. You'll survive. Maybe.
6192355001405083 Is that sand pox really… transmitted by thought? Heard about that?
6192355001405085 It's not a pox.
6192355001405118 Got a smoke?
6192355001405119 No.
6192355001405120 Here's some water.
6192355001405121 Say, did a civilian come through here? With papers for the general?
6192355001405122 For the general? Maybe. The general's in the Town—look for him there.
6192355001405123 Where exactly?
6192355001405124 Just wash your hands, and only drink water that's been boiled.
6192355001405125 It is. So think less. That'll protect you.
6192355001405151 …
6192355001405152 Anything else?
6192355001405153 Where's General Block?
6192355001405154 …Perhaps she didn't try to meet him in person after all? Has a courier been here?
6192355001405155 He went out to restore order. Longin's people had three outposts in the Town, so he could be at any one of them.\nInquisitorial couriers have been here. They went after the general.
6192355001405156 Looking for Block? Did they split up?
6192355001405157 Couriers? With the Inquisitor's papers?
6192355001405251 And who might you be?
6192355001405252 Name's Barley. I'm in charge now.
6192355001405253 You're on Grief's throne…
6192355001405254 He's busy kneeling at the Cathedral. Ran off to rat us out, the slippery bastard. I own this place now, so talk to me or walk. Don't care which.
6192355001405255 To the Cathedral? He couldn't have.
6192355001405256 Don't worry, pal—we can still deal. I've got bullets and blades for anyone who can pay. Cash up front, of course.
6192355001405257 Got many customers these days?
6192355001405258 Why did he run away?
6192355001405259 Lots. So don't go pissing me off.
6192355001405260 I've got bigger fish to fry…
6192355001405261 Fine.
6192355001405262 That's unfortunate.
6192355001405651 Any guns in stock?
6192355001405652 So what, you want a treat an' a pat on the head? Hope you didn't strain a muscle bashin' theirs.
6192355001405653 That's fine, I'm used to it.
6192355001405654 …You're welcome.
6192355001405655 Did… did my salvation come at the cost of you gettin' your hands bloody? Dirty business…\nYou know what… here. Have this gun. Will at least help keep things cleaner next time… maybe.
6192355001405656 Is this... a shotgun? And here I thought you weren't a murderer after all.
6192355001405657 Guess I'm not a villain anymore. My conscience is burnin' like a witch…
6192355001405658 You've never been a villain. A crook, sure. But not a villain.
6192355001405661 There won't be a next time.
6192355001405663 And here I thought you pawned your conscience years ago.
6192355001405666 How are you…?
6192355001405667 ...
6192355001405668 Grief, I… the Warehouse gang has a new leader now.
6192355001405669 One of my lot?
6192355001405670 Yes.
6192355001405671 Not anymore.
6192355001405672 That's all right. My lot can be trusted. And if they're not mine, who cares.
6192355001405673 Wake up! I didn't lock up your warehouse.
6192355001405674 Well, in that case, buy yourself a ticket in the front row! Gonna be a real show, those vultures fightin' over meat, or shivs, or…
6192355001405675 You abandoned them yourself. Stop whining.
6192355001405676 Honestly, as long as I can buy ammo there, I don't care that much who sells it...
6192355001405677 You always gotta have it your way… There's some undeniable freedom inside you.\nRemember my Piecework?
6192355001405678 The guy I extracted a shiv from?
6192355001405681 The guy whose guts I cut out?
6192355001405682 That's the one. I asked a favor of you, an' you had it your way… No lies, sort of. You get it? That's it: inner freedom. Miles above the rest of us.
6192355001405683 That's the only way I know, Grief...
6192355001405684 Here's what I'm thinkin', Cub. God gave you golden hands, so you became a healer. If you had bear paws, you'd be a gravedigger.\nWhy did your old man send you away? 'Cause you're his successor. And naturally talented, to boot. You catch my drift?
6192355001405685 I think so…
6192355001405688 No.
6192355001405690 Point bein', you never had a choice. Your path was tailored for you, with a pretty bow on top.\nBut who's the tailor, Cub?
6192355001405691 Who?
6192355001405692 I don't know...
6192355001405693 I don't know either! Fate?
6192355001405694 What do you think of <i>your</i> fate?
6192355001405695 I used to be a thief, yet they made me a storekeeper. And what a perfect fit I made!\nI got my Warehouse kingdom, and with it, the insides of the Town's great machine. I kept Vlad's riches while havin' all I could dream of. Can't imagine a sweeter life.
6192355001405696 So what in the world are you unhappy about?
6192355001405697 Was I tailored for that life, then? The fit <i>was</i> perfect.
6192355001405698 I guess so.
6192355001405699 If the fit was so perfect, what are you doing here? Go back to the Warehouses.
6192355001405700 I don't want it anymore. I don't want that fate. I want a <i>choice.</i>\nOnly, I'm danglin' from a string, Cub. Just like you. We're bound.
6192355001405701 So what would you have us do? Run away, hoping the strings tear?
6192355001405702 Well, I know I didn't run far. The moment the grip loosened, I stopped—and… well. Here I am, sittin', nice an' quiet…
6192355001405703 To hell with this <i>freedom,</i> then.
6192355001405704 You really ought to stop this.
6192355001406351 
6192355001406352 
6192355001406353 
6192355001406354 
6192355001407551 I don't.
6192355001407552 Already done. Your warehouse is quiet now.
6192355001407553 Whoa... That was fast. Did you expect me to ask?
6192355001407554 I kind of did. You never wanted to mingle with that crowd.
6192355001407555 Nah. I just didn't like how they looked at me.
6192355001407556 Well... Thank you, Cub, for cutting this string. One fewer now. Perhaps one day I'll even be able to move on my own...
6192355001407557 Keep going, pal. I can tell something's brewing inside you.
6192355001407558 You'd better. I can't always be your errand boy.
6192355001407559 
6192355001407560 
6192355001407561 Grief is no longer a leader of bandits. Seems like the silly man's decided to become a monk… Not sure if I should laugh or cry.
6192355001407562 Grief… Where does your free spirit take you? Out of the frying pan, into the fire. She seems to have damaged your mind.
6192355001407851 
6192355001407860 
6192355001407861 
6192355001407862 
6192355001407863 
6192355001407864 
6192355001407865 
6192355001407866 
6192355001407867 
6192355001407868 
6192355001407869 
6192355001407870 
6192355001407871 
6192355001407872 
6192355001407873 
6192355001407874 
6192355001407875 
6192355001408151 …Worst of all, the smell. Can you smell it? Gunpowder…
6192355001408152 You've been banished to a corner, I see.
6192355001408156 I can.
6192355001408157 I'm fine with the corner. This corner of the world, anyway. What's so bad about it? Corners are cozy. And I don't need much.\nAt least they still let us work… somewhat.
6192355001408158 "They," who?
6192355001408159 Where did you send Grace, the cemetery girl?
6192355001408160 They who smell of powder.\nI remember you, by the way. You were worried about Grace, right? The cemetery girl?
6192355001408161 Yes. Where is she?
6192355001408162 She's now Peter Stamatin's ward.\nDon't give me that look. Does it seem so unthinkable? So surprising?
6192355001408163 …Unthinkable, to put it mildly! He's a drunk and… who knows what else! Definitely not the nurturing type.
6192355001408164 Yeah… a bit.
6192355001408951 Pochard
6192355001408952 Pochard
6192355001409253 How's she doing here?
6192355001409254 She gave me a brilliant idea.
6192355001409255 Let me guess… to quit the booze?
6192355001409351 Quiet… Quiet…
6192355001409352 How are you doing, kid?
6192355001409353 We're fine.
6192355001409354 Who's "we"? You're alone here.
6192355001409355 You look very pale. Do you have all you need here? Food?
6192355001409356 See that little blade of grass growing through the floor? That's Peter.
6192355001409357 The place is a mess… no wonder there's grass growing here!
6192355001409358 Yes. That was his name.
6192355001409359 I'm his keeper now. He wants me to go to the Tower.
6192355001409360 So <i>that's</i> why you're barely alive. You need to get some good sleep. You hear me?
6192355001409361 Don't. I'll take you in… if we survive all this.
6192355001409362 He's my family now.
6192355001409363 Take care, kid.
6192355001409365 Not at all. He's a living person.
6192355001409366 Meaning?
6192355001409368  
6192355001409369  
6192355001409370 He's real. But I don't know how to care for him! I'm used to singing lullabies, but I don't know what to do with the living! Do they like lullabies?
6192355001409371 Of course. Even adults need them, sometimes.
6192355001409372 You'll have to learn, Grace.
6192355001409373 Peter will teach me. It's warm here. I… I like this place.
6192355001409374 You're a good kid.
6192355001409375 Peter? I'm not sure he's good at teaching communication…
6192355001410651 The crowd has lost their minds… They believe the plague can be purged with fire, along with anyone infected.
6192355001410652 Well… in a way…
6192355001410653 Have you heard, doctor? People have completely lost faith in you. We've taken up the good fight ourselves—with fire.
6192355001410654 What fight?
6192355001410655 Hey, uncle! Let's play firestarters. Take a pebble. If you get a red one, you're sick. Black, and you're a firestarter. We use sticks for bottles.\nGet hit, and you're dead. If you're sick and touch a firestarter, they get infected, too.
6192355001410656 What firestarters?
6192355001410657 Did you come to hand me the papers designating the bombardment target? The justification for a surgical strike, signed by the state inquisitor?
6192355001410658 Yes.
6192355001410662 We're talking about the war.
6192355001410663 The war?
6192355001410951 
6192355001410952 
6192355001410953 
6192355001410954 
6192355001410955 Kayura
6192355001410956 
6192355001410957 Crow

6192355001410959 Dove

6192355001411151 Prompter
6192355001411152 As you should know, lateness leads to darkness, Burakh. But worry not: I have a lantern here for you.
6192355001411153 Am I late?
6192355001411353 Hey, not fair! You've only got red pebbles there!
6192355001411354 You go ahead. I have enough on my plate already.
6192355001411355 Everyone wants to play as a firestarter! It's boring to be sick.\nFolks say the firestarters are sick, too. The plague doesn't kill them; it whispers to them, tells them to burn folks so they suffer less. It's kind.
6192355001411356 The plague doesn't know kindness.
6192355001411358 You play funny games.
6192355001411359 People are frightened for their lives. If a thug attacks you with a knife, will you turn the other cheek? Sand plague is worse than any knife.
6192355001411360 No. I won't.
6192355001411364 You doctors stand around watching <i>microbes.</i> It's we who suffer. You stash away medicine while we're all on our own…\nPersonally, I'm too scared, but there'll be others. They'll burn the sick. They're beyond salvation, anyway—we remember the First Outbreak. But we'll at least protect ourselves.
6192355001411365 We study microbes to <i>save</i> you assholes.
6192355001411368 It's not about faith. If you crave violence, you'll find any excuse.
6192355001411579 There you are… It's good to have a chance to say my goodbyes. I'm leaving. Remember me fondly, Cub.
6192355001411580 Leaving…? With the Army?
6192355001411581 With the Army.
6192355001411582 To war?
6192355001411583 To war.
6192355001411584 Are you mad?
6192355001411585 Where are you going?
6192355001411586 You're surprised? I've always wanted this. I'm made for the military.\nWhere else would I go? I've done enough here for people to avoid looking at me wherever we meet. Elsewhere, it'll be easier to forget.
6192355001411587 Will you at least tell me what you did?
6192355001411588 Got a death wish?
6192355001411589 Maybe I do.
6192355001411590 You idiot!
6192355001411591 No. The secret's not mine alone. I'd betray someone else's trust.
6192355001411592 So that's your decision… and it's final?
6192355001411593 It is.
6192355001411594 <i>Absolutely</i> final?
6192355001411595 I have something else in mind for you.
6192355001411596 You have something to say on the matter?
6192355001411597 Not really… Except that I do respect your decision. You're a free man—free to do what you think is right. Goodbye, Stakh.
6192355001411598 What if I offered you another life?
6192355001411599 I need an assistant.
6192355001411600 What if you became my student? I'll mold you into a decent doctor in less than three years. Finish what Father started.
6192355001411601 Do you disrespect me <i>that</i> much?
6192355001411602 It's a sign of respect!
6192355001411603 You're just… dear to me, that's all.
6192355001411604 Don't you think this is your duty?
6192355001411605 …You surprised me.
6192355001411606 So what do you say?
6192355001411607 Do you need some time to think?
6192355001411608 You've truly taken his place. Your father's, I mean.
6192355001411609 So that you can take mine.
6192355001411610 I need you, Stakh.
6192355001411611 The Town needs you. I… can't do everything on my own.
6192355001411612 Fine. I agree. Now go; I need to wait for the officer.
6192355001411613 To send him to hell, hopefully.
6192355001411614 See you around, Stakh.
6192355001411615 I know the word. It's from a tale! Or a riddle, maybe…
6192355001411616 What tale?
6192355001411617 "The udurgh has a special mound, his ear sticking from the ground. Just make a wish and grab the mud until your hands are filled with blood."\nIt's about the old village! So I guess the udurgh is there… 
6192355001411618 How do I get there?
6192355001411619 What riddle?
6192355001411620 The old village? But it's been dead for so long… 
6192355001411623 You're not trying hard enough. How about stamping the State Inquisitorial Seal on your forehead? <i>That</i> would look official.
6192355001411624 Don't give me cheek, Burakh. I won't have it. You are to report to me here daily. Any more quips, or are we done?
6192355001411625 No. I'm good for now.
6192355001411626 I understand. Report daily—will do.
6192355001411627 I've got more… but I think I can hold them back for a bit longer. See you around.
6192355001412351 
6192355001412352 
6192355001412353 
6192355001412354 People say Anna went to the river at night to drown mice. Guess she hopes to cure herself.
6192355001412355 Cure herself by drowning mice?
6192355001412551 Where's Aglaya? I mean, the Inquisitor? Like, the commissar?
6192355001412552 She sent three people after the general to deliver orders of some kind. Then she left herself, too—after them, I guess. To our blighted headquarters, where else?
6192355001412553 What orders?
6192355001412554 Just orders, somethin' about the bombardment. It's not like she reports to me. I just keep my eyes on the ball…\nIt's about the Polyhedron, I think. It bothers her. Sometimes it even seems like that's why she came to the Town at all… You know how it is with them. There's always a mask behind a mask.
6192355001412555 Shit, this is dangerous! Headquarters won't be happy to see her.
6192355001412559 …Sit with me, brother.
6192355001412560 Huh?
6192355001412561 I mean it. Come on, sit. They're draggin' you down your path, so don't go. Imagine how shocked they'll be when you don't listen!
6192355001412562 No one drags me. I make my own choices.
6192355001412563 No, Grief. I need to go.
6192355001412564 Don't go. Let them break their fingers… Or are you just a puppet?
6192355001412565 You're a puppet.
6192355001412566 That's it. I've had enough of your puppet talk.
6192355001412570 She went on her own?
6192355001412571 Now isn't the time to get sentimental.
6192355001413251 
6192355001413252 
6192355001413254 Someone's wailing inside.
6192355001413751 He must have done something... awful to anger you this much.
6192355001413752 So there's still a chance, eh? Means he's not dead yet after all.
6192355001413756 I've been to the steppe. I went searching for an aurochs. What's going on in the Warrens? The Termitary, I mean.
6192355001413757 I don't know. But all Kin seem to be there… locked up. Which is good—it saved their lives. Why do you ask?
6192355001413758 …Because you are Isidor's son. His charge now rests on your shoulders. And you… you're still so little… Mother Boddho help us all.
6192355001413759 Better yet, you help me. There must be some sort of unusual blood around here…
6192355001413760 Do you know what an udurgh is?
6192355001413764 My father was murdered.
6192355001413765 An aurochs? But they went extinct <i>years</i> ago! Were you actually looking for one? <i>Why?</i>
6192355001413768 Overseer Tycheek… no. Taya—his daughter. That's who I need. That's who I'll go to the Termitary for.
6192355001413769 There are so few of us left, Artemy, son of Isidor. Do you understand that only a few hundred people in the world know our tongue? That only a few dozen remember our stories? That less than a dozen can interpret them?
6192355001413770 Stop pushing me.
6192355001413771 Taya is there. A girl from Father's list. That's why I'll go.
6192355001413772 I am a broken man—that's who I am. And you are not, Kindred, but tomorrow you will be, too. And then nothing will ever be fixed.
6192355001413773 Tomorrow I'll <i>break?</i> Why the hell would I?
6192355001413774 I've been told you were in the Termitary.
6192355001413775 There's an outbreak in the Town. Did you not know?
6192355001413776 Do not look at this wound, Kindred. Go and do the deed.
6192355001413777 Let me examine you.
6192355001413778 Do you have a home?
6192355001413779 Go.
6192355001413780 Where will I find you later?
6192355001413851 
6192355001413852 
6192355001413853 
6192355001413854 
6192355001413855 
6192355001414264 The steppe is beautiful in fall… and fall is the season of truth. In fall, we keep our promises. Own our deeds… Our crimes. Cleanse our mistakes.\nA good season.
6192355001414265 I know who you are. You're the Foreman of the Abattoir.
6192355001414266 I'm Isidor Burakh's son.
6192355001414276 Wait, Kindred. Look carefully. Not at me—at Earth.\nThe Lines have brought us both to this dead place. I do not like it. So, before you ask anything, tell me: why have you come?
6192355001414281 I'm making a cure for the sand pest. I need blood. Unusual blood…
6192355001414292 Wrong. You will one day accept authority over the Kin, so that they live. This is essential. Nothing is more important. It is the only way for our people to survive.
6192355001414293 Our people are doomed.
6192355001414301 I'm a doctor, not a ruler.
6192355001414302 I'd like to see Fat Vlad's reaction to <i>that</i> idea.
6192355001414303 Tycheek knows not the Lines. He struggles to choose one way or the other. Your father had skill. He knew the Lines far better than me. And so do you. Your heart chooses right. \nTycheek would acknowledge you, would speak to you on behalf of all Khatanghe. I would support you and explain everything to him… but they would not let me inside the Termitary.
6192355001414304 Who?
6192355001414306 Obviously. It's quarantined.
6192355001414307 They shot me with a rifle. The bullet lodged itself beneath the ribs. Nothing I can do now… Since when do we use weapons? What madmen grabbed knives? How do they intend to live here, after that?\nI don't understand. What can I do? I can overpower six people with my hands alone. But I can't shoot.
6192355001414308 Let me see your wound. I'm a surgeon.
6192355001414309 What would you have me do?
6192355001414310 You haven't answered my questions.
6192355001414311 The Kin will. Your father was with them on the eve of his… death.\nDo as I ask of you.
6192355001414312 What?
6192355001414313 Say it out loud. You know the answers, but you won't tell me. Is that how it is? I don't like it.
6192355001414314 Try to get inside the Termitary—you'll find a way. Seek out overseer Tycheek. We need to wield power over the Kin, to find an agreement.\nSeveral thousand people are in the Termitary. Olgimsky's Town, the Town of Humans, is dead. We will enter the Warren. Then we will again emerge, and take what is ours. Do you understand?
6192355001414315 Aspity—Sahba—she wanted the same.
6192355001414316 No. I don't want this.
6192355001414318 Isidor would go.
6192355001414319 Don't try to pressure me, Foreman. I don't take kindly to it.
6192355001414320 Fine. I'll go. And then you'll answer my questions.
6192355001414321 What for?
6192355001414322 If the people do not accept you, it's useless. How can you understand us? How can you learn our lifeblood? The knowledge of Earth, of the udurgh, is meaningless when you're alone. When you're confused, unable to share responsibility.\nWe are all responsible. Merge with the Kin. Merge with Earth. Then we'll speak… Kindred.
6192355001414323 I understand… Kindred. I'll find Father's murderer. And we'll seek vengeance together.
6192355001414324 I don't exactly like our people. But I want to understand Father. And finish his business.
6192355001414325 Unless you're dead by then. Since you refuse my help.
6192355001414326 I know.
6192355001414327 Who did it?
6192355001414328 Any trickle of blood seeps from Olonngo. From the Abattoir. Always. Blood means the Abattoir.\nBut no one can get in there now.
6192355001414329 But this blood came from beneath the ground.
6192355001414333 You want to know the truth? Of your father's death? His duty? His path? What it means for you… and for me?\nThen stop acting out, Kindred, and do as you must.
6192355001414334 …What?
6192355001414335 What did you say to me?
6192355001414336 I don't let people talk to me like that.
6192355001414337 Blood medicine, you say? Good.\nWell. I am the Foreman of the Abattoir. My life is blood. I've cut open more bulls than you could ever see in your life. My arms are elbow deep in blood. My legs, knee deep.
6192355001414338 So where does it come from?
6192355001414351 You all lost it while I was gone.
6192355001414852 Where's the commissar? Aglaya Lilich?
6192355001414853 I'll shine a light for you. If you do not believe your eyes, I'll <i>make</i> you see the stage is clear!
6192355001414854 Where's the Inquisitor?
6192355001414855 I thought you'd never ask! Her Cataclysmic Majesty would like the army band to play her tune. She sent three copies of her songbook, on the backs of three couriers, and then moved on ahead to conduct this choir herself.
6192355001414856 Enough with the comedy, where is she?
6192355001414857 You'll find the maestra in the Town Hall. The Town will shake from root to root when mighty trumpets ring the air!
6192355001414858 What concert?
6192355001414859 The Symphony of the Falling Tower!
6192355001414860 …She's destroying the Polyhedron?
6192355001414861 Bravo! Bravo!
6192355001414862 I'll stop this circus.
6192355001414863 Huh…
6192355001414864 What sheet music?
6192355001415551 Who is she, then?
6192355001415552 She never was one.
6192355001415553 You know nothing of her! This cursed town smothered her. Forced a stupid role on her. She got it in her head that she had to be anyone but herself. That's the kind of town we live in…\nShe used to be different. Completely different…
6192355001415554 Earth spoke to her. Most people would find that unbearable.
6192355001415555 What was she like before?
6192355001415556 Well… Earth won't speak to her anymore. Or to anyone else.
6192355001415557 There'll be other Mistresses in the town. Leave them alone. And Katerina… she'll start by bringing the Cathedral back to life.
6192355001415558 How?
6192355001415559 Who do you think you are, expecting me to talk about my wife with you?
6192355001415560 A member of the community who expects to know how you're planning to govern us.
6192355001415561 I'm sorry.
6192355001415562 Oh no…
6192355001415563 You'll see.
6192355001415564 Something feels wrong about it.
6192355001415565 Just tell me she's not religious. Anything's better. Even a second plague.
6192355001415566 …Sometimes I feel like I was born to be a widower.
6192355001415567 You never know. You've got your whole life ahead of you.
6192355001415568 You still have the Town.
6192355001415569 Is that so?
6192355001415570 Was he ever? I mean, it's just a title…
6192355001415571 He's a ruler now. <i>The</i> ruler. The Bull Enterprise is destroyed. The Olgimskys are over. The Kains… are no longer on this side of the river. Everyone's scattered, like children after a game ends…\nBut my husband alone would never abandon his duty. His town.
6192355001415572 Didn't take you long to label everyone traitors.
6192355001415574 He really is an honest man.
6192355001415575 The Olgimskys were always the guts: hot, alive, feeding the Town. The Kains were the nerves: spark and potential. People cling to the belly for warmth. They grasp at the nerves to reach beyond themselves. \nBut no one ever dares to touch the bones.
6192355001415576 The bones are your family, I guess?
6192355001415577 Surgeons do.
6192355001415578 Yes. My husband is this town's spine. And now, with that horrible weight lifted from him… he will straighten.
6192355001415579 Sounds uncanny.
6192355001415580 Your husband is a man of honesty and resolve. He'll make a good ruler.
6192355001415581 And our town is no longer a town. Without Alexander, it will run a few minutes more, like a headless chicken, then fall…
6192355001415582 Yes. Your husband was a strong man.
6192355001415583 No. But it will be different.
6192355001415584 Don't you mean "seventy-five"?
6192355001415585 Mother said she'll teach me numbers. Father will do letters. Then they'll let me get back to work. I'll stay at the cemetery and count the dead. Count them, and then write it down.\nThat's fine. If that's what I need to do to go back there, I'll do it.
6192355001415586 "Mother"? "Father"?
6192355001415587 …Did they tell you that from underground? Do you still… talk to them?
6192355001415588 My foster parents. Alexander and Katerina. The governor's family took me in.
6192355001415589 …They couldn't have said that.
6192355001415590 So they adopted you too, now? It never ends…
6192355001415591 Why?
6192355001415592 Katerina's dead.
6192355001415593 Alexander's dead.
6192355001415594 They're both dead.
6192355001415595 So what?
6192355001415596 Oh… I forgot who I'm talking to. So they adopted you?
6192355001415598 Only, I don't want to leave that nice apartment with the pictures. It smells so sweet: paint, twyrine… carraway, for some reason. And there's music in the window.\nBut Katerina says I can't stay there. She says we have to be together.
6192355001415599 She's right, I guess.
6192355001415602 You could run off at night.
6192355001415604 You know, I pressed my ear to the ground today, as I always do… and something has changed. There used to be a murmur, but now it's gone. Do you think it's because there are too many of them now?
6192355001415605 It was… an underground heartbeat. It has stopped.
6192355001415606 You know… it'll be calmer for them now, in this new Earth. I think.
6192355001415607 Can't we just have a normal town, for normal living people?
6192355001415609 Simon was better than me. He did what I never had the courage to do: thrust a knife into his own firstborn. He couldn't bear the infant's scream, but still…\nStill, he succeeded. Simon Kain and Isidor Burakh vaccinated our town against death.
6192355001415610 You mean… You know everything?
6192355001415611 That vaccination cost you the Polyhedron.
6192355001415612 The Polyhedron was a glass bottle. A clepsydra. A compass. A work of exquisite craftsmanship… but merely a tool, like this town. The first of the many steps on this ladder.
6192355001415613 I thought you stored something precious inside that bottle… but whatever.
6192355001415614 My brother and I have been preparing to face a catastrophe like this for many years. We knew that only people whose lives were imbued with meaning and purpose could survive it. People with bowstrings for souls.\n…I never imagined that there'd be so many survivors. Truly, we live in the best of possible worlds.
6192355001415615 …And not a single word for the person who actually saved them.
6192355001415616 But even more are dead.
6192355001415617 Maybe you're right… about the purpose.
6192355001415618 We ascended—one step. A single step, but a crucial one. The mission of House Kain on this side of the river is over.\n…So why does Simon, my dear twin brother, still haunt me in my sleep?
6192355001415619 My dreams are bitter, too.
6192355001415620 It's called "love," Judge.
6192355001415621 Perhaps you'll be at peace on the other side of the river.
6192355001415622 I'm glad we agree on this, Judge.
6192355001415623 I always knew that, deep down, you didn't really love our town. And that one day, you'd abandon it.
6192355001415624 I loved it less than Simon did.
6192355001415625 Love hurts, huh?
6192355001415626 …I know.
6192355001415627 …They were always driven upwards, and that's what became their downfall. Too straightforward an interpretation. We need to follow the magnetic lines—they are the nerves of the earth.\nWe'll make a massive glass podium in the center. Like a lens, you see? And inside it, a compass.
6192355001415628 Drawing a plan for the future?
6192355001415629 There are no more nerves… The Earth is dead. It lost too much blood.
6192355001415632 Blood is only food for the spirit. For as long as we stand on this ground, its gravity exists, driving us down. While we are driven, we live.
6192355001415633 So it's a sentient corpse, now? Better than… just a corpse, I guess.
6192355001415634 A curious way of looking at it.
6192355001415635 We've done too much looking and not enough listening. Yes, that's it! Sight is humanity's primary sense, so it impedes us. Too simple, crude.\nIn our new town across the river, we won't let ourselves rely on sight.
6192355001415636 You mean that… literally?
6192355001415637 You're right. What is essential is invisible to the eye. It's felt, in the bone.
6192355001415638 How primitive of you.
6192355001415639 Look, I'm just happy you're not going to gouge your eyes out.
6192355001415640 Excuse me, then.
6192355001415641 We will not govern our new town. We need to find a way to avoid governing it… so it will govern us. Houses will write edicts. Streets will invent laws. Roofs, sentence criminals. \nDon't give me that look. But do come when our new town is complete. You'll be welcome.
6192355001415642 Sorry. No looks. You're biased against sight, I got it.
6192355001415643 Hm… I guess I'll drop by.
6192355001415644 Good luck.
6192355001415645 I meant the interesting parts of the Town.
6192355001415646 So did I.
6192355001415647 The Oneirotects?
6192355001415648 You're talking about the dingy part of the Town. Dingy and chaotic. Messy. <i>Our</i> town has no place for unnecessary things.
6192355001415649 Says the girl living in the abandoned observatory.
6192355001415650 Anyway, things went wrong with the Cathedral, somehow. It remained unfinished.
6192355001415851 How is it unfinished? It looks finished to me.
6192355001415852 It's empty and silent. Soulless. A week ago, I had a dream. I was walking down its aisle… or rather, falling. I woke up and thought… Ah, it doesn't matter.\nYou know, I think the Kains might take me with them when they leave for the other side. Us standing here together… it just feels right. They know I'm one of them.
6192355001415853 Is that so?
6192355001415854 We'll build a new town across the river! Iridescent, and specular, and transparent… Well, they'll build it. I'll just listen and tell them if they've gone too flat or too sharp. 
6192355001415855 Congratulations on the new job.
6192355001415856 Well… good luck, girl with a soul.
6192355001415860 One stroll around the Crude Sprawl and you'd see just how interesting it can be.
6192355001415861 Dingy, but alive.
6192355001415862 And useless.
6192355001416852 Whatever you say. Your choice.
6192355001416853 I am no human, but a bull. Olonngo is my home. So while the Ford is closed, I will remain here.
6192355001416854 You know what? Go to Father's house. It's vacant—no one will bother you. You can rest there.
6192355001416855 All right. Stay here then.
6192355001416856 …You're offering me your own house?
6192355001416857 Yes.
6192355001416858 Father's house. You two were friends. He'd do that for you, too.
6192355001416859 Truly you sense the Lines, Khatangher… I suppose I should come there once again. To remember… and to endure the pain.
6192355001416860 Come… Kindred.
6192355001416861 Settled, then.
6192355001418251 Well, they're made of bones.
6192355001418252 I'm dying, Ripper. Only a tiny drop remains. Like someone cleaved me in half, and it all spilled out.
6192355001418253 I don't believe you. You aren't the type to be destroyed so easily.
6192355001418254 Were you really the plague, then?
6192355001418255 Hey, are there… two of you?
6192355001418256 There's only one half of me left.
6192355001418257 The better half, I hope?
6192355001418258 I'm not the plague. Do you still not get it? My sister was… and I'm the good one… Was the good one.
6192355001418259 Yeah, sure. Blame it on an evil twin.
6192355001418260 You're an idiot, Ripper! A dull, insufferable idiot. All that talk of rivers of blood… that's not what this story was about at all!\nYou have <i>no idea</i> who's up above us! No idea who you <i>actually</i> killed!
6192355001418261 "Above us"? So who's up there?
6192355001418262 I know all too well.
6192355001418263 Someone you weren't even <i>invited</i> to meet! But they're waiting for me… Poor souls… And now I'll never come…
6192355001418264 That's fine. You'll sit this one out and find a way to get there.
6192355001418265 Well… Maybe one day I'll figure out <i>your</i> side of the story.
6192355001418266 …I'm sorry.
6192355001418267 I wouldn't call it an invitation.
6192355001418268 A powerful performance requires a strong entrance.
6192355001418269 Entrance, pah… I feel like I'll <i>exit</i> that place feet first.
6192355001418270 We'll see.
6192355001418271 I've improvised once or twice already… and yeah. I think I'll pass now.
6192355001418272 Do you know her?
6192355001418274 Aglaya Lilich? As an inquisitor, you mean? I don't know.
6192355001418275 You don't know if you know her or not? What do you mean?
6192355001418276 Can't argue with that.
6192355001418277 You mentioned working for the inquisition.
6192355001418278 I did indeed perform certain services… errands, really. But that doesn't mean I understood them. Doesn't mean the opposite, either.\nYou'll see for yourself soon… and if you don't, you'll sense it. You're the kind to think with your heart.
6192355001418279 Intriguing.
6192355001418280 Hands, not heart. But I'm flattered anyway.
6192355001418281 Look for openings?
6192355001418282 They recruit children?
6192355001418283 You can't be a creator and a critic at the same time. To create greatness, you must ignore the minutiae. Work in wide strokes.\nBut… inquisitors eat into everything, like vinegar, lingering on every detail. They find a blemish, a flaw, then claw at it until you're finished.
6192355001418284 Do you know her?
6192355001418285 Sometimes.
6192355001418286 And you know this inquisitor personally?
6192355001418287 At one degree of separation.
6192355001418288 That doesn't count.
6192355001418289 I see…
6192355001418290 I'm not that easy to claw.
6192355001418291 I'm not sure I agree about creators and critics.
6192355001418292 Why? What does Peter have to do with her?
6192355001418451 
6192355001418452 
6192355001418951 One apostate is dead.
6192355001418952 Two apostates are dead.
6192355001418953 Three apostates are dead. One more will be enough. They'll get the message.
6192355001419651 Thank you. You are free to go.
6192355001419652 Yes, sir.
6192355001419653 …I don't feel free at all. My fate drives me.
6192355001419851 Yes. It's been a rough September.
6192355001419852 Why defeat it?
6192355001419853 Life's more interesting this way.
6192355001419854 Well, maybe…
6192355001419855 You know, fellow traveler? You should talk to my new friend. His name's Bachelor Dankovsky. Really big on the whole "fighting death" thing.
6192355001419856 Oh, I know. I'll get to him right after I've finished with you. He's smarter than you are.
6192355001419857 Every other person is smarter than me here…
6192355001419858 Just be careful around him. He's a fussy sort of person… Delicate.
6192355001419859 Sounds nice, but it doesn't hold up. The common cold can sometimes kill a person.
6192355001419860 A boundary… Good word.
6192355001419861 It <i>is</i> good.
6192355001419862 So… What now?
6192355001419863 I'm stupid. I have no talent. I… should never have even come here.
6192355001419864 Where will you go then?
6192355001419865 To the heart of the Town. The central square. To, I don't know… the Theatre. I don't have much of a choice.
6192355001419866 Don't worry. You'll have a choice there.\nBesides, you've already done all you can. All that's left is… a bit of business to wrap up. Things that concern you alone. And you… who are you? Who cares about you?
6192355001419867 I see.
6192355001419868 It's true. I'm no one.
6192355001419869 You know what? I actually like myself. I've walked my path well these past eleven days. I can respect myself.
6192355001420051 Relax. She won't bite.
6192355001420253 Words, words, words.
6192355001420254 Tenegh…
6192355001420255 Hush, you'll destroy my focus. Scientia potentia est. "Ski-EN-ti-a"…
6192355001420256 Enunciate that "ski" more crisply, maybe?
6192355001420257 I never thought you… rehearsed all that.
6192355001420751 She threw some… sack into the Gullet. I don't know what's inside.\nWe have a custom. To avoid bad fortune, one must drown a mouse. You see, trouble grabs its tail, thinking it has grabbed luck. By the time trouble realizes its mistake, the flow of water drags it away. So she must be drowning mice, even though we don't believe such customs.
6192355001420752 Yeah, you clearly don't.
6192355001420754 We don't have mice around, though. Only jerboas.
6192355001421251 To hell with secrets. But you do have a place in this town.
6192355001421877 Bou khara, bou shagna… Aydahamni khurene. I fear Earth is dying. Mother Boddho sinks into the depths. People begin to fear me. Look through me. Cross the street to hide from me. No one needs me. No one wants me.
6192355001421878 They fear what they don't understand. Who are you, truly?
6192355001421879 I am… Sahba Usp'tae. Flesh of Earth's flesh. Mother Boddho gave you a piece of herself, so that you may have a mother. That was me. Unente, today I return to Earth. Sahba is ubshe… A shabnak tale to frighten children…
6192355001421880 Don't go.
6192355001421881 Be khara, I shall go blind, deaf. I was part of your journey. Yet you left me by the wayside.\nLet that be so, emshen. I changed for you. Mother Boddho spoke to you through me. But if you need not a mother, then she need not speak to you.
6192355001421882 But you can see and hear me just fine, Sahba. What are you talking about?
6192355001421883 <i>I</i> need you.
6192355001421884 Boleesh, boleesh, byy alysh… When a child is alone, calling Mother, calling Father, unable to walk. Can't walk… Unente, all is foreign when you are abandoned.
6192355001421885 Is that child you?
6192355001421886 I'm sorry…
6192355001421889 The Kin needs you. They are yours, now.
6192355001421890 Bou khara, do not watch. Bou shabna, do not listen. Oshysh daa: Go. Please. Bayartay, khybyyn. Khayratay inagni, let your step be warm.
6192355001421891 Very well… khetey.
6192355001421892 I don't believe you! You're human, and you'll remain human. Or become human.
6192355001422451 Bayartay…
6192355001422551 I do! I know you don't believe me, but I need you!
6192355001422552 Your friend valued it. What if Khan gloated over Jester's death?
6192355001422553 Jester cannot die.
6192355001422554 Good for you.
6192355001422555 Those who spend all their time up high, fall really hard in the end. That's how you get your dream dome smashed to bits. Bad idea! In the end, all dreamers walk the same earth, and I'm in charge of this here earth. Dealing in dreams? Nah, not for me.
6192355001422556 You're not the only one in charge.
6192355001422557 Of course. There's also you. I really like you! Just look at your Half! It clearly shows your quality of character.\nSo you're with us now, yes?
6192355001422558 So you accept me into the Soul-and-a-Halves?
6192355001422559 Will <i>you</i> take <i>me</i> into the Kin?
6192355001422560 Why would you want that?
6192355001422561 I'll build warehouses. Just think about it.
6192355001422562 We already have warehouses. Why build more?
6192355001422563 No. But you can hang around.
6192355001422564 And what will you store there?
6192355001422565 I'll have a warehouse full of everything. Every miraculous thing. You know? Rarities and oddities.\nCrucially, those'll be <i>things.</i> Material objects, not ethereal reflections of dreams like Khan's. Things! Get it? Have you ever run your hands over cloth? Smelled walnuts? Seen a piece of carnelian?
6192355001422566 Ambitious and open-minded. I like it.
6192355001422567 Huh… I thought you were a gang leader, but you're more like a poet.
6192355001422568 Some people like their dreams. Keep that in mind. Not everyone will follow you, at least not right away.
6192355001422951 Doghead
6192355001422952 
6192355001423051 I am not human, Kindred. Look at me. I am an animal. Sometimes, too, people take me for a Worm. A halfbreed, between man and bull, they call me.
6192355001423052 Why would I look at you?
6192355001423053 Why would I listen to you?
6192355001423556 
6192355001423557 
6192355001423558 <i>The Shelter smells of gunpowder. Rusty iron. Snowmelt by a brick wall. A whole year.</i>
6192355001423559 
6192355001423560 
6192355001423562 Who in the world is she planning to kill? Lara, you idiot…
6192355001423563 
6192355001423564 
6192355001423565 The Army has split. Fighting among themselves, frightened witless, the heroes. General Block has been arrested.
6192355001423566 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001423567 Lara… I've forgotten about her.
6192355001423568 
6192355001423569 
6192355001423570 The children have tracked a murderer. They said he'll come to "Friday's yard when pigs fly overhead." Guess I'll have to wait a bit.\n\nCould it be <i>the</i> murderer…?
6192355001423571 The children have tracked a murderer, the one who put creepy notes in their stashes.\n\nCould it be <i>the</i> murderer…?
6192355001423572 The children have tracked a murderer, the one who put creepy notes in their stashes.
6192355001423573 
6192355001423574 
6192355001423575 …I was looking for a murderer. He expected a thief. So we've met. What the hell?
6192355001423576 
6192355001423577 
6192355001423578 What the hell was that? Who was that? He had nothing to do with anything. These children…
6192355001423579 
6192355001423580 …I was looking for a murderer. He expected a thief. So we've met.
6192355001423581 <i>A heart held in hands. Can you hear the water splash? Come to us. Please. Please. It's me, Capella.</i>
6192355001423584 
6192355001423585 
6192355001423586 Victoria Olgimskaya's daughter is our new Mistress. Why do children have to take after their parents?
6192355001423587 <i>You haven't come… I'm sorry. I'll try not to see you anymore… if I can. It was me, Capella. Victoria.</i>
6192355001423593 This is a bizarre time that started with the courageous "do as you please" and delved into "this is the only way to go." I'm not sure anything <i>I</i> wanted to say found its way here.
6192355001423594 I see.
6192355001423651 
6192355001424151 
6192355001424152 
6192355001424153 
6192355001424154 
6192355001424451 Who are you?
6192355001424453 I don't know.
6192355001425053 You've lived too soberly as it is.
6192355001425054 I don't want to live anymore, Cub. I just… don't. Life has lost meaning.
6192355001425055 This too will pass. Believe me, Lara.
6192355001425056 Have I?
6192355001425057 You've never been overly sentimental, that's for sure.
6192355001425058 No, I'm sorry. That was stupid of me to say.
6192355001425059 Of course you have. You're clear-headed. Determined.
6192355001425060 What experience?
6192355001425061 The outbreak. All eleven days of it.
6192355001425062 Don't worry. Things will return to normal, eventually…
6192355001425063 What did you expect? People are people.
6192355001425064 Sobering… It should be sobering. Those are the people you wanted to serve. That's what they're like! I mean, what <i>we're</i> like.
6192355001425065 No. It will not. It's all gone now.
6192355001425066 Even so, it's better then death. Even if it's more… exhausting.
6192355001425067 No, it hasn't. We need to rebuild. Make it as it was before, but better.
6192355001425068 Consider it a vaccination. They always hurt, always make you feverish.
6192355001425069 But what were we vaccinated against, Cub?
6192355001425070 I don't know… The past, I guess?
6192355001425071 The earth. So we can keep our feet planted.
6192355001425072 Whatever it was, we needed it to have the right to try something new.
6192355001425073 You know what else I've realized? No one needs me here. I'm useless. Whatever I do, it only makes things worse. It's either stupid, or ridiculous, or fruitless… No one needs me.
6192355001425074 Hey, don't lose heart, sister! Come on, cheer up. Never say that again.
6192355001425075 That's not true. I need you.
6192355001425076 It will pass… Believe me. Come here, come here. Let me hug you.
6192355001425077 Thanks. I could use a hug.
6192355001425078 There. Much better.
6192355001425079 I… I can't raise my hands! Hey! What sort of trickery is this?
6192355001425080 What's wrong? You don't have to hug me if you don't want to…
6192355001425081 It's like… like something won't let me!
6192355001425082 I… I remember now. He said I wouldn't be able to hug anyone. Damn it…
6192355001425351 If you like me so much, perhaps Jester will finally show himself?
6192355001425352 That's up to him.
6192355001425353 "Cats know the fact of the matter…"
6192355001425552 Bobhead
6192355001426151 He's not here.
6192355001426152 You're alive…
6192355001426153 So? Did they execute her?
6192355001426154 Whom?
6192355001426155 Er... the mistress of the house.
6192355001426156 Who?
6192355001426157 What for?
6192355001426158 Who are you?
6192355001426159 What are you doing here?
6192355001426160 I mean… this is a public shelter, isn't it? "Home for the Living"? Means anyone can come in. Like, if you got your house burned, or want to escape quarantine. That's what she said.\nAnd now she's asked someone to replace her.
6192355001426161 Why?
6192355001426162 So, here's the thing. The mistress of the house, she said, "I'm gonna go kill the general. 'Cause the general, he put my dad, Captain Ravel, through a court martial, for insubordinate conduct, and then my dad got sentenced and executed as a traitor and deserter."\nAnd then she said, "Fate sent him to me now. General Block, that is."
6192355001426163 Kill the general? What do you mean, kill the general?
6192355001426164 But <i>who was executed?</i> Tell me, now!
6192355001426165 Just like that. Got herself a gun and went to the headquarters… And to us, she said, "Take my household, and manage it well." So that the whole shelter thing wouldn't end with her, right…\nSo now we're having a look around… Sorry if we disturbed anything.
6192355001426166 The shelter thing… <i>The shelter thing…</i>
6192355001426167 Oh, why do you have to be such an idiot, Gravel!
6192355001426168 What were you thinking? How could you let her <i>go?</i> You morons!
6192355001426169 So she went to the headquarters? The Town Hall? Was it long ago?
6192355001426170 I mean… You won't catch her on time, unkind sir. Half an hour ago or so.
6192355001426171 Half an hour…
6192355001426172 No. No! This is insane!
6192355001426173 Get lost, all of you.
6192355001426174 You idiot… Oh, what an idiot! You got a death wish?
6192355001426175 What have you done…
6192355001426176 They've done him in. Without me.
6192355001426178 I've failed. I've failed…
6192355001426179 You should be thanking heavens you've failed!
6192355001426180 But you wanted to do it yourself, didn't you? Bet you were planning to shout something, too. Make sure he knew what he'd die for. Yes?
6192355001426181 Are you arrested?
6192355001426182 What do you have here? A revolver? Give it to me. Discreetly.
6192355001426183 I couldn't do anything. I came in, waited here. They asked what I wanted. I said I wanted to see the general. And they laughed… said it'd be a long wait.
6192355001426184 Why?
6192355001426185 Yes.
6192355001426186 Why aren't they throwing you out?
6192355001426187 Come on. Let's go from here. All right? It's over, now please… come.
6192355001426188 There's a mutiny. A rebellion. I've overheard.\nOnly, it's not real… They told the soldiers that the general caught the plague, so they're leaving. But he's not sick. They've arrested him. To leave the Town, you see?
6192355001426189 I see full well…
6192355001426190 They don't care. They're no longer the military.
6192355001426191 What makes you think so?
6192355001426192 Really? They look military enough to me.
6192355001426193 Good riddance. Now let's go…
6192355001426194 Only, here's what I think. Longin, the mutineers' leader, was Block's executive officer. His loyal watchdog. Father wrote that he'd go through hell or high water for the general. Meaning…
6192355001426195 What?
6192355001426196 We really need to leave. Now. Please?
6192355001426197 It's not a mutiny. They seized him to make sure he doesn't have to disobey orders.\nThey adore him. General Ashes. A beloved general. They removed him from dirty work to make sure he has an excuse. That he's safe! That's he's not punished when they return!
6192355001426198 Stop shouting! They'll hear… Quiet!
6192355001426199 So let them. Let them leave without a bombardment. But Gravel, dear, please… sweet Gravel. Let's go, you shouldn't be here…
6192355001426200 And that means he'll escape with his whole hide! Safe, with a clean reputation!
6192355001426201 He'll meet his fate sooner or later. Come on, that's enough war for you for today.
6192355001426202 No one will escape this meat grinder whole, Block least likely of all. Neither will you if you keep standing here. How much time do you think they need to notice what you're hiding under your shirt?
6192355001426205 It's all pointless… All pointless.
6192355001426206 To the contrary. Such events follow a particular… line, so to speak.
6192355001426208 Still, hand me that pop gun of yours. And no "buts."
6192355001426209 What happened to your father, anyway? Was that the story you didn't want to tell me when I arrived?
6192355001426210 Yes. And I don't want to tell it now.
6192355001426211 Are you absolutely sure that Uncle Ravel was… by Block?
6192355001426212 Yes. It was written in the orders. We were sent a letter. Court-martialed. Sentenced to death by firing squad for disobeying orders.\nAnything else you'd like to know? If Father truly was innocent? If the sentence was just? If that was the right thing? Go ahead, don't be shy!
6192355001426213 Be quiet!
6192355001426214 How about shooting me now? While you're on fire and everything!
6192355001426215 …I'm sorry.
6192355001426216 What happened to the general?
6192355001427151 
6192355001427251 Like a child? Don't you hate children?
6192355001427252 I'm only joking. I'd rather like some candy, though…
6192355001427253 Should I tuck you in, too?
6192355001427254 Absurd! We never kidnapped anyone. They tagged along of their own accord.\nNo, rather… I'm not from no Caravan. Never was such a thing, sawbones. It's a myth. I just like children. I'm kind and tender like that.
6192355001427255 You like children, you say…
6192355001427258 …And sing me a lullaby.
6192355001427259 Y'know, children <i>are</i> rather ruthless creatures. Cruel, too. I'm starting to doubt my decisions.
6192355001427261 If nothing else, you can act. That was a masterful depiction of a child.
6192355001427263 Conscience is a hell of a thing. Like the gap between trapeze bars, it doesn't forgive.\nSorry, circus joke. You wouldn't get it.
6192355001427264 Always thought of my conscience as a presence rather than a void, myself.
6192355001427265 A drunken mind speaks a sober heart, indeed.
6192355001427266 Yes, sweet pea. Come on, let me hold you.
6192355001427267 Hmm… I must go out. I must see her.
6192355001427268 Whom?
6192355001427269 My tower.
6192355001427270 You won't see it. It's no longer there.
6192355001427271 All right. Go.
6192355001427272 You're a cruel man, Burakh. Can't you see I'm mad? Would it be so difficult to play along for a bit? Then I could believe in a miracle… for a few minutes longer.
6192355001427273 The Kains want to build a new town across the Gorkhon. You should go with them.
6192355001427274 You're a kind man, doctor. She's no longer there. And yet here you are… playing along… as if I'm a child. Tell me… How is she?
6192355001427275 You'll build a new one. The Kains will support you.
6192355001427276 We didn't see eye to eye, the Judge and I. He argued that the Tower was never their family's crowning achievement… merely mine. And I concur. It was my crown. I've hit the ceiling…
6192355001427277 So then you did see eye to eye…
6192355001427278 And so you gave up?
6192355001427279 Yes… We shared the same opinion. Where's the inspiration in that? Consensus is an anchor…\nSay, Burakh. Why do they say miracles have abandoned the steppe?
6192355001427280 Because there won't be any more twyrine to drink.
6192355001427281 It's the price we paid for curbing the outbreak.
6192355001427282 So my glass miracle vanished alongside your steppe miracles… You know, Burakh? Don't say anything. Let it be so.
6192355001427283 Yes, Peter. Your tower vanished along with our miracles.
6192355001427286 There are no miracles, Peter.
6192355001427287 Have you ever lost everything?
6192355001427288 Recently, yes.
6192355001427289 Fine. Have your drink. We'll get back to this tomorrow, when you're sober.
6192355001427290 Don't you see we're having a conversation here?
6192355001427291 I do.
6192355001427292 Stop trying to provoke me. It won't work.
6192355001427294 If anyone is to write about me, I'd like it to be you, Yulia. At least nothing will be overdramatized.
6192355001427295 The work will be, of course, scientific. But the title…\nI'm thinking about throwing the scientific language out the window and giving it an old-fashioned name: <i>On the Connection of Everything.</i> What do you say?
6192355001427296 Well… You're the author. I guess it sounds nice.
6192355001427297 Thank you.\nI think the academic world in the Capital may have a couple questions regarding the subject of my research. Perhaps you'd like to come with me? As an assistant and… well, the subject.
6192355001427298 Like a rat? I'll pass, thanks.
6192355001427559 You're late.
6192355001427560 Well, it's not like I've missed my train…
6192355001427561 What? Did the play start already?
6192355001427562 Who knows…
6192355001427563 I was busy.
6192355001427564 On the contrary, the play is over. And, yet again, it's over because you have failed at your task.
6192355001427565 Shame about that.
6192355001427566 You were late! You didn't make it in time, do you understand? A theatre is all about being <i>on time!</i> To the minute! Being late is unforgivable. One person is late, and everything is ruined.\nYou've let everybody down. Everybody! I don't even know how I'm supposed to go on working with you. It will never come to anything, this way. Anything <i>whatsoever.</i>
6192355001427567 I'm afraid I'm hopeless.
6192355001427568 …I am forced to cancel the rehearsal. You're free to go.
6192355001427569 Actually, I think it's better this way.
6192355001427570 Actually, I wasn't planning on coming here in the first place.
6192355001427571 What's wrong this time?
6192355001427572 No, I haven't.
6192355001427573 I don't know what you want from me.
6192355001427574 What bliss. Free at last!
6192355001427575 Is this another one of your techniques?
6192355001427576 No, I'm done with techniques. I'm letting you go.
6192355001427579 What now?
6192355001427580 I'm not in the habit of lying.
6192355001427581 You've ruined everything for me… Everything. This entire production—the action, the challenge, the pain and peril, the brilliant blasphemy—it was all for the sake of the experiment.\nAnd I told you about it! It was a test! A test of humanity's limits. An exercise in transcending those limits. You failed.
6192355001427582 Failed it how?
6192355001427583 All of… who? This place is always pretty empty.
6192355001427584 Damn… I think I'm starting to understand.
6192355001427585 Did you make a deal? Here on this stage? Did you? Answer me!
6192355001427586 Yes. I did.
6192355001427587 So what if I did? It's not like you ever explain anything!
6192355001427588 I was… having a hard time with all those additional burdens.
6192355001427589 Of course, it was hard! That was the idea behind your ascension! How can anyone be made to feel the heroic torment of Sisyphus if they're given a paper boulder to roll?
6192355001427590 But why? What's the point?
6192355001427591 I thought it was part of the show.
6192355001427592 Maybe… maybe. This production had quite a number of, shall we say, <i>unplanned parts.</i>
6192355001427593 So what now?
6192355001427594 Because… because in this play, death becomes your partner! Understand? Humanity's most immutable, unconquerable limit!\nYou and death are in dialogue, don't you see? So how do we make your triumph convincing? How can you make it feel real? <i>How?</i> I'm asking you—<i>you!</i>
6192355001427595 You tell me!
6192355001427596 And so you lost. Everyone lost, because of that.
6192355001427597 Why?
6192355001427598 I don't know, all right?
6192355001427599 I wasn't exactly playing games, here!
6192355001427600 The moment you die, you come into contact with death. What kind of contact? A moment of valor, or idiocy? No one knows! But it is a brush with death. Thus, a connection—a state of attainment. Understand?\nBut why am I even asking you? I still don't entirely understand this myself!
6192355001427601 Why all the dumb burdens, then?
6192355001427602 I… I wasn't exactly playing games here, either!
6192355001427603 Why are you so upset, pal?
6192355001427604 So you're trying to say… that's how you defeat death? Are you joking?
6192355001427605 Why does life get harder with all these… layers? These repetitions? These continuations, these intersections… They're a goddamn mess!
6192355001427606 I told you, didn't I? It all went right over your head. We needed it for… candidness! For understanding! For the connection, and the attainment! Not to mention the <i>experience.</i> \nAnd here you are. I'm disappointed in you.
6192355001427607 So what happens now?
6192355001427608 Now? Now I'm going to work with someone else, obviously. I'm not interested in you anymore. Not interested in you as a character, you understand? A character. Not a human. You're simply too… dense.
6192355001427609 You'll work with this one, I presume?
6192355001427610 Yes. I need someone who feels more indignation, respect, and reverence toward death than you. Someone… passionate, if you will.\nSo, with your permission, I'll get back to him and we'll continue discussing his part. And my new plans concerning his part.
6192355001427611 Ahh. He's going to put you through a world of hurt.
6192355001427612 Well, then. It's the best choice you could make. Keep working—I won't distract you any further.
6192355001427613 So, a new one… That means the old one existed for a reason, too.
6192355001427614 Yes. Possibly. I think so.
6192355001427615 Where do I get my exit fee?
6192355001427616 Well… Goodbye, then.
6192355001427617 That's regrettable. I am what I am…
6192355001427618 Go through that door—no, not the main entrance; the small one to the right of you. Into the storeroom. \nGet changed there, and then go back where you came from. You'll settle your account behind the same door. The Town is off-limits to you from now on.
6192355001427619 But what about tomorrow?
6192355001427620 It's not coming. Nor will there be any other… solutions. It's the price you must pay for your cowardice.
6192355001427621 Farewell.
6192355001427622 As you wish… but you're making a mistake.
6192355001427623 Good luck… on your next try.
6192355001427624 Hang on. We're going back!
6192355001427625 To the great expanse, where the real life is. Where there's real work waiting. For both you and me… It's going to be much more interesting.
6192355001427626 Who <i>are</i> you, Fellow Traveler?
6192355001427627 How are we suddenly inseparable?
6192355001427628 Why are you clinging to me, huh? What do you want from me?
6192355001427629 Wherever you are, there I am. That's how it's going to be now. Back in town, you could've shaken me off… You had the chance. A once-in-a-lifetime chance. But you didn't.\nWise choice. Now you're going to have to put up with me until the end. And not just you… Like I said, there, in the great expanse, the harvest will be more plentiful.
6192355001427630 So I'm the reason you're going back into the world?
6192355001427631 I really could've shaken you off? Buried you there?
6192355001427632 Plentiful…?
6192355001427633 You bet.
6192355001427634 Well, now that we're inseparable, I'm going to hold you tight, so you don't escape.
6192355001427635 I don't believe you. You're lying. And I'm never going to believe you.
6192355001427636 That's what I was talking about… Of <i>course</i> there will be work for you. For me, collecting my dues. For you, holding me back, if you so decide. You <i>are</i> a doctor, aren't you? A notorious lover of people.\nSo we'll both have jobs to do. Forever. Where we're returning to, it won't be fun and games anymore… I'm telling you, it's real life!
6192355001427637 Real, huh? Well… we'll see.
6192355001427638 I'm sick of your chatter. Since we're stuck together forever, you might as well shut up for a while, you leech.
6192355001427639 Let me get some sleep. At least you won't be in my dreams, Companion.
6192355001427651 Yawn
6192355001428651 Just keep in mind that not everything is connected. The pattern is more complicated. I'm saying this as a haruspex.
6192355001428751 It's all in the past now. The choice has been made. No point in regrets.
6192355001428752 I'm flattered. But I'd rather stay here… This place needs a vet.
6192355001428753 …
6192355001428754 A scientist, thrown into the jaws of Death, hoping against hope to defeat Death. Welcomed by Death, ridiculed by Death, taunted by Death, and… fooled by Death.\nIt's as if this heretic spat into a tower of flame, expecting, somehow, to put it out. This whole place is far too crowded with Deaths.
6192355001428755 You've aged over these last few days. Or are you just resigned, now?
6192355001428756 Imperare sibi maximum imperium est.
6192355001428757 I told you already… I don't speak that barbaric tongue.
6192355001428758 Nookherni… Nүnehen zayla. It'll be fine.
6192355001429851 
6192355001429852 
6192355001429853 
6192355001429854 
6192355001429855 <i>Candles of every color. I'm waiting for you at the Cape now.</i>
6192355001429856 <i>Mother is watching me once again. I'm waiting.</i>
6192355001429857 
6192355001429858 Talon
6192355001429859 Beak
6192355001430851 
6192355001430951 Nothin'. I don't want to do anythin' at all.
6192355001430952 I've been meaning to ask you. Why'd you go to her in the first place? She was an authority, and you…
6192355001430953 …A thief. An' not just any thief, but a kingfish. First at the gallows. That what you mean?
6192355001430954 Yeah.
6192355001430955 My thoughts exactly! That's why I went.\nYou're no player, Cub. If you know your hand will lose, get it over with so you can pull new cards. <i>Then</i> you can make a move. That was my plan, anyway… but that's not how it shook out.
6192355001430956 How did it go?
6192355001430957 Didn't you see? I went to her ready to play cards, but she played checkers instead. Scratch that… She played <i>me,</i> like a damn flute. I couldn't have known.
6192355001430958 Well, she's not around anymore. Don't you want to go back?
6192355001430959 You worry me. You've always been weird, but you used to be lively, too.
6192355001430960 You're an idiot, Cub. While I was there, I realized how that giant clock operates. I used to think that I understood it, but it's only now I truly do.\nI used to be the clocksmith, oilin' the Town's gears… and I'll stay a clocksmith, only a different kind. You see?
6192355001430961 No. But I hope I will.
6192355001430962 So you've got a new grasp on time? Sounds good.
6192355001430964 There's nothing to do here, anyway.
6192355001430965 Why not just sit a while, soak up the mood? No need to make tracks.
6192355001430966 Speaking of tracks… What do you plan to do with your life now?
6192355001430967 Same here. I'm depleted.
6192355001430968 Idiot.
6192355001430969 Idiot, idiot, idiot… Do you know other words? Like you're such a genius.
6192355001430970 Well, I sort of am.
6192355001430971 Nah, I'm no less an idiot than you.
6192355001430972 If you need me, why didn't you call?
6192355001430973 It felt more exciting to wonder.
6192355001430974 Huh. Is it really you? Never heard you utter that word.
6192355001430975 I heard you adopted some kids? Orphans?
6192355001430976 Well, I didn't <i>adopt</i> them. They just kinda… crawled into my life.
6192355001430977 I prefer to keep things simple.
6192355001430978 I did.
6192355001430979 Where'd you hear that? Why would I want kids?
6192355001430980 Well, I've said it before. Maybe five times or so.
6192355001430981 Do you count your every word?
6192355001430982 Once a year while I was away, I bet. "I wonder where that idiot is…"
6192355001430983 How will you raise them? Some father you are…
6192355001430984 I'll figure it out.
6192355001430985 It's not complicated. You feed them and wipe their noses. They handle the rest.
6192355001430986 I think these kids have already raised themselves.
6192355001430987 Want my help?
6192355001430988 As in…?
6192355001430989 As in <i>just</i> help, you idiot! I just want to be useful. Make it easier for you and maybe lighten my own life a bit. You know…
6192355001430990 I do. And I agree.
6192355001430991 No. Those are my cubs.
6192355001430992 That's unexpected, coming from you. I'll think about it.
6192355001430993 No.
6192355001430994 We'll get to that tomorrow. Today, let's rest.
6192355001430995 I command you to never call me that again.
6192355001430996 I humbly accept your every word, oh wisest of the wise, and obey.
6192355001430997 Come on, drop it.
6192355001430998 Are you all right, Stakh? Angry with me again?
6192355001430999 Well, is there something to celebrate that I've missed?
6192355001431000 Depends on how you look at it.
6192355001431001 We're alive. Isn't that enough?
6192355001431002 You're right. There's nothing to celebrate.
6192355001431003 …You shouldn't have stopped me.
6192355001431004 I stand by my choice.
6192355001431005 Do you even believe yourself?
6192355001431006 You're right, I shouldn't have. What good is your moping? A doctor should be lively. They must inspire confidence. That's what Father used to say.
6192355001431007 …Or maybe you did right.
6192355001431008 Let's wait and see. Time heals all wounds.
6192355001431009 Don't give up on yourself. It's not over for you yet.
6192355001431010 Let your work be the judge of that.
6192355001431011 …You turned out just like your father, in the end. You even talk the same.
6192355001431012 …Thank you. I wanted to.
6192355001431013 No. I'm different.
6192355001431014 You're the one who resembles him, not me. Believe it or not, that's why I asked you to… well, to stay with me.
6192355001431015 Who <i>are</i> you?
6192355001431016 A person.
6192355001431017 Who are <i>you?</i>
6192355001431018 I told you already.
6192355001431019 Where are you?
6192355001431020 Here.
6192355001431021 Back here. I came round, I guess.
6192355001431022 I was desperate, at first. I thought we'd failed utterly.\nLike the astronomers of old, you know? The eclipse is short, it ends in the blink of an eye, and we missed the chance to observe and calculate everything we needed… and the next opportunity is a century out.
6192355001431023 Observe what? Calculate what?
6192355001431025 The following is a certificate of confirmation: This is to confirm that you, here present, declined the terms offered to you and, in order to alleviate your predicament, refused the task incumbent upon you based upon the number of your encounters with death.
6192355001431026 And…? What's with the pomp and circumstance?
6192355001431027 Uh… I didn't…
6192355001431028 Aren't you worried your beak will snap off from all that self-importance?
6192355001431029 …In reciprocity for said alleviation, you, here present, agreed to waive an important future event in what might be termed your destiny, the nature of said event being unknown to you. Confirmed by the present document as well as your facial expression.
6192355001431030 Yeah, that's right.
6192355001431031 That expression is extreme skepticism, beakhead.
6192355001431032 And this is that event. Right?
6192355001431033 …And now this event has come to pass. The game is over for you at this point. Tomorrow has been canceled, as have all subsequent days.
6192355001431034 Harsh. So can I go now?
6192355001431035 Looks like death, pal.
6192355001431036 Exactly so. This decision is final and without appeal.
6192355001431037 Come on… I was just about to make a complaint.
6192355001431038 Well… there's no arguing with that, I suppose.
6192355001431039 A deal's a deal. It's only fair.
6192355001431040 Wanted to cheat, did you?
6192355001431041 Huh? What do you mean by that?
6192355001431042 I did, of course. Who wouldn't?
6192355001431043 I didn't cheat. All I did was take the path of least resistance.
6192355001431044 You turned down a good thing. You shouldn't have. So, remain yourself now, as punishment.
6192355001431045 What good thing?
6192355001431046 You're afraid of death, then?
6192355001431047 I am.
6192355001431048 No. I'm not.
6192355001431049 You are… Everybody is. No fan of the Reaper, are you?
6192355001431050 Not terribly.
6192355001432752 
6192355001432753 
6192355001432754 
6192355001432755 
6192355001432851 
6192355001432852 
6192355001432853 
6192355001432854 
6192355001432855 
6192355001432856 
6192355001432857 
6192355001432858 
6192355001432859 
6192355001432951 So you've come…
6192355001432952 Yes. I have.
6192355001433051 No. Not a fan.
6192355001433052 We have a special relationship. It's a professional thing.
6192355001433053 What kind of professional runs from death? Talk about not putting your burial coins where your mouth is…
6192355001433054 It's not something I'm running away from.
6192355001433055 They say running does your health good. Proven fact.
6192355001433056 Not the worst of options.
6192355001433057 It was what I wanted in the first place. To remain myself, at all times.
6192355001433058 That's the problem, you're past explaining! Your insides are full up, no more room to stuff in this knowledge. So don't take it personally! I'm not trying to be mean, I just can't tell you. It is impossible.
6192355001433059 As you wish, then.
6192355001433060 It's all right. I'll figure it out on my own. That smart-looking guy over there will tell me. Won't be able to resist telling me.
6192355001433251 Nice meeting you, fellow traveler. How's it going? Enjoying the play?
6192355001433252 What are you doing here?
6192355001433255 Where's the director?
6192355001433256 It's not going particularly well, as you can see.
6192355001433257 The director went out to have a smoke. Got exhausted watching your torture.\nSo here I thought, how about I pay a visit to my fellow traveler? You must be exhausted from his… unique vision.
6192355001433258 Very much so.
6192355001433259 You don't say! The man's weird… How did it even occur to him? A person stumbles, and instead of lending a hand, he pushes them down further? Pours oil under their feet?\nIt's completely beyond me.
6192355001433260 I'm less than a person to him.
6192355001433261 Eh… I've seen worse.
6192355001433262 Listen, fellow traveler… I have a proposal. And I'll be blunt.\nWould you like to stop all this torture, the punishment? The hunger, the pain, the divine plagues of Egypt you endure for each new death?
6192355001433263 What do you mean…?
6192355001433264 I think… the idea is I'm supposed to value life higher because of this.
6192355001433265 Exactly what I meant. I'll replace you. I'm itching to act…\nYou'll become strong again. No more hunger pangs. The bony monstrosity we've all seen out on the square will vanish.\nAnd you'll no longer be punished for mistakes. You're about to perish without a single achievement… Look how pale you are. No offense.
6192355001433266 What bony monstrosity?
6192355001433269 How would you even achieve this? By strangling the director?
6192355001433270 And you want my soul in exchange, of course.
6192355001433271 Nah, I'm a light technician here… Lighting the way, so to speak. Immortell will listen to me. Don't you worry about that.\nAll you need to give is your consent. No soul required.
6192355001433272 And no more stupid penalties? Where do I sign?
6192355001433273 All right, so what's the catch? Don't say there isn't one.
6192355001433274 Huh… I thought you were a rag-and-bone man.
6192355001433275 If we strike this deal, you'll be free to die as much as you can bear. You can become Death's next-door neighbor, so to speak.\nBut in exchange, you'll lose something. Something big and important. And I won't tell you what it is. It might hurt incredibly. Or not at all.
6192355001433276 And here you were saying you didn't want my soul.
6192355001433277 "Give me what you don't know you have at home." Yeah, I've heard this one.
6192355001433278 Hm… I'll be the only one to suffer loss, right? No one else gets hurt?
6192355001433279 Pull the cloth out of your brains and think about it. Hard. These aren't just words. I <i>am</i> taking something from you, the <i>real</i> you. No huge loss, though… Maybe!\nBut you'll be free to walk the Town. Take risks, get into fights, be daring.
6192355001433280 Deal. Not for myself, but to get better at helping others. All these shackles slow me down.
6192355001433281 Deal. It's too hard.
6192355001433282 No deal. You want to take something, the absence of which would turn any victory to ash. I don't know what, but I sense it.
6192355001433283 Are you sure? I'll only offer once. You won't be able to change your mind or rewind time.\nThe choice you make now will stay with you until the end.
6192355001433284 I'm sure. I'll manage without shady proposals.
6192355001433285 No deal. Tedious bullshit is better than the fear of uncertainty.
6192355001433286 Are you sure? You won't be able to change your mind or rewind time. The choice you make now will stay with you until the end.
6192355001433287 I'm sure. No more penalties for death. In exchange for… something.
6192355001433288 You know… I've changed my mind. I'll try to bear all this… creativity.
6192355001433289 You know… I've changed my mind. Let's make a deal. No more penalties for death. In exchange for… something.
6192355001433290 Go and act then, my fellow traveler.
6192355001433291 See you around.
6192355001433293 Fellow Traveler
6192355001433294 So you haven't even noticed? Impressively unobservant… but no matter. It will disappear anyway.
6192355001433295 So what do you propose?
6192355001433296 I know you can't help but mourn the losses. But you've preserved what was most crucial—the udurgh. Because the udurgh is us—people. Children. We'll grow and build a new town—better, more balanced.
6192355001433297 Your words are cold… I think <i>you've</i> already grown up.
6192355001433298 No… I did a lot wrong.
6192355001433299 I can hear the White Mistress' voice.
6192355001433300 You're already building it.
6192355001433301 Where will you begin?
6192355001433302 Yes. You're right, Artemy.
6192355001433303 Where will you begin?
6192355001433304 I'll marry Caspar. The Kains and the Olgimskys will unite.\nThe Polyhedron, the Bull Enterprise… those were all cruel machines geared to produce utopias. Factories that processed people into ideas. But we'll make a world where people's bones aren't crushed under lofty words.
6192355001433305 But you don't love Khan.
6192355001433306 Don't you miss the Polyhedron even a little?
6192355001433307 You know, Victoria, you've started to take after your father.
6192355001433308 And you don't like me. Yet we'll be allies anyway.
6192355001433309 We'll see about that.
6192355001433310 No. It was a factory of fantasies. Beautiful, yes, but heartless. I know you didn't want to destroy it; perhaps you even regret it. But that trap suffocated children. You released them. That was a good deed, Artemy.
6192355001433311 I guess… You always know the right words to say.
6192355001433312 Not true. I admire you.
6192355001433313 Yes, White Mistress.
6192355001433314 When mother's radiance comes to full strength within me, I will fold my wings around my children, teach them to build, protect them from harm.\nThe Polyhedron, the Bull Enterprise… those were all cruel machines geared to produce utopias. Factories that processed people into ideas. But we'll make a world where people's bones aren't crushed under lofty words.
6192355001433315 Don't you miss the Polyhedron even a little?
6192355001433316 Nice speech.
6192355001433317 I'm not so sure.
6192355001433318 I think this is the first time you haven't yelled at me.
6192355001433319 I thought the Kains appreciated architecture.
6192355001433320 Oh, be silent. Why do you keep talking to me? Why do you think you're allowed to? No one <i>dared</i> harass Mother like that, but people like you are drawn to me. How can I teach you a lesson?
6192355001433321 Try hot iron. Or dumping boiling water on people's faces.
6192355001433322 Nina never shied away from people.
6192355001433323 Fine. I won't harass you.
6192355001433324 …But you see, Mother, this is precisely what makes it interesting. I don't want to move to the other side of the Gorkhon. It's too easy to step over the past. I don't like things too <i>easy.</i>\nThere are still so many people like this one here. Rough and dirty, ready be pressured into diamonds. All I need is a forge…
6192355001433325 Thanks, beautiful. I like you too.
6192355001433326 Can't you Kains live without <i>pressuring</i> people?
6192355001433327 …And you know, Mother, that forge is <i>me.</i> Sometimes I wake up with a burning in my chest, and the sky becomes crimson. In that very moment, if I kiss someone, they can see it too. It's true.\nThough I must admit, the first person I tried that on got insomnia and died a week later. But I'll try harder next time…
6192355001433328 If you need a volunteer to train with, let me know. I'd be happy to oblige.
6192355001433329 Crimson. Yes. Nina was Dark, but you're Crimson.
6192355001433551 Rat Catcher
6192355001433552 You're not the director.
6192355001433553 I'm the junior prop master. I select skulls for tragic monologues and banana peels for funny falls. And I shoo away… all… kinds… of rats!
6192355001433554 You have a vermin issue?
6192355001433555 He's back! He's back! So, did you catch your murderer? Your man of black?
6192355001433556 What is that supposed to mean? Who did you make me kill?
6192355001433557 We have this… little demon around. A repugnant creature! Even though I grew kinda used to it… But now it escaped from the Theatre into the big world! Slipped out! And I've no idea what he dragged with him.\n…Wait a second. It happened because of you, didn't it? You opened the door to come in—and he slipped out through the crack!
6192355001433558 I didn't come in here through the door. It works differently for me… somehow.
6192355001433559 I guess.
6192355001433560 Then it's up to you to find him! I'm not going outside, I'm too busy here.\nIt's unheard of—to have something escape into the Town from <i>our</i> theatre. It's never happened before. I shudder to imagine the consequences…
6192355001433561 By "your" theatre you mean this version… with the candles, right?
6192355001433562 So I'm free to go? There won't be any punishment?
6192355001433563 Yes. This one. It took me four hours to place the candles right, by the way, so don't you dare step on them.
6192355001433564 I won't. Am I free to go?
6192355001433565 So there won't be any punishment this time?
6192355001433566 Go. Shoo! The rat is out—that's your punishment. He's your headache now, if you find him.\nJust keep in mind… he's an actor too, in his own way. When he's in character, there's no use asking him about the Theatre of Death. Better try catching him somewhere nearby…
6192355001433567 "Theatre of Death"?
6192355001433568 Got it. Thanks. I prefer rat-catching to dying.
6192355001433569 Oh… no. Sorry. I misspoke. Anyway, why are you still here? Go!
6192355001433570 I think I understand. Kind of like "theatre of operations," yes?
6192355001433571 And good luck to you, too.
6192355001433572 Rat Prophet
6192355001433573 Just look at what you've grown! Unbelievable. The scale of your personality is staggering.
6192355001433574 Who are you?
6192355001433575 Aren't you the rat that escaped from the Theatre?
6192355001433578 Are you slow? The name's written on the right.
6192355001433580 I remember you. You're "the thing from below the ground." Or are you? Where did you get those legs?
6192355001433581 Yes. Yes, yes, yes. A child of old theatrical rags. The inhabitant of all musty places. The performer of a small but memorable role, "the thing from below the ground." Can't give you an autograph—I'm short of hands.\nEnough. This humble stage has objects more remarkable than me!
6192355001433582 Fair enough. What are these poles?
6192355001433583 The Rat Prophet, huh…
6192355001433585 Do you really have no hands…?
6192355001433586 Like you do! You swing your paws whenever the script allows, but you can't even punch Fat Vlad's face—or jerk my tail.\nAt least I got this magnificent costume for my suffering. What do you have?
6192355001433587 My clothes aren't so bad, either.
6192355001433588 I can do whatever I want. Or… at least I could before I got cursed.
6192355001433589 Fine. So what's that thing over the square?
6192355001433590 See this ulcer? A metastasis in the world's body. It grew because you keep dying, jackass.\nYour deaths are make believe, but the world rots for real. That's how big a character you are, Ripper. Impressive!
6192355001433591 I didn't understand a word of that.
6192355001433592 Wait, but…
6192355001433593 An ulcer! A tumor! An abscess! A boil! How can I make it more clear? And you call yourself a doctor…\nOr did you think your deaths only concerned you? An actor is inseparable from the audience—they're a manifestation of their expectations. So if you keep suffering, sooner or later everyone will.
6192355001433594 My mistakes hurt the whole world? That's not fair.
6192355001433595 More fair than you think. \nOh, but stop fretting. It's just a piece of wood. Or bone, maybe… some pranker just stuck it in the ground, that's all.
6192355001433596 But you just said…
6192355001433597 I'm not fretting.
6192355001433598 Look. Whenever you find yourself in the Theatre again and the stage is empty, know that I must be close. We'll continue our improvisation then.\nFor now, enjoy your freedom and have fun swinging your arms.
6192355001433599 I keep my arms in check. A surgeon's hands are too valuable a tool.
6192355001433600 See you around, then.
6192355001433601 I've been wondering… Perhaps you're doing this on purpose? Botching lines, falling from the stage? Constantly kicking the bucket?\nYou just want to see what it all leads to, don't you?
6192355001433602 I'm not doing this on purpose, no.
6192355001433851 Suspicious Note
6192355001433852 The handwriting is childish.
6192355001433853 "Found your thief. He'll come to Friday's Yard. Wait for him there. Just hit him first, he's a nutso. 450."
6192355001433854 Mysterious Note
6192355001433855 "The ripper's murderer will come to Friday's Yard when pigs fly. You hear that, ripper? We found him!"
6192355001433856 The handwriting is childish and rushed.
6192355001434051 You must think I'm nuts if you believe I'll just… let this slide!
6192355001434052 …Are you mad?
6192355001434054 Anyway. That was a good game. But we don't want to play with you anymore.
6192355001434055 Why the hell?
6192355001434056 Who was it?
6192355001434059 I don't want to play your games anymore, either. Good luck with your life.
6192355001434060 We took you in, and you were greedy! We told you, there were rules. And you haven't written a single note…\nYou didn't play fair. Yeah.
6192355001434061 So <i>I'm</i> the guilty one? Come on!
6192355001434062 A murderer.
6192355001434063 Who did he kill?
6192355001434064 You're no better. You told me you'd found a murderer… <i>the</i> murderer. Was that fair?
6192355001435251 
6192355001435252 
6192355001435253

6192355001435651 How about taking my place and trying for yourself?
6192355001435652 That thing above you… The ulcer… It became bigger.
6192355001435653 And do note a curious thing: it's not Earth rotting. It's Sky. This tumor is growing up.
6192355001435654 So what does it mean?
6192355001435655 Will it keep growing?
6192355001435656 Are you sure it's because of me?
6192355001435657 I don't know. I don't know anything. I'm small fry myself, Burakh… It's Burakh, isn't it?
6192355001435658 Burakh.
6192355001435659 I'm as much Burakh as you're the Rat Prophet.
6192355001435660 Tsk, tsk. You're late. For shame, sir. For shame.
6192355001435661 What's going on? Where am I?
6192355001435662 Let me through! I need to get back to town. I didn't make it on time…
6192355001435663 You're late. You quite definitively didn't make it. Come on in, collect your payment. Don't detain us further.
6192355001435664 Ugh.
6192355001435665 Is there really nothing that can be done?
6192355001435666 Was it that difficult a task? Not at all, if you ask me. Of course, it would've involved some legwork. But you were given enough time.\nAnd you never found those wretched papers, meaning you never wanted to. Move along.
6192355001435667 What's going on outside? What's the Town up to? Was it shelled, or not?
6192355001435668 I did want to!
6192355001435669 Town's gone, my dear. The show has been interrupted due to a lack of interest on the part of the protagonist. Right at the climax, too!
6192355001435670 Who does something like this? Stopping the whole thing just short of the denouement?
6192355001435671 Can I come back? Please? I'll act my part better. I'll find the papers.
6192355001435672 Whatever. I'm sick of your show already. Should I talk to Immortell, then?
6192355001435673 That's a question for you, sir. Not for me.
6192355001435674 I see. Well.
6192355001435675 It's nothing but questions with you people…
6192355001435676 You should be more careful, Burakh. I don't like this tumor at all.
6192355001435677 Neither do I.
6192355001435678 I'll try.
6192355001435679 Do you know how one can tell a simple mole from a malignant melanoma?\nIt's symmetry. Natural processes are symmetrical. An arm on the left, an arm on the right… Each action bears a symmetrical reaction… but illness is twisted. It grows to the side.
6192355001435680 Not all good things are symmetrical. To the contrary, actually…
6192355001435681 The heart is on the side, too. The left side.
6192355001435682 It's a myth, actually. The heart is located almost directly in the center of your chest. Some doctor you are…
6192355001435683 Almost. But not entirely.
6192355001435691 Farewell, Burakh.
6192355001435692 Farewell? Why?
6192355001435693 Farewell, Rat.
6192355001435694 The tumor is complete, see? The ulcer is ripe now. Grasping at the sky with its metastases, growing into it.\nNow it's sewn to the ground forever, unable to escape.
6192355001435695 That doesn't sound too bad.
6192355001435696 So now what?
6192355001435697 What does it have to do with you?
6192355001435698 Me… I'm just a trash rat, Burakh. Field voles make nests from herbs; I make mine from rot, so to speak. I'll climb up there and inhabit it. Spitting down rot on your heads from above, heh heh heh…
6192355001435699 How are you going to climb it? You have no hands!
6192355001435700 The tenant fits the house, I guess.
6192355001435703 It'll suck me in… and you, too… It'll suck the whole world in.\n'Cause you've rotted it all. It's all just metastases and tumors now. None of us will have hands or feet soon…
6192355001435704 Don't you try to shift the blame to me. I wasn't the one who made this plague happen.
6192355001435706 I'm sorry, funny rat. I hope you don't disappear completely.
6192355001435707 You grow gloomier each day, fellow traveler. Did anything happen?
6192355001435708 Lots of things. How's it going for you?
6192355001435709 Ah, fellow traveler. Look what I have here… a curious thing.
6192355001435710 What's so curious about a common belt?
6192355001435711 Want a riddle? A local kid told me.
6192355001435712 Sure. Surprise me.
6192355001435728 Why do you have that ridiculous grin on your face? What are you looking at? Isn't this what you wanted? Isn't this why you preserved the Town's seeds? There will be a harvest soon. It won't be long.
6192355001435729 I'm not sure… I guess you're right, that this is what I wanted.
6192355001435730 Fair enough… I wanted life to go on. So it does.
6192355001435731 You know, Ripper… You're not such a bad person. There was no love lost between you and my parents, but you helped them anyway. It's hard to protect someone you don't like. Harder than saving cubs. \nSo don't wander too far. We're still connected, you and I. And there's a great deal ahead of us.
6192355001435732 It's nice to be appreciated.
6192355001435733 You know, Ripper… You aren't such a bad person. You didn't even hesitate when you took that awful poison to protect the orphan girl. By the Crowstone, remember? That was very brave.\nSo don't wander too far. We're still connected, you and I. And there's a great deal ahead of us.
6192355001435734 It's nice to be appreciated.
6192355001435735 God forbid.
6192355001435736 God forbid.
6192355001435737 Now go. What will happen here is not for your eyes. Someone's waiting for you elsewhere. Can't you hear?
6192355001435738 I can.
6192355001435739 I can't.
6192355001435851 Yes, let's start slow. You won't be able to hug anyone anymore. Ever.
6192355001435852 Who cares?
6192355001435853 I don't have anyone to hug, anyway.
6192355001435854 Well… You won't be able to express affection. If you want to so much as hold anyone, you'll have to improvise.
6192355001435855 I don't "hold" people. I respect the boundaries of others.
6192355001435856 I'll figure something out. As they say: watch my hands.
6192355001435857 You know… That feeling when hunger turns to starvation, when it starts to kill you? That will come quicker now.
6192355001435858 That's all right. I'm used to an empty stomach.
6192355001435859 You walk his paths—Burakh's paths! And they are so very difficult. Each step drains your strength, drives you closer to death.\nThe paths narrow, shorten. You won't be able to meander as much from now on.
6192355001435860 What do you mean?
6192355001435861 That you're trying to trick me.
6192355001435862 Well done! And not entirely untrue. Not now, though; now, we work for real. Today's subject is attrition. Burden. Exhaustion.
6192355001435863 If anything makes me exhausted, it's this circus of yours…
6192355001435864 Work, then. Without me. Your play is here; I play outside.
6192355001435865 I walk my own path.
6192355001435866 I keep thinking… I've been exhausted for a year. And still…
6192355001435872 Could I have a different punishment instead?
6192355001435888 Life.
6192355001435889 You know things by touch. You can feel their attributes—clear enough to not confuse a precious item with trash. If you do, you'll spoil the end.
6192355001435890 Trash? Such as…?
6192355001435891 Such as a surgeon who can't tell a liver or a heart from wool. That trash. Such a person would turn our play into a puppet show for sick children.
6192355001435892 You'd make a decent Pulcinella.
6192355001435895 Well? What does it mean?
6192355001435896 In a theatre, everything is a prop…
6192355001435897 The world is dying in your hands. You're turning the living into the dead, while it should be the other way around. How do you do it?
6192355001435898 I'm doing everything as usual.
6192355001435899 I don't know. Somehow.
6192355001435900 What was I supposed to learn? How not to die?
6192355001435901 You're ruining the experiment. You're turning real acting into puppetry.\nYou have no right to do that—it's <i>so</i> disrespectful. Is it so hard for you to live? Inhabiting the current circumstances is your job! I'll give you one more try. Do better this time!
6192355001435902 I'm trying as hard as I can!
6192355001435903 Disrespectful? Look who's talking!
6192355001435904 Go outside and try surviving a day! That'll be a learning experience.
6192355001435913 Because outside the walls of the Theatre, the triumph of death is <i>real!</i> That is why you must act there, not here.
6192355001435914 Why isn't the stage enough?
6192355001435918 I need to work you loose. That's the whole point of the method. Simon's victory over death had nothing to do with him living past two hundred and eleven.
6192355001435919 He overcame death by accepting it? And then dying?
6192355001435921 Two hundred eleven? Seriously? I had no idea.
6192355001435944 Not <i>defeated.</i> Overcome. It's not the same. And, well, there are different ways.
6192355001435945 The Kains, for example, seem to believe that you only need to <i>want</i> hard enough, and you can achieve anything. The naivete…
6192355001437551 Look who's here… Time to get real, then. You wanted to come round. Let's see if it worked.\nSo, what do you think? Are you back?
6192355001437552 I don't think anything.
6192355001437553 "Come round"? I didn't faint.
6192355001437554 Back where?
6192355001437555 Is this some kind of game?
6192355001437556 What do you mean?
6192355001437557 I'm dead tired…
6192355001437558 Ugh.
6192355001437559 I'm… everywhere.
6192355001437560 No one.
6192355001437561 Artemy Burakh.
6192355001437562 A haruspex. A Warden. A Knower-of-Lines.
6192355001437563 The man who tore this town apart and bound it back together.
6192355001437564 Why do you ask?
6192355001437565 Humanity. Their limits. Their struggle to conquer death.\nThis play wasn't the best. A flop, honestly. But it wasn't useless. I see much clearer now… and I know how to improve it. The next show will be better!
6192355001437566 How do you see it going?
6192355001437567 So there'll be another performance?
6192355001437568 A flop? You're too harsh.
6192355001437569 We chose the wrong hero: someone who didn't fear death at all. Disrespectful, crude, and flippant.\nWe'll use a different archetype next time. A person obsessed with the idea of defeating death. Death's nemesis, so to speak… Someone who has <i>studied</i> it. 
6192355001437570 I think you're the one obsessed with death.
6192355001437571 Of course. The show must go on.
6192355001437572 Why? Wasn't this one tortuous enough?
6192355001437573 Uh huh. Good luck with the smartass. He'll surely win.
6192355001437574 Death cannot be defeated, but it can be overcome. Not by prolonging life, no—the struldbrug method is ridiculous and stupid. People aren't yet strong enough to bear their own internal hell, or rid themselves of it.\nThat's not how you overcome death. We've found the true way.
6192355001437575 I'm all ears.
6192355001437576 How many of you were here—the actors who played the Haruspex?
6192355001437577 I don't remember… I didn't count.
6192355001437578 One.
6192355001437579 None.
6192355001437580 I'm Burakh. I'm not an actor.
6192355001437581 Where was the real Haruspex?
6192355001437582 Around, somewhere… on his own.
6192355001437583 He belonged to history… or just a story? In any case, you knew about his adventures beforehand. You <i>planned</i> them.
6192355001437584 Gradually, the actor became him. They would only act the part while replaying a section… and <i>become</i> Haruspex upon unlocking new events.
6192355001437585 When one died, another took their place. This line is made of small segments. It could be infinite… if not in length, then in width.
6192355001437586 How does one overcome death?
6192355001437587 They're broken into many separate beings.
6192355001437588 They step out of their feeble body.
6192355001437589 They transcend the self. That's what the sand pest tried to do. Depersonalize us.
6192355001437590 The body is susceptible to death! As is the self. As is any being trapped within its bounds. They invite death the way a lantern invites insects!\nBut that which is broken into many bodies, many selves, many perceptions—<i>that</i> thing can resist it.
6192355001437591 You're right. To connect two things, you must first break them apart, because connection implies difference… and previous separation. Only connections defeat death.
6192355001437592 That sounds too complicated.
6192355001437593 This makes no sense.
6192355001437594 But this doesn't solve the death of the physical body, and bodies matter. Even towns have bodies. Even people who become towns do.
6192355001437595 "I have been in a multitude of shapes, before I assumed a consistent form," as an ancient poet once said. Who are you?
6192355001437596 Whoever.
6192355001437597 I'm Artemy Burakh.
6192355001437598 That's no one's business but mine.
6192355001437599 This question is a trap.
6192355001437600 Our work here is done. You can go to the dressing room and take off the costume. Remember the place? It's where you started.\nGood luck. And thank you for taking part in our daring experiment.
6192355001437601 No. I've found myself, and that's who I'm going to stay. I am Artemy Burakh. I don't want to take this mask off. I'm going back to the Town. Back there I'm expected… and loved.
6192355001437602 Thank you. The act has worn thin, and I don't want to play anymore. So I guess I exit through the small door to the right—the dressing room… and go back home.
6192355001437603 Another trap? I don't want to choose a door. What if I stay here, in the Theatre? Maybe even take your place? Would you like that, dear Mark?
6192355001437604 It's all over anyway. This choice is meaningless.
6192355001437605 But what does that mean for me…?
6192355001438851 You've always been one…
6192355001438852 Did you know that the north wind is silver, the east wind is musky, the dawn wind is white, and the west wind is violet?
6192355001438853 Weird colors… It's hard to tell white from silver. What's the difference?
6192355001438854 Musky? Is that a color, too?
6192355001438855 Of course not. It's a smell. And a taste, too.
6192355001438856 So why do most winds have colors, but this one has a smell? It's an odd classification.
6192355001438857 But it's more interesting this way. If the winds were red, blue, yellow, and green, they'd be very bland, don't you think?
6192355001438858 I guess you're right.
6192355001438859 What about red, blue, white, and black?
6192355001438860 I've seen that somewhere before.
6192355001438861 I guess.
6192355001438862 Why did you tell me this?
6192355001438863 Our Mistresses used to be unbearably straightforward. Black and White. Dark and Light. Evil and Good. Wild and Warm… Too simple.\nIt'll be more compelling now.
6192355001438864 Well… I'm glad the dead will have their own Mistress. For personal reasons.
6192355001438865 You're not the only one. This town has more dead than living, now.
6192355001438866 You're right… It's easier to count the living. The rest are dead.
6192355001438867 Just take care of yourself, all right?
6192355001438868 I hope you take good care of them.
6192355001438869 There are thousands of them, and you're just one girl. Well, not just any girl… a Mistress.
6192355001438870 Beshe, beshe… And who will you be?
6192355001438871 Well, I was just looking for someone to help me. You're the one everyone will listen to, after all.
6192355001438872 Not a Mistress, I'm afraid.
6192355001438873 Be khara, you are a good man. You've got funny ears, but that's all right. That'll do. And I'll be the Mistress of Bulls.
6192355001438874 What about the Kin, though?
6192355001438875 You mean… these new ones?
6192355001438876 Them, too. But they will go, and ours will stay.
6192355001438877 Leave bulls to butchers and odonghe. It's their job.
6192355001438878 Yamar berkhe basaghan bai!
6192355001438879 That'll do, huh? Thanks, kiddo! Glad I meet your high standards.
6192355001438880 The Kin <i>are</i> the bulls.
6192355001438881 There are people in it, too.
6192355001438882 Nuh uh. More bulls than people now. Much less human than before. It's so awesome now! Come and see for yourself. Will you come?
6192355001438883 Oh, yeah. I will have to now, some day.
6192355001438884 That was… to be expected. And appropriate…
6192355001438885 Be khara, you'll make a great Mistress. Bayartay, kiddo.
6192355001438886 A good one.
6192355001438887 I meant, the Mistress of what? Mistresses don't exist in isolation. They always have… domains.
6192355001438888 Mother was a sole Mistress.
6192355001438889 Yeah, and look how that turned out.
6192355001438890 And it drove her mad.
6192355001438891 It's not surprising.
6192355001438892 Can you at least tell me now—who <i>are</i> you?
6192355001438893 It's all so very sad, yes. But that's only because she tried to take Nina's place. That corrupted her soul and let darkness into her heart. It's because she didn't find her own path first. And I have.
6192355001438894 But… But… Just… Please tell me. Are you even human?
6192355001438895 I am.
6192355001438896 What kind of human are you?
6192355001438897 You'd better be. I'm counting on you.
6192355001438898 Are you really a saint?
6192355001438899 I've been dead certain you're the plague.
6192355001438900 It wasn't me. Don't <i>glare</i> at me like that.
6192355001438901 Fine. I believe you.
6192355001438902 Nope. Still not convinced.
6192355001438903 I don't know if I'm good or evil. Stupid words, anyway… But I'm trying to be gentle to others and hard on myself. I know how to sympathize and not judge. I try to love whoever I touch. That's the only answer I have.
6192355001438904 Well… that's what I wanted to hear.
6192355001438905 You don't seem too excited.
6192355001438906 You don't seem like too kind a person, girl saint.
6192355001438907 I hope things work out for you.
6192355001438908 You're still bizarre. But I guess we'll see.
6192355001438909 We've all been in hell these last few days. And still are, if you didn't notice.
6192355001438910 Are you saying we've died and don't know it? An old idea… and boring.
6192355001438911 Maybe.
6192355001438912 Bullshit. We're alive. I'm alive. I know that.
6192355001438915 Yes.
6192355001438916 Wrong. I've been there.
6192355001438917 There's a cruel glint in your eye… It's fitting that you're drawn here, to Olonngo, the Ford. You belong here.
6192355001438918 It's just a throat.
6192355001438919 You're free to stay in hell if you want. To be honest, I always felt like that's exactly where you crawled out from.
6192355001438920 It may not.
6192355001438921 Try jumping down there yourself. Although…no. Bad idea.
6192355001438922 You'll carry your own hell within you. Let it gnaw on you. That's what you deserve.
6192355001438923 I don't.
6192355001438924 We will not fraternize. There will be no closure.
6192355001438925 Shi yuunde yereebshe? Why have you come, then? This is my place. The place where beasts come to suffer and die. The place for me. Leave me here… Kindred.
6192355001438926 I am leaving you here, Foreman of the Abattoir.
6192355001438927 If you're too weak to carry your blame, kill yourself.
6192355001438928 I'm not weak.
6192355001438929 Then live and endure. Perhaps something will change after years pass.
6192355001438930 You are cruel.
6192355001438931 I can hardly stand looking at you, murderer of my father.
6192355001438932 I've nothing more to say.
6192355001438933 You are. A coward twice over.
6192355001438934 Baarhani, baarhani…
6192355001438935 I wanted less. I never expected… this.
6192355001438936 Neither did I…
6192355001438937 Ene shi yuun khun geeshebshe! Look at me, essegher! How I love you! How I admire you! \nYou are a true emshen, a true knower of the Lines. You chose the path of love. The path of pity. You took pity on us, the weak, the dying, the doomed…
6192355001438938 C'mon. No need to embellish, Sahba.
6192355001438939 Unente. I did.
6192355001438940 From their graves, things that had no place in this new world looked at you. Weak, dying, depleted things. Yet you saw life in them! Your gaze revived the unliving. You poured our blood back, returned us our lives, refused to let us be buried.\nGaze at me, emshen!
6192355001438941 I am.
6192355001438942 Really, I mean it… There's no need for this.
6192355001438943 You came into your father's inheritance, emshen. Following the Lines, drawing the Lines, you wove the Town back into its proper shape, and never betrayed your people.\nWe stared at you mutely. Said our goodbyes. Resigned ourselves to fate. Yet, you never abandoned the weak. Never abandoned us.
6192355001438944 Enough, Sahba Usp'tae. Stop it. Temper your rapture.
6192355001438945 I just… wanted to preserve a sliver of the miraculous in this world.
6192355001438946 Oshysh daa, go. I will always watch over you. From beneath Earth's skin, I will watch over you. Wherever I can reach, I will protect you. \nLike Mother Boddho… I shall caress your step.
6192355001438947 Come now…
6192355001438948 See you again, someday.
6192355001438949 Yes, I'm going. Goodbye, Sahba.
6192355001438950 I'd like to think that. But the sand pest will return, and will destroy those connections again.
6192355001439251 You're always so untimely… with all due respect, doctor.
6192355001439252 But we do have common ground.
6192355001439253 I'm sorry about your Tower, Caspar.
6192355001439255 I had utmost respect for your father, Master Burakh. We weren't friends, and neither will I be your friend. But respect is possible. It's up to us.
6192355001439256 What do you plan to do now?
6192355001439259 No. I didn't talk to you as much as I should have.
6192355001439261 Capella plans, not me. We'll do everything together from now on. Ask her.
6192355001439262 Tough.
6192355001439263 Not what I dreamt of doing.
6192355001439264 I'm sorry, kid. I really am.
6192355001439265 I guess you'll have to find a new venture, then. But you Kains appreciate self-development, don't you?
6192355001439266 So she's in charge? Somehow, I'm not surprised.
6192355001439267 Өөriy kheleer yar, basaghan.
6192355001439268 You are, but in the wrong company. You're playing with fire.
6192355001439269 What? I don't know <i>that</i> many words yet.
6192355001439270 So you want to be an Herb Bride?
6192355001439271 Shi yuunde ereebshe? Go home.
6192355001439351 People pass on… but things remain. Lots to do.
6192355001439352 Makes sense.
6192355001439353 People are different, and all hoarders, too. One needs a keen eye to tell the things they need from the things they don't. So people get attached to junk that should have been discarded in the first place.
6192355001439354 Like life. Was that what you meant?
6192355001439357 Whenever it's used, it's for a short stay. Whoever buys it, gives it away. Whoever needs it, doesn't yet know. Faced with it, you'll never say no.
6192355001439358 That's too simple.
6192355001439359 It's a coffin. The Army is in town, haven't you seen? So we'll now need twice as many coffins.
6192355001439360 You're not a coffin maker, though, even though you ride one.
6192355001439361 Eh… a couple of rags and boots, that's all those troops are good for. They drop like flies, with no artistry. To hell with them. Another riddle?
6192355001439362 Go ahead.
6192355001439363 Made from cow leather. Rather old. Passed on for three or four generations… before it got to me. Worn down, with a notched buckle. So many additional holes made in it…
6192355001439364 Not a particular rarity.
6192355001439365 So many children set straight with this belt. Parental authority is unbroken… They have a special way of educating kids. Cruel, but efficient, don't you think?
6192355001439366 We all had to bear it when we were kids.
6192355001439367 Poison.
6192355001439368 A coffin.
6192355001439369 Maybe. Still, the answer…?
6192355001439370 Poison.
6192355001439371 A coffin.
6192355001439372 I give up.
6192355001439373 I don't know.
6192355001439374 Father never hit me.
6192355001439375 Here, look at this crack. It wasn't his fault—it was the cat—but the parental response was to teach a lesson. He could've tricked them, sure, but the parent would have got him by the collar, anyway.\nThat face… so distant, so indignant. I love such faces. They're funny.
6192355001439376 You truly are a master of your work, rag-and-bone man.
6192355001439377 Guess the owner was starving.
6192355001439379 A belt, huh… I used to have one like it.
6192355001439380 Gee, I wonder! Look how nice and peaceful it is around!
6192355001439385 No one ever gives anything away voluntarily, that much is true.
6192355001439386 No. I'm tired of riddles.
6192355001439387 One was enough.
6192355001439388 Whoever likes it, can't take it away. Whatever you do, it's forever to stay. What is it?
6192355001439389 Time.
6192355001439390 Opinion.
6192355001439391 Wrong. This one has no correct answer. Anything can be taken away.
6192355001439392 Really…
6192355001439393 You're right.
6192355001439394 Word.
6192355001439395 Right.
6192355001439396 I give up…
6192355001439397 This one has no correct answer, anyway. Anything can be taken away.
6192355001439398 Really…
6192355001439399 What kind of a riddle doesn't have an answer?!
6192355001439751 Your son will come then. Wrap it all up after you.
6192355001439752 I suppose.
6192355001439753 …I'll have a son?
6192355001439754 You already do. And you'll have more. And a daughter. Enough heirs to knit back whatever you unravel in your old age.
6192355001439755 Sounds good…
6192355001439756 Is that so? I didn't know.
6192355001439757 I don't want a fate like Father's. I don't.
6192355001439758 I thought you were dead.
6192355001439759 From the Earth I came, to the Earth I return. Am I dead? All things live, now.
6192355001439760 Intense.
6192355001439761 Why do you call me that, Sahba? You're not my mother.
6192355001439762 Bi oylgono ugyb… I don't understand.
6192355001439763 Before? No… no. The past is in the past… Buried.\nYet she lives… She's buried, but hasn't passed away. I'll follow her legacy. Coming here every day… Listening to her advice…
6192355001439764 Where will you start?
6192355001439765 Huh. I expected to see you broken, boös.
6192355001439766 Me? Broken? No one has ever seen that… and no one ever will. Yes, no better time for hard work… than now. Time to get dirty again… No one's better suited for that… than me. No one.
6192355001439767 Where will you start?
6192355001439768 I'll start with myself, my boy… with myself. My seventh decade is just around the corner… Now is the time.
6192355001439769 Fair enough.
6192355001439770 The Bull Enterprise is dead.
6192355001439771 Good luck, boös Vlad.
6192355001439772 It is sick, my boy… merely sick. It will get better. You are a healer of humans, but I… I'm used to this patient. As one doctor to another… trust me. It'll live.
6192355001439773 We'll see.
6192355001439774 I hope it changes.
6192355001439775 Expecting to live long, I see… boös.
6192355001439776 Put the bottle down, Peter. You've had enough.
6192355001439777 You really don't. She's asleep.
6192355001439778 You've had enough, pal. And miracles don't exist. You don't see that? They're incompatible with life.
6192355001439779 No.
6192355001439780 Then why the fuck are you gawking at me like there's anything for us to talk about?
6192355001439781 Easy there, architect.
6192355001439782 Burakh. Just tell me one thing. Look me in the eye and say it. Could you have protected him? Could you have… saved him?
6192355001439783 …Yes. I could have.
6192355001439784 I'm not gawking. I'm just looking.
6192355001439785 Listen, brother…
6192355001439786 What did you say? "Brother"? Who the fuck gave you the right to call me brother?
6192355001439787 Calm down!
6192355001439788 Shush… I misspoke.
6192355001439789 No, I couldn't have.
6192355001439790 My fucking condolences! Happy now?
6192355001439791 You're clearly not happy to see me.
6192355001439792 I wanted to… to apologize. For Peter.
6192355001439793 I'll find the fuckers. I'll spend the rest of my days searching. I'll tear that general's throat out with my bare hands… I'll get the officers who gave the order, and the ones who stood by and watched, and the soldiers who manned the cannon, the ones who aimed it.
6192355001439794 What for?
6192355001439795 What for?! For the Tower. Have you ever lost a child?
6192355001439796 No.
6192355001439797 …I'm not gonna answer that question.
6192355001439798 You have no idea, obviously. I can tell.\nThirty-two people will pay for it with their lives. I've counted. Military fuckers… I'll follow them first thing tomorrow.
6192355001439799 Andrey, listen… Leave those thirty-two people alone. It… it was me. I did it.
6192355001439800 I don't.
6192355001439801 You?
6192355001439802 Me.
6192355001439803 Good luck with that.
6192355001439804 No. It was the cannon. So melt it down and leave people alone.
6192355001439805 Emshen.
6192355001439806 Oynon.
6192355001439807 Erdem.
6192355001439808 Did I say it right? "Emshen"?
6192355001439809 Not exactly. You need to swallow the vowels, like you can't open your mouth… Oh, forget it.
6192355001439810 Bachelor.
6192355001439811 You did.
6192355001439812 Well… this is it, I guess.
6192355001439813 This is it, erdem.
6192355001439814 Just call me by name. We don't want you to break your jaw.
6192355001439815 This pursuit of immortality will cost me my life. I doubt the Powers That Be in the Capital ever cared whether or not I could defeat death. They just threw the heretic into the fire, hoping he'd never return. Excuse the pathos.
6192355001439816 Cost you your life? Come now.
6192355001439817 It's just the beginning, oynon.
6192355001439818 Did someone send you here? I thought you came on your own accord.
6192355001439819 Yeah… You're right, I'm confused. I haven't been so drunk since my student years. Then again, it's hard to knock a doctor off their feet. I can still think, just… not straight.
6192355001439820 So… Cheers, I guess?
6192355001439821 …
6192355001439822 There is no death.
6192355001439823 Stay here. A new tower will grow, just you wait. I say this as… a friend.
6192355001439824 I'd rather you calculated me. You're good at… calculations.
6192355001439825 An ass-what? You know me, Yulia. Artemy no like big words.
6192355001439826 I'll think about it. Perhaps I'll go.
6192355001439846 Me, hate? I adore children. Even professionally, sawbones! I'm a circus performer. I've handled more children than a midwife.
6192355001439847 Wait, you're from the Caravan. The Caravan! The wandering, children-kidnapping circus!
6192355001439848 You? Like children? They frighten you nearly to tears!
6192355001440071 So, medenegshe, here's another law for you.\nNever hold a grudge, for grudges are bad for health and sneak behind. Be khara, whoever carries a grudge, shall slip on it and break their neck. So speaks Suok; she'll see to it at night. Tiimel daa, let it be so.
6192355001440072 Fair enough.
6192355001440073 Medenegshe, heed our law.\nNever deceive or betray the small ones and the ones that trust you. It is not only Suok's nocturnal law; Mother Boddho would turn away from you, too. No harming the small ones, tiimel daa. Let it be so.
6192355001440074 Those are some good laws, kid…
6192355001440075 Medenegshe, now for the most important law. The law of candy, sweets, and those soft white thingies they sell in shops. They are to be abundant. No one has the right to forbid eating them.\nMother Boddho… Somehow she will not see to this law. So I'll have to do it myself. Tiimel daa… Oh, I wonder what I should invent next?
6192355001440076 I think that's enough law for one day. You've done a great job, kid.
6192355001440077 Why are you here? She yuunded ereebshe? Did you come to listen to our not-so-highness?
6192355001440078 I just… wanted to take a look at you.
6192355001440079 Well done! Spoken like a true Mother Superior! Tiimel daa.
6192355001440080 Hey, are you all right up there, dyy basaghan? Are your feet not cold?
6192355001440081 Nope! Ene shi yuun khun gheeshebshe. Please don't interrupt!
6192355001440082 I just…
6192355001440083 I humbly obey, Mother Superior.
6192355001440084 Yamar berkhe basaghan dai!
6192355001440085 Tiimel daa.
6192355001440086 You're a harsh ruler…
6192355001440087 How am I harsh? Those aren't even my words, baygalday!
6192355001440088 All right, go on.
6192355001440089 Hara bosooli, it didn't take you long to fit into your new role…
6192355001440114 You're a cruel man, Kindred. Should have killed me.
6192355001440115 I have forgiven you. I mean it. <i>He</i> would, too.
6192355001440116 You'll carry your own hell within you. Let it gnaw on you. That's what you deserve.
6192355001440117 If you're too weak to carry your blame, kill yourself.
6192355001440118 I don't.
6192355001440119 We will not fraternize. There will be no closure.
6192355001440120 You are triumphant now, Kindred. Yet time will pass… and you will find yourself upturned. What was once atop the wheel, will find itself dragged down. You'll see. Tiimel dee.
6192355001440121 I'm leaving you here, Foreman of the Abattoir.
6192355001440122 Baarhani, baarhani…
6192355001440123 I'm not weak.
6192355001440124 Then live and endure. Perhaps something will change after years pass.
6192355001440125 You are. A coward twice over.
6192355001440126 You are cruel.
6192355001440127 I can hardly stand looking at you, murderer of my father.
6192355001440128 I've nothing more to say.
6192355001440129 Shi yuunde yereebshe? Why have you come, then?
6192355001440130 Not after you.
6192355001440131 This is my town, akhar. I go where I please.
6192355001440132 See this stone horn, Kindred? Know you what it is?
6192355001440133 No.
6192355001440134 Olonngo used to be a temple. This town was but steppe roads, with steppe gates as its bridges. Olonngo used to be the bull's head. We had no word for "town," then.\nNow a town has grown on our back. Pressed Olonngo down. We used to be a head, and now we are…
6192355001440135 Why are you telling me this?
6192355001440136 It's true.
6192355001440137 I do.
6192355001440138 I'm not triumphant. Not at all.
6192355001440139 What are you doing here, chief?
6192355001440140 I just came to listen. Fiery girl, isn't she? When she's a bit older, I'll definitely lure her into our gang.
6192355001440141 Like hell you will.
6192355001440142 She's out of your league, boy. Got a whole herd of Halves, that one.
6192355001440143 …What's my Half like?
6192355001440144 It's huge.
6192355001440145 So you're taking me into your gang, huh?
6192355001440146 Holy… Thanks, kid. Now, give me a minute, I need to get all this laughter out of my system.
6192355001440147 Fine. I'm a patient man.
6192355001440148 In the end, it didn't work out your way. I knew it would hurt you, and I am sorry.
6192355001440149 Don't say that…
6192355001440150 I didn't know what I was doing!
6192355001440151 Why have you come?
6192355001440152 People often visit Mistresses. And here…
6192355001440153 I like this place. It's soothing.
6192355001442982 See? All the Mistresses are here.
6192355001442983 Isn't it a bit too crowded?
6192355001442984 It's perfect.
6192355001442985 Why are you here?
6192355001442986 So you plan to become a Mistress yourself?
6192355001442987 I guess… Think I'll fail?
6192355001442988 What are you good at?
6192355001442989 Aren't you a bit young to be Mistresses?
6192355001442990 Divination. I told your fortune, didn't I? That you'd spill rivers of blood? And you did… Drowned the whole square in it. Am I wrong?
6192355001442991 You're right.
6192355001442992 It's… it's different.
6192355001442993 No it isn't.
6192355001442994 I never wanted to…
6192355001442995 Just… getting to know each other. Each came here seemingly spontaneously, each for her own reasons, spurred by her own thoughts… But in truth, we're getting to know each other.
6192355001442996 That's some complex diplomacy, girls.
6192355001442997 We aren't <i>girls.</i> We're Mistresses. In a couple years, you'll see.
6192355001442998 But <i>what</i> will I see?
6192355001442999 Even two were too many.
6192355001443000 That's not for you to judge.
6192355001443001 Why not?
6192355001443002 So what are you doing here? Partitioning out domains?
6192355001443003 All right. Play Mistresses. Can't see any harm in this game.
6192355001443004 Enough miracles. Enough for a lifetime.
6192355001443005 You did.
6192355001443006 No.
6192355001443007 What are you doing here?
6192355001443008 I can see the two of you are sharing a moment. I will be on my way.
6192355001443009 It's up to you to be worthy of respect.
6192355001443651 What if I refuse to bring any of the Olgimskys to the Kin?
6192355001445151 Divination. I saw your… rivers of blood too. And you spilled them. Drowned the whole square. So I was right, wasn't I?
6192355001445152 Divination's easy in hindsight.
6192355001445153 It's… it's different.
6192355001446551 
6192355001446552 
6192355001446553 
6192355001446554 
6192355001446555 
6192355001446556 
6192355001446557 
6192355001446558 
6192355001446559 
6192355001446560 
6192355001446561 
6192355001446562 
6192355001446868 What do you mean?
6192355001446869 Because they're dangerous. They'll eat you.
6192355001446870 What do you mean… eat me? Why? When?
6192355001446871 As soon as you finish that charming melody.
6192355001446872 During your first dance.
6192355001446873 Why…? Because that's the steppe way. Go home, girl. Don't play with fire.
6192355001446874 Yeah… That's where I live.
6192355001446875 And why the hell are you here?
6192355001446876 You know, I've always felt torn… Drawn to the steppe, to the herbs, to dreams of dancing with the Brides… But also to the Cathedral. I'm not sure why—I guess it's my fate?\nSo I stayed home, neither here nor there… and <i>now</i> look! It's all come together!
6192355001446877 Not sure it's to your benefit.
6192355001446878 Yamar berkhe basaghan bai!
6192355001446879 What…?
6192355001446880 It means "Attagirl!" You're walking a dangerous line here.
6192355001446881 So you want to be an Herb Bride?
6192355001446882 Come over here.
6192355001446883 Who are you?
6192355001446884 You're dressed strangely.
6192355001446885 I live in the Stillwater.
6192355001446886 Oh!
6192355001446887 So are you.
6192355001446888 I think I saw you before…
6192355001446889 They're discussing what they're planning to build next. And I'm listening. So interesting!
6192355001446890 So what are they saying?
6192355001446892 Haven't they built enough? The Town already strangles the Gorkhon.
6192355001446893 I guess.
6192355001446894 So what about that… grand construction project?
6192355001446895 What do you have here?
6192355001446896 I don't know, either. So interesting! Daniil was fascinated by it, too. He kept asking around, looking at documents…
6192355001446897 Should've spent more time working on the vaccine instead.
6192355001446898 You two were close, weren't you?
6192355001446899 I guess.
6192355001446900 Anyway. This town existed long before those Oneirotects.
6192355001446901 That's so strange… So many strong and resolute people have died, yet a daisy like you survives…
6192355001446902 More engineering metaphors…
6192355001446903 I meant an onager, of course, to be more precise. I just used the word "catapult" to make the idea easier to digest.
6192355001446904 So considerate of you, Judge.
6192355001446905 No. What is a "normal person," anyway? What is the "norm"? Think it over, dear Haruspex, lest you blurt out something really ignorant and find yourself in an awkward position.
6192355001446906 Yeah… It's unwise to get into arguments with you.
6192355001446907 Or other kinds of fights, young man.
6192355001446908 Why do you want to… propel humanity forward? And where? The coldness of space?
6192355001446909 Then I'll leave you to your thoughts.
6192355001446910 Of course. For I am the Judge.
6192355001446911 Father… He didn't do it on purpose.
6192355001446912 Your brother… He and my father…
6192355001446913 Of course he did.
6192355001446914 I mean, it was bound to happen one way or another.
6192355001446915 This plague would come back to haunt us anyway!
6192355001446916 Correct. And the great people who guarded our town against it before were withering and dying. There was no time to waste.
6192355001446917 I guess.
6192355001446918 Yes.
6192355001446919 What do you mean?
6192355001446920 They had a different daughter before.
6192355001446921 Forget it. Bad choice of words.
6192355001446922 And?
6192355001446923 It didn't end well. But perhaps it'll go better with you.
6192355001446924 Forget about it. I'm happy you've found each other.
6192355001446925 It'll take you a long time to count all the dead. Your hair will turn grey.
6192355001446926 So what?
6192355001446927 Nothing. So your parents are teaching you?
6192355001447051 I can't seem to get a good look at you… Wait. Yes. I remember. You're Isidor's son.\nBut I did not call for help.
6192355001447052 What are you doing here?
6192355001447056 I simply came here to see. A Mistress should know her town, don't you agree?\nThen people came, who doubted that I am me and wanted to be sure. Suspecting that I'm not a real Mistress seems quite popular these days.
6192355001447057 So they locked you in this house and nailed the door shut?
6192355001447058 What were they trying to find out?
6192355001447059 Trapping someone inside an infected building is practically murder.
6192355001447060 Do you know the ancient way to identify a witch? If she drowns, she's innocent. If she survives, she must be a witch—off to the stake with her.\nAnd our town's residents have taken to testing people with the plague. They call it "sandboxing." What charming folk.
6192355001447061 Has this been going on long?
6192355001447062 Come, I'll escort you out of here.
6192355001447063 Since the Middle Ages.
6192355001447064 Come with me.
6192355001447066 I'm not done here yet. Be on your way now. I'm waiting for someone and don't need you around for that conversation.
6192355001447067 Well, I've removed the boards. You're free to go.
6192355001447069 Who are you waiting for?
6192355001447070 That's what they thought. Do you imagine that those boards can measure up to the prison I've languished in for years? Hmph.
6192355001447071 This place is dangerous.
6192355001447072 What are you talking about?
6192355001447073 Do you imagine that those boards can measure up to the prison I've languished in for years? Hmph.\nGo, Burakh. Cure the ones who need it. I can deal with this house without your help.
6192355001447074 So you are a witch after all…
6192355001447075 The most horrible prisons are always internal.
6192355001447451 Aspity
6192355001448751 This is my final hour. Death stands at my door.
6192355001448752 I'm not his harbinger. Actually, I'm kind of the opposite.
6192355001448753 You reek of meat, man of heavy hands. And of blood. And misfortune…
6192355001448754 Yeah… People keep saying that.
6192355001448755 You're a steppe man, aren't you? You're Kin? Tell me how to walk the steppe right.
6192355001448756 Clearly I have nothing better to do than teach you steppe-walking.
6192355001448757 It's empty and silent. Soulless. A week ago, I had a dream. I was walking down its aisle… or rather, falling. I woke up and thought… Ah, it doesn't matter.\nAnyway, I'm curious about what exactly went wrong with Farkhard's plan, and if the Cathedral can be fixed. I'll ask around.
6192355001448758 Don't. It's fine as is.
6192355001448759 Your interest in local history is commendable.
6192355001449151 Honestly! Are you actually trying to console me?
6192355001449152 Sorry. I shouldn't have said that.
6192355001449153 Yes. There's a life ahead of us now.
6192355001449154 Relax. I can see she's just an ordinary human to you.
6192355001449155 Where did she go, Grief? Snap out of it for a second.
6192355001449156 And to you, she's what? A three-headed dragon?
6192355001449157 Perhaps she is.
6192355001449158 Whatever… Sooner or later, she'll leave, and you'll return to normal. Hopefully you won't become a monk. Where is she?
6192355001449159 Nah, she just sent them a portrait of herself. Of course she went on her own! Are you all right in the head, Cub?
6192355001449160 What orders did she send?
6192355001449161 Why do you care? If they actually shot the witch, we should bow down an' kiss their feet. But they didn't, and won't. She's not so simple.
6192355001449162 Perhaps I do care.
6192355001449163 I see… Do you have anything here to eat?
6192355001449164 An idiot, are you? I'm feastin' on my former sins. I'm far from starvation.
6192355001449165 You're the idiot.
6192355001449166 Great. Well, see you.
6192355001449167 I guess.
6192355001449168 You freak…
6192355001449169 I'm listening.
6192355001449170 I'm a surgeon. Artemy Burakh.
6192355001449353 Same as usual, I think…
6192355001449354 So I'm taking her?
6192355001449355 Yes. It's the right thing to do.
6192355001449356 Still, no.
6192355001449751 Then who was wailing?
6192355001449752 I don't know. Someone in a different room, maybe.
6192355001449753 You're alone in this house, Katerina.
6192355001450951 
6192355001451051 Huh. I can't smell it anymore, myself. Got used to it, I guess.
6192355001451060 I'm a doctor. Here to check up on you.
6192355001451451 I'm a doctor who's making a cure for this plague.
6192355001451452 Burakh, doctor. At your service.
6192355001451453 Ah, I remember now. You were in the report. What means are currently at our disposal to combat the outbreak? Briefly, please.
6192355001451454 Briefly? None.
6192355001451455 There are four doctors in town. Dankovsky, a theorist; a girl who performs miracles; Rubin, a forensic specialist; and me, a surgeon. That's all.
6192355001451456 I have a recipe for a serum, but it's useless.
6192355001451457 Anything to add?
6192355001451458 No.
6192355001451459 What kind of blood does it require?
6192355001451460 Blood of an unknown creature, most likely an animal.
6192355001451461 Of an unknown creature. But it's warm and living, which means the creature is living, too—and it's close!
6192355001451462 What kind of creature? A brontosaurus? A phoenix? Or, hmm, what else… An angel of God?
6192355001451463 I don't know. I'm looking for it!
6192355001451464 I think it's a bull. A special kind of bull. Call it intuition…
6192355001451466 Can your cure be reproduced chemically?
6192355001451467 Not in these conditions.
6192355001451468 Ask Dankovsky.
6192355001451469 Listen, Burakh. Am I saying it right? "Burakh"?\nOur unit has no medical personnel. We were sent here <i>butt naked.</i> I'll figure out later if it was insanity, negligence, or a premeditated crime… but right now, we need you to give us everything you have. Do I make myself clear?
6192355001451470 Crystal clear.
6192355001451471 I have a recipe for a serum. Based on traditional medicine, so to speak.
6192355001451472 Go on.
6192355001451473 It requires blood of an… unknown nature.
6192355001451474 I don't know where to get the raw material for it.
6192355001451475 Blood of previously-infected survivors?
6192355001451476 It leaves no survivors.
6192355001451477 Don't give me those tall tales… what was it… Burakh? Artemy Burakh, correct?
6192355001451478 Correct.
6192355001451481 How can we find the source of this blood?
6192355001451482 All blood seeps from Olonngo.
6192355001451483 I guess the Inquisitor could solve this problem.
6192355001451484 Inquisitors only ever solve their own problems, never anyone else's. Whatever they tell you, their real agendas are inscrutable. Don't let them fool you. They're just parasites, making others do their dirty work. The only well-being they care about is their own.\nAny more ideas?
6192355001451485 I have a sample.
6192355001451486 I'm a doctor, not an investigator.
6192355001451487 Just call me by my last name.
6192355001451488 One beats the bush, and <i>seven others</i> catch the bird…
6192355001451491 You no longer work in the hospital. Your only job is to find the raw material for the serum, in sufficient quantities to protect the Town. I don't need samples, or some proof-of-concept—I need a train car <i>full</i> of your cure.\nIf we don't find it in two days, I will have to bombard the Town. Those are my orders. Do I make myself clear?
6192355001451492 What?
6192355001451493 You're a general. Who could order… ah, never mind.
6192355001451494 Let them burn in hell! But orders are orders. We're military, Burakh. We don't debate orders.\nThe extreme lethality and unclear origin of your disease demands the full destruction of your town as a transport junction and settlement. We must create an exclusion zone. Do I make myself clear?
6192355001451495 Yes. I have a question…
6192355001451496 No.
6192355001451497 Dismissed.\nYou're under an obligation to report to the headquarters immediately if summoned, and to carry out any order I give you. The Army commissions you. For now, your goal is to find the missing serum component—in significant quantities.\nThat's it. You're free to go.
6192355001451498 I don't feel free…
6192355001451499 It was nice meeting the jewel of our military.
6192355001451500 If you ask so nicely… General Ashes.
6192355001451501 Even if you have found a source of raw material for your serum, it's too late now. We'll execute the order and leave for the front. That's it.
6192355001451502 So there will be a bombardment?
6192355001451503 So this is what you are like, General Ashes.
6192355001451504 Yes.
6192355001451505 But you'll have to fire anyway, right?
6192355001451506 If the target is designated, I'll have to.
6192355001451507 So there is nothing to discuss here.
6192355001451508 But you will fire in either case?
6192355001451509 How can she promise that?
6192355001451510 She can. I trust her. Are you here on business, or what?
6192355001451511 I am.
6192355001451512 What has she done to you? I can't believe my ears…
6192355001451513 Do you seriously believe I intend to discuss this with you? State your business and be done with it.
6192355001451514 I am here on the Inquisitor's behalf…
6192355001451515 In that case, I have something for you…
6192355001451516 The Inquisitor has done the calculations.
6192355001451517 And, Burakh? Wait a second.
6192355001451518 Waiting.
6192355001451519 It's all decided. What else is there to talk about?
6192355001451520 Come with us. We need an experienced doctor.
6192355001451521 Take Dankovsky.
6192355001451522 I thought about it. Thank you. I'll catch up with you after I finish my business here.
6192355001451523 Take Rubin. That's his cup of tea. He's a natural-born soldier.
6192355001451524 No.
6192355001451525 Are you and General Block…
6192355001451526 No.
6192355001451527 Then what? Are you trying to convert him?
6192355001451528 We <i>were</i> talking about the war. Criminal orders. History. Honor. Duty. Truth.\nNow we're talking about words. Will you <i>please</i> leave us alone?
6192355001451529 Are you… really a saint?
6192355001451530 Just… don't ever do that to me.
6192355001451531 I didn't know you knew those words.
6192355001451532 What do you know about the war? What can you tell him?
6192355001451533 Please. You're disturbing us.
6192355001451534 Fine. I guess I'll just count my blessings…
6192355001451535 Madness…
6192355001451671 …How the hell did we get into this? We've lost three-quarters of our troops in two days—General Ashes' troops!\nThere were five times fewer of us at the Fords, can you believe that? And just eleven killed in action. One hundred and eighteen wounded. Ashes has always protected his people. But here… all hell broke loose under us. Three quarters! That's six hundred people pushing daisies.
6192355001451672 Where's Ashes?
6192355001451673 It's not enough that the sand pest mows you down? You have to shoot each other, too?
6192355001451701 I'm healthy.
6192355001451702 Show me your hands.
6192355001451703 Take a look. I'm healthy.
6192355001451704 Calm down, officer. I'm a doctor too.
6192355001451705 Three steps back. Rear—march!
6192355001451706 Where's Block? I'm on an errand.
6192355001451707 …There a stone, looks like a bird's beak. That's where the fighting's moved to. Now, civilian! Three steps back—and—<i>march!</i>
6192355001451708 It's called Crowstone. And calm down, okay? Everything's gonna be fine.
6192355001451709 I'm the doctor. What do you want?
6192355001451710 A courier must have come here with papers for General Block…
6192355001451711 I want Block.
6192355001451712 I'm telling you, I'm healthy! I'm leaving anyway. Don't get jumpy…
6192355001451713 Another Burakh… Funny meatsacks, you. So many Burakhs around, these days.
6192355001451714 I am the only Burakh around.
6192355001451715 And who are <i>you?</i> Is the general here?
6192355001451716 I'm the general. General Asskicker, all right? You hear what I asked?
6192355001451717 I did.
6192355001451718 And?
6192355001451719 Burakh. Surgeon.
6192355001451720 I'm a doctor.
6192355001451721 Unfriendly, aren't you?
6192355001451722 Tired of living, boy?
6192355001451723 I'm not a boy. I'm a man.
6192355001451724 I'm Doctor Burakh.
6192355001451725 Hey, Stout, Splinter! Scrag the boy. No torture, just scrag 'em.
6192355001451726 Stop it! I'm a doctor.
6192355001451727 A doctor, huh?
6192355001451728 Burakh. Surgeon. Heard of me?
6192355001451729 So you're one of those gangs that roam around at night? Well, no need to waste words on you, then.
6192355001451730 Yeah. I'm here to fix your skulls, you assholes!
6192355001451731 Look over there, at the stage. See? That's a Burakh, too. He was running after the general with some papers, but his foot slipped. Now he's preparing for an operation. Gathering his thoughts.\nHere are my conditions. One of us got a bit punctured. A lovely soul, really—very dear to me. So whoever fixes him is Burakh in my book.
6192355001451732 Explain.
6192355001451733 Aren't you an educated man? Do I need to make myself even <i>more</i> clear?
6192355001451734 Yes.
6192355001451735 You'll extract the bullet. Don't worry about your gear, we got everything covered—leftovers from your predecessor. Then you'll patch the hole, he's got enough of 'em. Well, either you do it, or that clown will.\nIf our pal survives, you're free to drag your sorry asses to that general of yours. If he doesn't, you're both dog food. Food for dogs, Burakh.
6192355001451736 So he claimed to be Burakh?
6192355001451737 I guess he really wanted to survive. And since he did, now he owes us.
6192355001451738 Where's the wounded?
6192355001451739 I'm Burakh. I'll fix your pal.
6192355001451740 …Just like Grief's errand on the first day. Oh, Grief, and here I thought <i>you</i> were the bad guy.
6192355001451744 What?
6192355001451745 What did you say?
6192355001451746 …I'm just surprised.
6192355001451747 I said what I said. Stop trying to provoke me.
6192355001451748 You stupid? Is that what you're getting at?
6192355001451749 What do you want from me?
6192355001451750 Your attitude is clear. Say what you want.
6192355001451751 Oh, I'll <i>show</i> you the real Burakh, all right.
6192355001451752 No, I got it already. You just really want to have your teeth smashed in.
6192355001451781 Boil water. Lots of it.
6192355001451782 Get me all the bandages you can. Rip up all the cloth you can find to make more.
6192355001451783 Get me the longest set of tweezers from the bag.
6192355001451784 [He was shot in the stomach. That's bad news, he is almost a goner. The wounded is wearing a sweater and several shirts at once. Guess he was hoping the layers of cloth will protect him from sand pest.]
6192355001451785 [Wash my hands]
6192355001451786 [Sterilize my tools]
6192355001451787 [Get my hands on some alcohol, preferably not the drinking kind]
6192355001451788 [Cut off the clothing, it obstructs the wound]
6192355001451789 [The wound doesn't look good at all. A ricocheting rifle round, by the looks of it. But I feel like he has a chance.]
6192355001451790 [Wash the wound with water]
6192355001451791 [Clean the wound with alcohol]
6192355001451792 [Strap his torso with cloth, both above and below the wound]
6192355001451793 [Strap his torso below the wound]
6192355001451794 [Strap his ribs with cloth]
6192355001451795 [The patient's breath gets hoarse, he is gurgling and wheezing.]
6192355001451796 [Search the wound with tweezers. Gently now...]
6192355001451797 [Make a few incisions at the edge of the wound]
6192355001451798 [Calm the patient down. With my left hand, firmly immobilize his head]
6192355001451799 [It looks like the wound is less dangerous than it first seemed. The bullet didn't go in deep enough to do major damage. However, the wound is contaminated with pieces of dirty cloth.]
6192355001451800 [Time to drain the wound... With some cleaner cloth]
6192355001451801 [Shouldn't have done that! He is wheezing and struggling even harder. There is still a chance]
6192355001451802 Okay, buddy, calm down. We can get through this.
6192355001451803 Someone knock him out already! He's flailing around!
6192355001451804 [Gently pull the wound wider apart]
6192355001451805 [Quickly drain the blood with clumped bandages, it's impossible to see!]
6192355001451806 [Something hard inside.]
6192355001451807 [Something small. A bone fragment...? I don't think so, not in the stomach!]
6192355001451808 [Pull it out, whatever it is]
6192355001451809 [No time for dawdling]
6192355001451810 [Metal. That's the bullet. Come here, little thing...]
6192355001451811 [Pull it out sharply!]
6192355001451812 [Touch it with my finger]
6192355001451813 [Pull it out steadily]
6192355001451814 Stop gawking and pin his legs, you useless fucks!
6192355001451815 [It's... It's done. Clean the wound again, then apply bandages. Easy stuff.]
6192355001451816 He'll live.
6192355001451817 He's a survivor, that one.
6192355001451818 If he lives, I'd like to talk to him when he feels a little better.
6192355001451855 
6192355001451856 
6192355001451857 You have no business in the steppe, town flower. What are you? A daisy? A forget-me-not?
6192355001451859 A daisy, I guess… You must be a bitterroot.
6192355001451863 Why?
6192355001451866 Who are you, anyway?
6192355001452351 It's the same everywhere.
6192355001452352 Say... did you by any chance call to me? I sensed this strange prickling. Like you needed me...
6192355001452353 That's what I thought. But now I'm not so sure…
6192355001452354 Tell me… Is there anything you want from me? I had this odd <i>prickling</i> in my heart…
6192355001452355 Yes! You have such a sensitive heart. It never lies to you. You can hear! You can truly hear!\nI mean—I didn't call you on purpose. I can feel the Town, and touch it. It sings. And you hear its song too. You understand, don't you? It's a pulse. You've sensed it… Tell me, what was it like?
6192355001452356 It did feel like a pulse.
6192355001452357 I felt like someone was staring at my back.
6192355001452358 Like I got blackthorn stuck to my foot.
6192355001452359 Like intuition. "I am expected—I need to come." That's it.
6192355001452360 Anyway… something horrible is about to happen. And I can't do anything myself, no one would listen… not yet. That's why I thought of you, I guess… You're the only one who can take this seriously.\nIt's about Grace. She's all worn out, coming apart at the seams. And no one sees it, not even Grace herself. If no one helps her get a grip, I'm afraid she'll…
6192355001452361 Die?
6192355001452362 It's healthy to doubt.
6192355001452363 Get sick?
6192355001452364 Lose her gift?
6192355001452365 I'm not sure. I'm not that good a seer yet. But I know that if she comes unraveled now, that would be it. No one would be able to piece her back together.\nCan you pay her a visit? Can you help?
6192355001452366 Like I have a choice. Coming apart at the seams… sewing the unraveled back together is my thing.
6192355001452367 If I have the time.
6192355001452368 I think I know what this is about. The cemetery is overcrowded. "The dead are coming."
6192355001452752 <i>The beige thread has snapped.</i>
6192355001452753 I have to admit, this is the last thing I expected. I'm dead weight to her. I expected respect, or maybe <i>loathing,</i> but… she takes me for a useless dreamer. Assigned me to take care of the Town's corpses, instead of any other thing I could be doing!\nNo matter. Someone needs to do this job, too. A doctor can't shy away from dirty work.
6192355001452754 "She"? You mean the Inquisitor?
6192355001452757 What's wrong with our corpses?
6192355001452758 This isn't the first time you've had to manage the Town's business, oynon. You're good at it.
6192355001452759 Yes.
6192355001452760 What does she want you to do?
6192355001452761 You do that. It's… tough for her in the cemetery.
6192355001452762 …I wonder if <i>you're</i> the threat looming over her, emshen. Don't be rash. Let me talk to her.
6192355001452763 So that's why you come apart at the seams. Too many dead to console?
6192355001452764 Too many. All of them so cold… You don't believe me, do you? Go and listen! Go listen to those huge graves—they dump people there by the dozen!
6192355001452765 All right, sweetie. Just stop crying.
6192355001452766 I see what the issue is.
6192355001452767 You really can talk.
6192355001452768 Has Grace given me the power to hear you, somehow?
6192355001452769 ALL—CALL—ALL—COLD\nICY—I—SEE—I\nLACKING\nCLAD—IN—COLD
6192355001452770 …Is Isidor Burakh among you?
6192355001452771 I see. You are definitely cramped.
6192355001452772 Cold can be driven away… by fire.
6192355001452773 CALL—ONE—CALL—ALL\nALL—ONE\nALONE
6192355001452774 I'm sorry I asked.
6192355001452775 None of you are alone over there… You're all pretty cramped.
6192355001452776 You need warmth.
6192355001452777 What kind of thing are you?
6192355001452778 Not the kind from your league. My own kind of thing. It's you who barged into my domain, not the other way around, so show some respect and kiss the hem.
6192355001452779 Like hell I will.
6192355001452780 Your domain? Curious. Tell me, are there many dead people underground?
6192355001452781 Tell me what you want, human, or begone.
6192355001452782 I need the dead to stop smothering one another underground.
6192355001452783 I think I'd prefer the latter. I don't like your tone. Or the smell. Rotting meat…
6192355001452784 Are the dead truly uncomfortable down there? Or does it only seem that way to the living?
6192355001452785 You'll know when you're dead.
6192355001452786 How do I stop their screaming?
6192355001452787 How are you going to arrange that?
6192355001452788 Safe and sound. So? I'm not a town hall clerk, awaiting your orders…
6192355001452789 Cremation would destroy them. You… maybe not. Go ahead, work your magic.
6192355001452790 Do it. For Grace's safety.
6192355001452791 Forget it. I can sense that your plans are vile.
6192355001452792 Then we must burn them. There's no other way. Or they'll smother you.
6192355001452793 No! No burning! Then they won't be able to talk to us! The last thread will tear. Hope itself will dissolve. They'll be gone forever—can't you see?
6192355001452794 But they're already dead. They can't feel anything.
6192355001452795 Something has to be sacrificed. Better them than you.
6192355001452796 Saved your life, girl. The dead were tearing you apart.
6192355001452797 You didn't save anything. You don't understand.
6192355001452798 You're more important than corpses. Without you, who would console the future dead?
6192355001452799 You'll understand one day.
6192355001452800 Did you hear them? Did you?
6192355001452801 Yes.
6192355001452802 I sensed them.
6192355001452803 Do you understand now?
6192355001452804 I don't. How was I able to do that? You're the only one that can.
6192355001452806 I do. They're… different. Unlike anything else in the world.
6192355001452807 I do. They're cold, smothered, and in pain.
6192355001452808 They're unique. Not like us. They forget the simple, and learn the inexplicable.\nThey have their own tongue… like your people, the Kin. Not everyone understands the Kin—but then they don't go and burn you, do they!
6192355001452809 …That's a hell of a comparison.
6192355001452810 Well… I put a piece of thread in your pocket. Single-use.
6192355001452811 The thread worked. I've heard them.
6192355001452812 No. One must not burn the living.
6192355001452813 I mean… don't kill the living. Or the dead.\nSo forget my complaining, all right? It was just momentary… It hurts, but that's fine. They hurt more. Just don't do anything bad to them…
6192355001452814 I won't. I understand now. We'll let everything stay as it was.
6192355001452815 I won't touch the dead. But I'm not so sure about you.
6192355001452816 Look, it's not my idea. It's the Bachelor, and the Town Hall people. But this place is not good for you.
6192355001452817 Inquisitor's Orders
6192355001452818 A paper ordering the demolition of the Polyhedron, signed by Aglaya Lilich and sealed with the inquisitorial symbol.
6192355001452819 «430 38210 1497163528 879 38210 48396290 68222471613769175 18 1052717902 29165845946 38210 49870611 887 38210 41686371 1330178 1669402190247802342 34697687 388 38210 2608426264616807 10 2249484262227 81324246808634 68674986722284 10 1377214 1136413993 671 38210 46230147 36326011271 1068 410 1361552531131669 20331 24400 771812596 22752948989 1398842409238 13801 24400 1000269304941 1078862356 1547593502 724009 1147926313669…»\n\nThe whole paper is just uneven groups of numbers.
6192355001452820 Time is up. My delay made the choice for me.
6192355001452822 The udurgh is the Living Earth. Ancient aurochs return from the depths of time.
6192355001453051 A behemoth bunkhouse for the Bull Enterprise workers.
6192355001453052 State inquisitor Aglaya Lilich works here… accompanied by Bad Grief, for some reason.
6192355001453053 Loyalist
6192355001453054 Here's something stiffer.
6192355001453055 Officer
6192355001453651 Don't, then. I'm a yargachin myself. I'll survive. Do what must be done, and do it fast.
6192355001453652 What must be done?
6192355001453653 Where are you going?
6192355001453654 Upstairs. To find Overseer Tycheek.
6192355001453655 Don't worry about me. I belong to the Kin. I'm at home here.
6192355001454651 The concrete tomb of my people… and its protective shell.
6192355001454851 
6192355001455551 Got a smoke, man?
6192355001455553 Be careful around those soldiers. They can kick your ass. Absolutely demolished one of us already, for no good reason.
6192355001455554 No reason at all?
6192355001455851 Here, roll it yourself.
6192355001455852 I don't smoke.
6192355001455951 
6192355001455952 
6192355001456151 She's like a magician… Asked four questions, wrote down three letters. I have no idea what it meant, but I'm scared.
6192355001456152 I guess she hasn't broken you completely yet.
6192355001456153 Was it rough?
6192355001456154 Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
6192355001456155 There aren't many good or bad people in the world. Most people are just people.
6192355001456161 How did she find out about the theft? Ugh… It wasn't even a <i>real</i> theft! And I'll never do it again!
6192355001456163 Don't.
6192355001456164 Did she summon your children, too?
6192355001456165 What <i>does</i> she do to you all…
6192355001457051 I'm not a pretty dancer, so stop gawking. If you've got business, say it.
6192355001457052 I'm not here for you. I dropped by to see your chemist, but he's not around. So I've got no one else to gawk at.
6192355001457053 Will there be a barrage? What do we do? The infection may pass, but this… So many cannons… Does this mean they're planning a strike?
6192355001457054 They won't fire if we make a cure.
6192355001457652 Well, he only wanted to have a look at his rifle. And help himself to his flask… Barely got out of there alive.
6192355001457653 Don't take chances with the military.
6192355001457951 Something's wrong at Anna's.
6192355001458451 Don't pester soldiers. You're asking for trouble.
6192355001459451 Bite your tongue, li'l bird. Off, preferably. I'm buying! Hahaha…
6192355001459452 So what happened to the chemist?
6192355001459454 I don't know. I'm not the one informing on people. You tell me what happened to the chemist! Only, I don't care.
6192355001459455 Did you just call me a snitch?
6192355001459456 Not selling it.
6192355001459459 Was the chemist arrested?
6192355001459460 His actions threatened us all! Don't you see?
6192355001459463 Oh, don't mind me. Want to know where he is? Ask the people that took him. I know nothing. And if I did, I wouldn't tell a mole. So off you go to your li'l hole. I'm busy.
6192355001459464 No. Asking those people is pointless.
6192355001459465 How do you know it was me?
6192355001459466 You're one sleazy person.
6192355001459554 You're taking your sweet time making that cure! But what about us? What do we do?
6192355001459555 Wait.
6192355001459556 Believe.
6192355001459557 Stay indoors and wash your hands.
6192355001459558 At least we get to choose now.
6192355001459559 Choose what?
6192355001459560 How to die. We had Plague and Famine before, but now there's War.
6192355001459561 Forget it. It was an unfunny joke.
6192355001460351 
6192355001460352 
6192355001460353 
6192355001460851 Stop being silly, akhar. Why do you ask when you cannot comprehend the answer? You know not how our world works. You cannot cut Bos Turokh open.\nThen again, it's not just you. One needs to see it with their very eyes… words fail to convey it.
6192355001460852 So what do we do?
6192355001460853 It's not that simple… I'll gather the people, open the entrance. But it takes time. We'll figure out how the blood streams from there.\nWho could have thought… the Ear bleeds. Shekhen bleeds… This is odd. Was there much blood here?
6192355001460854 Too little to cure everyone.
6192355001460855 I'd like to see it!
6192355001460856 Who are you calling "akhar"? Mind your place, odongh!
6192355001461721 What do you want, Kindred? Tell me. What drives you on this Earth?
6192355001461722 Honestly? I don't give a damn about this outbreak. I just want to know who killed my father—and get vengeance.
6192355001461723 I trust you, somehow… and I desperately need advice. Father left me a debt, an obligation. A list of people in danger. There were a bunch of kids… and one "udurgh." Do you know what it means?
6192355001461724 I have to take Father's place. But I still don't have any idea what it means exactly. Who <i>was</i> he? Who am I to become? What does it mean for me…?
6192355001461725 Nothing. I don't belong to this town. I'd leave if I could.
6192355001462055 The Kin are a beast of one heart and many heads… and that beast does not yet acknowledge your mastery. No one would take your questions seriously yet.
6192355001462056 Sahba would.
6192355001462057 Why not? They clearly treat me with respect.
6192355001462058 Depends on how I ask.
6192355001462059 No. You are an outsider to them.\nMaybe Tycheek would take you seriously… but I doubt even that. And the people… to them, you are no one, khayaala.
6192355001462060 I'll talk to Tycheek, then.
6192355001465051 The feeling that Capella wants to talk is gone. I guess I've done something without her help…
6192355001465351 Prompter
6192355001467051 Why are you here? I don't understand. They won't let you in, anyway. You know this, and yet you came.
6192355001467052 Why are <i>you</i> here? I thought you didn't like the Polyhedron.
6192355001467053 Ah, there you are. Time for our first rehearsal! \nThis is all very emotional, but don't get anxious. It's just a study, not a full play yet. So take your time and get into character.
6192355001467054 A rehearsal? What's going on?
6192355001467055 Don't worry about us. Not many children are here so far, but more are coming—everyone who's healthy.\nThe Rose will protect us from the plague.
6192355001467056 The Bridge Square is infected! And yet you cross it on foot…
6192355001467057 There's infection below. That's why we're standing here waiting. The signs appear quickly. That's what the Bachelor told me.\nThis staircase is the best isolation ward available. We'll spend the night here. The sick will descend. Whoever remains on the staircase by the morning will go inside.
6192355001467058 What if there's a bombardment? Have you seen the cannon they've brought in…?
6192355001467059 Let me through. I want to talk to the others.
6192355001467060 Don't. For whatever reason, they love you. Send you all the hellos in the world.\nYou—don't breathe on them. You're the one who came from the square. Go back down. And don't return until this is all over.
6192355001467061 Yeah, you're right.
6192355001467062 Tell them I love them, too. And I do know why.
6192355001467451 Rehearsals are boring. I prefer to learn by doing.
6192355001467452 We'll have a run-through of a small part of our play. Remember: your time is limited! At two past noon the theater will close and we'll have to part ways. So you won't be able to finish your script anyway.\nDo not despair. It's intentional.
6192355001467453 What do I need to do?
6192355001467454 Take this time to study the space and objects, warm up your vocal cords... and generally prepare for the big show.\nAnd mind the time! The stage is yours until two o'clock. Now off you go. The clock is ticking!
6192355001467455 As if it wasn't before...
6192355001467456 You're have your rehearsal, funny man, but I have business to do. Actual business...
6192355001467467 Warm up my vocal cords, huh? I can do that.
6192355001468051 So? Does anyone now care what you love and what you hate?
6192355001468052 …Fair enough. All that matters is figuring out where the strange blood came from.
6192355001468351 Nota
6192355001468352 We called and called, but you didn't hear us…
6192355001468353 Why aren't you home? Can't you see what this district is like?
6192355001469551 You look like a goof-ball... is that intentional too?
6192355001469554 I am your successor.
6192355001469555 I don't get it.
6192355001469556 It's not. You look nothing like me.
6192355001469557 I'm talking about myself. The resemblance is striking. It's like I'm the real thing.
6192355001469558 <i>I'm</i> the real thing.
6192355001469559 What are you doing here?
6192355001469560 I was looking for the courier. Same as you. Today is the day, in which the Haruspex looks for the courier.
6192355001469561 So, is he here?
6192355001469562 My stage directions went like this: "Today, the Haruspex looks for the courier." Burakh tries to ambush him, so that he doesn't deliver orders to the general. \nSo I tried to kill him, and failed.
6192355001469563 Where. Is. The courier?
6192355001469565 Who are you, man? Why do you call yourself Burakh?
6192355001469566 I don't <i>want</i> a successor. I'm not over yet.
6192355001469567 Huh… I see. Well, hello, Artemy Burakh.
6192355001469569 We can talk about <i>that.</i>
6192355001469570 Why argue? I only need to wink to those guys over there, and they'll cut you to pieces.
6192355001469571 Then explain. And keep it brief.
6192355001469572 Paid in advance… and here I am, working for free.
6192355001469573 Leave me be, human. I'll be of use to you yet. I stand between you and Death, as your successor.
6192355001469574 Fair enough…
6192355001469575 The thing is, I don't <i>like</i> you. Your performance is terrible. I'm completely different.
6192355001469576 Are you sure? Who knows. It never hurts to take a good look at yourself.
6192355001469577 Even your speech patterns are different!
6192355001469578 I'm sure.
6192355001469579 I succeed you. Don't hurt me, human. I'm your mirror. Don't kill me. I'm your guide to immortality. As you die, I'll succeed you.
6192355001469580 What?
6192355001469581 I don't want this. I'll manage on my own.
6192355001469582 Fate.
6192355001469583 Blah blah.
6192355001469584 All right. Let's play at fate, then. Where's the courier?
6192355001469586 Your directions were misleading. That's not what I'm planning to do.
6192355001469587 I think I'm starting to understand… Fine. Succeed me. I wonder how it'll end.
6192355001469588 <i>I'll</i> be the one to succeed <i>you.</i> And now I'm off to find the courier.
6192355001469589 Great job shifting the guilt.
6192355001469590 Your arms ought to be torn from their sockets. You're an impostor—if only because I still live!
6192355001469591 I don't need a <i>successor.</i> Don't replace, duplicate, or cover for me. I'm the only person named Artemy Burakh, the only one with his burden. You're not <i>here.</i>
6192355001469592 You need her blood. If you let blood out of Earth, Mother Boddho will die. Is that what you want? Boleesh, boleesh, byy alysh…
6192355001469593 I can't help it. This sacrifice must be made.
6192355001469594 If Mother Boddho dies, so do we. Zobolon, boozarlakhaa. It hurts! It frightens us. So few remain. It is not so terrible to die, but what about losing something for all time?
6192355001469595 I pity you. Pity the weak and the doomed. It's a pity when the last aurochs goes extinct…
6192355001469596 What are you talking about?
6192355001469597 Waiting for you. Waiting for you. Tell us, tell us now: Will you fulfill your duty?
6192355001469598 Sayn baina, Khatanghe. What do you want to tell me?
6192355001469599 …I've heard these words before. What duty is it now?
6192355001469600 Who are you, bizarre creatures…?
6192355001469601 We are made of Earth. Mother Boddho feeds us living blood. Suok watches us from the depths.
6192355001469602 Like shabnak-adyg…
6192355001469603 I thought this was just a dream.
6192355001469605 Your words were for your father, then. Now, speak for your mother. Mother Boddho, Earth, awaits you.
6192355001469606 What is she waiting for?
6192355001469607 Bite kharan, ubshe stands at our doorstep. A big loss. All that remains of us is here, before you.
6192355001469608 What do you fear?
6192355001469611 I know. There are few of you left.
6192355001469612 I'm not sorry for you.
6192355001469613 But… I'm nobody.
6192355001469615 Take pity on us.
6192355001469616 Why me? You are doomed. You are the past. You will inevitably die, ground down by time.
6192355001469617 Be khara, emshen chooses words carefully. Who is to judge him? But, but, take pity on us.
6192355001469618 What do you want from me?
6192355001469619 That's the opposite of what I want.
6192355001469620 Earth is killing us. Mother Boddho devours her children. She disgorged this horrible plague, so her blood will erase it. All is connected. All is as it should be.
6192355001469621 I really need that blood.
6192355001469622 This is beyond me. I'm a doctor, responsible for the Town. It is in agony, but something can still be saved.
6192355001469623 I pity you. I truly pity you.
6192355001469624 Beshe, I refuse. I cannot do it your way.
6192355001469625 Before the eyes of Kin and Earth, this I say: I, son of Mother Boddho, will not harm her. The Sky is my witness.
6192355001469626 Then this is our goodbye. Bayatay, emshen. Bayatay, essegher. Bayatay, kholboön. Bayatay, khayaala.
6192355001469627 Bayatay, Khatanghe. Oshysh daa. Go.
6192355001469628 Go. I still have time to think.
6192355001469629 Don't worry. I've changed my mind. I… I'll never betray you.
6192355001469630 Earth bore this terrible plague.
6192355001470651 
6192355001470659 
6192355001470660 
6192355001470661 
6192355001470662 
6192355001470663 
6192355001470664 
6192355001470665 
6192355001470666 
6192355001471151 What do you mean, equal? Ugh…
6192355001471152 Learned that little speech by heart, did you?
6192355001471177 I'm a doctor. You know what they say: "Everyone's on their own, and only God is on everyone's side."
6192355001471351 
6192355001471352 
6192355001471353 
6192355001471354 
6192355001471355 I don't care about Lara.
6192355001482151 Why were you calling?
6192355001482152 We saw you walk into the Cathedral. So we started shouting…
6192355001482153 Who's "we"?
6192355001482154 There, in the Tower. Or <i>on</i> the Tower, really. The air is clean there, and the disease can't touch it because it's barely connected to the ground. We're up high.\nGathering there slowly, all of us. We're gonna go inside it <i>completely.</i> And then the plague won't ever touch us.
6192355001482161 So you all crossed an infected district? What have I done to deserve this…?
6192355001482165 Apologies for the mishap.\nThe times we live in… are growing shorter, did you notice? Minutes have become shorter; hours, less productive. I guess the Cathedral is broken… Don't get angry.\nBut enough small talk. Or would you like to stay on duty a while longer?
6192355001482166 If I must.
6192355001482167 Not today. My shift is over.
6192355001482168 It's not allowed, anyway. If it's our duty now, that means it's our duty indeed. Take a stroll while you still can, doctor; you're free until tomorrow.\nOrderly number eleven, reporting in.
6192355001482169 While I "still can"? Sounds like a threat.
6192355001482173 Good luck with your shift, orderly.
6192355001482351 Are you on our side? Or are you with the mutineers?
6192355001482352 What's wrong with you all? Now isn't the time for mutinies!
6192355001482353 You the one who threw a bunch of rocks and dirt at me yesterday? 
6192355001482354 No.
6192355001482355 This is all a farce. General Block never came here. He's at the front, he's always been at the front, I'm telling you.
6192355001482356 People have seen him. Here, in the Town Hall.
6192355001482357 Where did they take the children? Where, I ask you? They're just going to grind them down to make more soldiers.
6192355001482358 They certainly didn't take them to a playground.
6192355001482359 Mark Immortell
6192355001483655 To a larger town, I suppose. Probably Nizhny or Relsk.
6192355001483656 The General contracted sand pest, I've heard. So there's no command at all—everyone's just shooting one another. Complete anarchy!\nIf it's true, who gave the order about the children? I'm scared…
6192355001483657 It was his order. He seems like the type to protect people.
6192355001483662 Those are lies, spread around so that any idiot could give out orders like they'd received them from the great hero General Block. Why would he ever come to our hellhole? We don't deserve the honor.
6192355001483663 Stranger things have happened.
6192355001483665 This isn't a hellhole anymore. It's just hell.
6192355001483667 Deserters.
6192355001483668 Then fight your deserters. You're burning people alive!
6192355001483669 Makes sense.
6192355001483670 Yes, to stop the spread of miasma… They're already dead, anyway. No one survives this pest of yours. \nSeriously, get lost! Worry about your own skin, not lecturing people.
6192355001483671 There's no miasma!
6192355001483672 Fuck you, too.
6192355001483676 Do I look like a kid flinging dirt around?
6192355001483677 Did they hurt your eye? Let me check…
6192355001483678 We got enough grief from the locals, but now our own people shoot us in the back! Lost their minds with fear. Idiots…
6192355001483679 You should have thrown trash back at them.
6192355001483680 All that military discipline broke down, huh? Is it every man for himself?
6192355001483681 You don't see it yourself?
6192355001483683 You all should leave. You didn't restore order. Just made things worse.
6192355001483684 Some wisdom: Wash your eyes well from the soil, or you'll weep pus.
6192355001483685 Don't you see I'm a civilian?
6192355001483817 
6192355001483818 
6192355001483819 
6192355001483820 
6192355001484051 Little Artemy. I remember the first time I held you in my palm… the first time I carried you on my shoulder. I taught you not to fear bulls.\nI do not know if it was any use to either of us. Perhaps it was to me. 
6192355001484052 You're Father's friend. Or used to be…
6192355001484053 Did you know that Father's been murdered?
6192355001484054 The Lines led me…
6192355001484055 Don't call me "Kindred." I've hated it since my childhood.
6192355001484056 This is the blood of an unusual creature. Half bull, half man. Looking at you made me think of it…
6192355001484058 Is this the udurgh's blood? What is it, anyway?
6192355001484061 A decent amount.
6192355001484062 They're not my people.
6192355001484065 What? Tycheek is dead…?
6192355001484066 Are you surprised?
6192355001484067 No… but that's one more tether snapped. Yet again I find myself with questions no one can answer…
6192355001484068 I guess the only hope left is that his daughter can replace him…
6192355001484069 That place is abandoned and uninhabitable.
6192355001484070 It won't work. They'll let you out of this stone tomb, but not the Town… due to the quarantine.
6192355001484071 Then take that qua-rat-thing away!
6192355001484072 I don't think I can. But I can get <i>you</i> out.
6192355001484075 No, there's ten! You've got ten fingers on your hands.
6192355001484076 That's not how it works…
6192355001484077 Lesson one… Oyun was right. I don't understand you anymore.
6192355001484105 We want justice. All must be fair. All must follow the Lines. He who has done this to us must come and observe the consequences of his actions.\nWe will not leave until this is done.
6192355001484106 And what do you plan to do? Kill him?
6192355001484107 The one who oppresses us. The one who locked us in. The Master. The owner. Fat Boös Vlad.
6192355001484108 We'll convince him. I know a magic word.
6192355001484113 He's only your master as long as you consent to be his people.
6192355001484128 He locked us in. His order destroyed our people. He turned the Warren into a coffin, an үkhedel. Tiimel daa, it is so.
6192355001484129 So what? Are you planning to stay in this coffin out of sheer stubbornness?
6192355001484130 What if it wasn't him?
6192355001484131 Mob justice, then?
6192355001484132 I won't do it.
6192355001484133 Ime beshe, he has no power over you. Go. You owe him nothing.
6192355001484134 You're right…
6192355001484251 Here, connections must be made.\n\nI must find, tame, and bind three parts of a whole, together on a sacrificial table by the Pit.
6192355001486151 Oh… You can find toolkits in shops. But rarely. But it's doable. But I don't think anyone's selling one now. But if I see one, I'll let you know.
6192355001486152 I know where to find toolkits. I wasn't born yesterday.
6192355001486153 Hm. Well, I haven't seen a single toolkit anywhere over these past few days. So if you find one, let me know.
6192355001486154 I'll find one myself… at some point.
6192355001486157 No. We can't leave yet.
6192355001486158 That's up to you. But I'm taking the girl.
6192355001486161 Who's in charge here now? Who do I talk to?
6192355001486173 How fares your kine, Khatangher? Did you hear what Mother told you?
6192355001486177 Poorly. But the Termitary is open. You're free to go.
6192355001486178 I am Isidor Burakh's son. I want to find out his fate. Tell me what you know.
6192355001489552 The doors are open. What's holding you here?
6192355001489555 Tycheek's daughter, Mother, is his successor. Be khara, you talked to her. Now you talk to us.
6192355001489556 Yes, but who makes decisions?
6192355001489557 The Kin. Mother is still young. She can't make decisions. \nWe sense each other's needs. When the Khatanghe are united, when all want the same, there's no need to decide. Everything is resolved on its own.
6192355001489558 I see…
6192355001489559 Huh… Father did tell me that the Kin are like a pack of beasts, with a single mind and sense… but I thought he was exaggerating.
6192355001489560 Be khara, you are stubborn.
6192355001489561 Ene shi yuun khun geeshebshe? What kind of person are you? Why would we talk to you? Why would we care what you want? We only care what the Kin want.
6192355001489562 The Kin want me to take Tycheek's daughter. I'll take good care of her.
6192355001489563 I hope the Kin want to leave this rotten place. I've made it possible. You're free to go.
6192355001490251 What are we going to do now?
6192355001490252 What we do best: work.
6192355001490253 I <i>will</i> try to achieve what I wanted. Revive and reform the Bull Enterprise. Now that there's nothing more to lose—and nothing is on the line—I can be more daring.
6192355001490254 We'll see about that.
6192355001490255 I don't know. Never thought about it.
6192355001490256 "We"? You and I have different paths.
6192355001490257 Everything is always on the Lines. Don't you forget that.
6192355001490259 I could tear anyone's throat out… Anyone… but now…\nLook at me, Master Burakh… A colossus with feet of clay. Heh heh… standing here, imagining my end. I still need to finish… with dignity…
6192355001490260 Are you thinking about death?
6192355001490261 That's what I think. People say… a life for a life… I took the Kin's life, but I never gave up mine…
6192355001490262 People say right.
6192355001490263 You robbed yourself.
6192355001490264 You're not alone yet. You have people who can take care of you.
6192355001490267 Dignity. That's a good word.
6192355001490269 I've got nothing to tell you.
6192355001490554 The town is dying—yet the Kin live. Perhaps this means it's the Kin's time. They'll burst from the Termitary, and take what is theirs. Sabha spoke of that. Sahba-ötün. Sahba Usp'tae. Aspity. Do you know her?
6192355001490555 What can you know of the Lines, child?
6192355001490556 Blood seeps from underground in this place. Do you know where it comes from?
6192355001490557 Why can't anyone get in?
6192355001490558 Because there is a plague. Because there is no one here to lead the bulls from the steppe through the Gates of Labor.\nDo not flaunt your ignorance, akhar. Incredible… Isidor's son is back, and knows not how the Ford works… Shudkher!
6192355001490559 I know that "olonngo" means "ford." Enough for me.
6192355001490560 You have an odd pattern of speech… not that many steppe words. Are you humoring me? There's no need—I know our tongue. Ukherney ereed baina gүү.
6192355001490561 I need to understand what sort of blood it is. Can you tell me?
6192355001490562 Let me think…
6192355001490563 You look…bad. Could you possibly be infected too?
6192355001490564 Go ahead. I'll wait.
6192355001490565 Well, I can see you're frank. Even if you are broken, you were Father's friend.
6192355001490566 Be quiet. You don't know what kind of person I am.
6192355001490567 I'm just trying to find my own path. Father used to be so confident…
6192355001490568 Likewise. I'm not Father. I'm different. Sorry to disappoint.
6192355001490569 I am no one. The Kin's fingernail. A fleck of their skin. What can I do?\nYour questions, your words… must be addressed to the Kin. But one must learn to talk to them. And you don't have the skill.
6192355001490570 That's why I'm talking to you.
6192355001490571 I'm part of the Kin, too. Their fingernail; a fleck of their skin.
6192355001490572 How <i>does</i> one talk to the Kin? Even Father couldn't.
6192355001490573 This is… difficult to explain. Instead you should see. You'll need to come with me—to the Abattoir.
6192355001490574 Then let's go! You're the Foreman of the Abattoir—who's gonna stop you?
6192355001490575 Where the hell have you been, Foreman of the Abattoir?
6192355001490576 So…the blood was collected here? I didn't know. Truthfully, it was my friend who made the cure… Father's student. Stakh Rubin.
6192355001490577 Kindred. You won't understand even if I tell you. As if I spoke a foreign language.\nYou have no udhar—no warm vessel—to hold my answer. You're armless for now. I'd give you an answer, but it'd fall to the ground.
6192355001490578 Armless? Wow. No one's ever called me <i>that.</i>
6192355001490579 And you call yourself Father's friend…
6192355001490580 What results?
6192355001490581 The son killed several thousand people. And he knows it. He was the one who locked up the Termitary.
6192355001490582 What do you mean…?
6192355001490583 I mean what I said. He's the one who did it. On the night of your arrival.
6192355001490584 …
6192355001490585 …Why?
6192355001490587 What makes you think we're the ones making these choices?
6192355001490588 Who else?
6192355001490589 The Olgimskys themselves.
6192355001490590 Fair enough.
6192355001490591 Very funny.
6192355001490592 Yeah, I'm in stitches.
6192355001490593 So what do we do…?
6192355001490594 I wish they'd both rot. Bloodsuckers, both of them, each in their own way.
6192355001490595 You're good at guilt-tripping people, girl saint.
6192355001490596 Why would you say that? I'm a good person—a <i>good person!</i>
6192355001490597 I'll talk to Young Vlad myself. And talk him out of it.
6192355001490598 You've been there.
6192355001490599 I have.
6192355001490600 Do you realize what you've done? You, and all the Olgimskys!
6192355001490601 A riot among the Kin? What the fuck do you mean? They've been struggling under your yoke for sixty years, and they never lifted a finger!
6192355001490602 Stop yelling at me! That's just what I've been told! Can you imagine what Father would have done if he'd learned about a strike—not to mention a riot?!
6192355001490603 Yeah… I can.
6192355001490604 What—you think he'd have gunned down a protest? Saburov wouldn't have let him! We didn't even have weapons.
6192355001490605 No one could have known about it… Indeed.
6192355001490606 Don't go. You can't fix this.
6192355001490607 You fucking murderer… Do you even realize what you've done, you monster?
6192355001490608 This is a brave decision. Go. Look them in the eye.
6192355001490609 I can guess, my boy… I can guess… If everything there was all right, you wouldn't barge in here with your eyes so wide…\nHow many…?
6192355001490610 How many what?
6192355001490611 All of them, as far as you are concerned.
6192355001490612 What?
6192355001490613 He's going to them. To us. What don't you understand?
6192355001490614 You have come. The body is whole now.
6192355001490615 Were you talking?
6192355001491151 
6192355001491152 Thrush
6192355001491153 Measly
6192355001491451 
6192355001491452 
6192355001491453 The Army's in town. Artillery. Alexander Block, a legendary general, the hero of our disgraceful war.\n\nThey've set up their headquarters in the Town Hall.
6192355001492379 My scouts reported that you blacked out in the Town. I came here to check on you.\nYou look better than you did two minutes ago. Have you taken the immunity boosters?
6192355001492380 Your scout is a bit too young. I don't like it.
6192355001492415 
6192355001492416 
6192355001492417 She told me to report daily. So I will. Strange. Such a beautiful Line, even if misplaced.
6192355001492418 Time to see Aglaya.
6192355001492419 Time to see Aglaya again.
6192355001492420 <i>The sound of paper crushed and thrown away. She's not calling, but you should come. Right now. She needs you.</i>
6192355001492427 Burakh—get out. Just get out. Am I making myself clear?\nBut thank you for the rehearsal. I've looked one of you in the eyes now. And I must bear… however many there are. I hope there's plenty.
6192355001492428 Fine. If you refuse to listen, I'll find another way to stop you.
6192355001492429 There's four hundred or so…
6192355001492430 Your son is on his way there. He'll do the counting.
6192355001492431 So you do care about your son, after all?
6192355001492432 What…?\nDon't you dare try to pry into my soul! This is my son. This is my sin. We'll figure things out on our own, he and I… No assistance required. Get lost.
6192355001492433 Wait any longer, and you won't have a son at all. Because he's going to them.
6192355001492434 Look them in the eyes, boös. Gaze into the eyes of your remaining workers.
6192355001492435  Tomorrow my workers will go and labour. Their job is to butcher bulls and not to have staring contests, master Burakh.
6192355001492436  In that case, someone else will meet their gaze, master Olgimsky.
6192355001492437 I don't suppose I'll ever find out what Rubin had made his cure from. But strange blood seeps from the ground "by the Ear."\n\nShekhen. The Ear is in Shekhen.
6192355001492438 
6192355001492439 The blood is in the Abattoir. Foreman Oyun will let me in. But it'll take time. I'll have to wait.
6192355001492440 The Termitary has been devoured by the disease. Tycheek is dead. The Kin have truly become orphaned.\n\n…What does this mean for me?
6192355001492441 
6192355001492442 The Kin's body is whole. The survivors have left for Shekhen.
6192355001492443 How fares your kine, esegher?
6192355001492444 How fares your kine, Khatanghe? Is everything all right?
6192355001492445 I've seen my people's true face. Now is the time to teach them to see one another.
6192355001492446 You know what? The Khatanghe are baking me oatmeal talh. I demanded it sweet! I'll share with you too, if you come to live with us.
6192355001492447 No. But I'll come to visit.
6192355001492448 The Kin are free.
6192355001492449 
6192355001492450 
6192355001492452 You do look like a healthy lad.
6192355001492455 Yeah. You were lying down, not moving at all. Like a corpse…
6192355001492456 A spot-on description of my overall condition.
6192355001494152 Oh, I see a purse walking in? Or are you here to bust me?\nDon't you try anything funny! I'm the only one left selling food for coin now. You won't find a second merchant like me in the whole Town!
6192355001494153 Huh? What do you mean?
6192355001494154 Secretary
6192355001494155 Here to get coupons?
6192355001494156 What coupons?
6192355001494157 Here to get coupons?
6192355001494158 Yes.
6192355001494159 
6192355001494160 
6192355001494161 Aglaya is busy. Now is not the time to see her.
6192355001494163 Grocery
6192355001494164 Pharmacy
6192355001495551 Are you their leader, Notkin?
6192355001495552 It's dangerous to just lie down in the streets here, especially if you're still alive. Our scouts were brave to use their medicine dragging you out.\nStill, we need to talk about this.
6192355001495553 Let's talk, then.
6192355001495554 I gave them an order to not assist any more infected people. Unless it's one of ours.
6192355001495555 Why?
6192355001495556 The last thing I want is for you to play medical personnel! We have orderlies—the beakheads. No beak, no business in infected districts!
6192355001495557 Are you afraid of infection? You lurk in those districts anyway, making that map of yours…
6192355001495558 It's one thing to walk the streets, another to touch the sick. You know the difference.
6192355001495559 And neither of those is your business!
6192355001495560 We're low on immunity boosters, and we're entirely out of shmowders.\nWhat I mean is, be careful. If you fall in the street again, we can't help.
6192355001495561 I won't fall.
6192355001495563 I can't believe my ears. Could it be that at least one of my pleas got through to you?
6192355001495565 Thank heavens!
6192355001495651 Quite so.
6192355001495652 Any chance you might have seen the hunger and ruin going around? It's called "emergency conditions."\nTo help you maintain a semblance of life, our kind benefactor, Inquisitor Aglaya Lilich, introduced centralized distribution of food in exchange for coupons. It's called "rationing due to low stock."
6192355001495653 Centralized distribution? One piece of toast per person?
6192355001495654 Don't offer money to the merchants. We've got ears everywhere. You'll get whatever the Inquisitor decides you're worthy of. It's called "basic provisions."\nSo are you taking the coupons or not?
6192355001495655 Sure.
6192355001495656 Keep them. I'll find sane merchants.
6192355001495657 Well done learning all those long words. What do I do with money now?
6192355001495658 No, just to chat.
6192355001495659 You still take money? That's useful. Think you'll stay in business long?
6192355001495660 Long enough if you turn your pockets out. It's not like the candy wrapper lady is here forever. It'll all calm down in a week, or sooner if someone puts her in a box. I'll have a whole vault of wealth by then.\nSo? What will it be? Gawking or trading?
6192355001495661 You're a sly one. Show me your goods.
6192355001495662 Think we've only got a week left?
6192355001495663 Ugh, clueless sod.\nThe big-city wench forbade coin. Now it's all about those coupons. Try to survive just eating whatever you can trade for her candy wrappers. Oh, and share it all with everyone else! A dictator, she is.
6192355001495664 But you're still selling food, against her law? Bold. Think you'll keep this business running long?
6192355001496051 
6192355001496052 
6192355001496053 I've protected everyone I could, as much as I could.
6192355001496551 A schism grew among us. Because of you, emshen. We can't go anywhere split.\nWe are a single body. We cannot leave a limb behind. It will not let us grow into a new life. Remember what Mother told you about fingers? 
6192355001496552 A schism? Really?
6192355001496553 Because of <i>me?</i> How?
6192355001496554 Once again, I've barely arrived in a place before I'm considered guilty.
6192355001496555 No. Nothing to be happy about…
6192355001496556 I guess I am.
6192355001496557 I'll lead them away from here. Perhaps you'll still have a chance.
6192355001496558 I don't know.
6192355001496559 What's going to happen next?
6192355001496561 What can I do for you now?
6192355001496562 Nothing. It is done already.
6192355001496563 Fine.
6192355001496564 Cheer up. I'll lead them away from here soon. That's why I brought you here in the first place…
6192355001496565 In the end, you would have become just like your father. As long as they slaved away for you, everything would have stayed the same.
6192355001496566 And put their elders on the town council?
6192355001496630 The Tower is connected to the source of the outbreak, Burakh.
6192355001496631 A strange conclusion. Do you have proof?
6192355001496634 Look for the source of the blood. I've made some progress on this matter.
6192355001496637 Report.
6192355001496638 Oyun, the Foreman of the Abattoir, is back from the steppe. He might know something.
6192355001496639 Your Oyun knows nothing. He tried to find those… brontosauruses of yours in the steppe, only to learn they're extinct. Any more bright ideas?
6192355001496640 I need to go to the Abattoir. I've always wanted to.
6192355001496641 I think I should look into the Abattoir…
6192355001496642 Do you know what you'd be looking for? Or is it just a shot in the dark?
6192355001496643 A shot in the dark.
6192355001496644 I'm relying on Oyun. He promised to find out…
6192355001496645 We have no time for hope and luck, Burakh! No time at all!
6192355001496646 I'm not the inquisitor here! I'm doing my best.
6192355001496647 I know.
6192355001496648 I don't know…
6192355001496649 You're the inquisitor. Not me.
6192355001496650 And what should I do about it?
6192355001497551 Also, the Khatanghe are making me a necklace from chuulu and berry stones. Davuu erh, only I am allowed to wear that!
6192355001497552 You're the prettiest here, anyway.
6192355001497554 Also, the Khatanghe are stuffing pillows for me! I want a pillow takh! And they're carving a wooden step, so I could sit higher than anyone, softer than anyone, and prettier than anyone! Tiimel daa!
6192355001497555 Wow! So where will your Not-So-Highness reside?
6192355001498051 Let someone else worry about what the source was… I'm more interested in curing this pest.
6192355001498452 Imagine an arm torn from a body. Hanging by loose skin, unattachable. One can't cut his own arm off, either. Too painful, lacking will.\nSo a yargachin is needed to cut it. It will hurt, yes. Will be terrible. But someone has to do it. You know the Lines? So trace them.
6192355001498453 I know many Lines. A wise man follows his own—not the shortest.
6192355001498454 I'll need a weapon.
6192355001498455 Connected? How?
6192355001498456 But you can't cure it. You have nothing from which to make your panacea. Therefore, we must at least purge the source, so we can prevent this catastrophe from ever repeating. Wouldn't you agree?
6192355001498457 Apples and oranges. It's just a building! What does it have to do with the disease?
6192355001498458 I hope you know what you're doing.
6192355001498459 The Olgimskys have no power anymore. They locked up the Termitary. The culprit will be judged.
6192355001498460 The justice of the Kin is swift and terrible.
6192355001498461 Well… no one tore them to pieces when I was there.
6192355001498462 That's because you were there.
6192355001498463 …Think I should go back? Interfere in some way?
6192355001498464 They deserve it.
6192355001498465 I know. I want them to leave too.
6192355001498466 They'll just look their former owners in the eye.
6192355001498467 Same thing. Don't you know how the Kin does its eye-touch?
6192355001498468 No.
6192355001498469 I can guess…
6192355001498470 You will have to prove your strength to the Kin. Prove that not only do you know the Lines, Kindred, but that you can also trace them with your knife. Prove you're a yargachin like your father, too.\nThey won't listen to you until you do. And they won't accept your help. You are still no one.
6192355001498471 That's what they said.
6192355001498472 I don't want to follow the path of strength. Father didn't.
6192355001498473 Because I was there to help him! Because the Olgimskys forced them into submission, and I—their watchdog—sacrificed my <i>name</i> to drag them by the yoke wherever they'd be fed!\nOur people only understand strength. Strength alone! They don't think. They don't fear death. They need to be dragged from its door—by the yoke!
6192355001498474 You're talking like a yoke's part of the body. It isn't. It can be removed.
6192355001498475 And?
6192355001498476 And I agree. I'll accept authority over them if I have to.
6192355001498477 I don't want power. Father led by example. As a teacher. He never gave orders…
6192355001498478 No, Khatangher, I'm not convinced. There's an untruth… a false Line, if you will.
6192355001498479 What can bind you to them that is stronger than blood? Such is blood's main quality: it binds. Binds people. Binds organs. Binds the world.
6192355001498480 I guess, but…
6192355001498481 They made me drag out Olgimsky for them to tear apart.
6192355001498482 Which one?
6192355001498483 Who cares? But the Bull Enterprise is no more.
6192355001498484 The son.
6192355001498485 The father.
6192355001498486 As if a deed can't be bloodless.
6192355001498487 Blood isn't the only thing that binds.
6192355001498488 What do they want from you right now? Why won't they leave that tomb?
6192355001498489 They want me to kill those who reject communal thought.
6192355001498490 They're acting stupid. If they want to die, let them. Cutting off the nose to spite the face…
6192355001498491 So kill them.
6192355001498492 Easier said than done…
6192355001498493 Are you afraid to taint yourself with blood? You're a yargachin! It's not your place to fear blood.
6192355001498494 Yes, I'm afraid.
6192355001498495 We won't ever speak the common tongue. You only have the one word for surgeons and butchers, Khatangher! Can't you see the difference between a murder and an amputation?
6192355001498496 No, I can't. You shouldn't, either.
6192355001498497 I have a conscience.
6192355001498498 It's not that. I hate being forced into things. You're pushing me. And so are they. You can all go to hell.
6192355001498499 They're living beings, not cells in one body! Each has a soul. A face, a voice, a self. 
6192355001498500 You are wrong, Kindred. You're whining like a child, wavering for no reason.\nDo what they want! They don't <i>care.</i> We, the Khatanghe, do not feel death—only life. And life means <i>unity,</i> the collective, to us. Kill the few who stand apart to spare the rest! Pay that price. And then teach the Kin your truth, and lead them wherever you please.
6192355001498501 Fine. I guess you're right. "Few" is an understatement, though… I'll need a weapon.
6192355001498502 I'll find another way. I will. My knife will trace a different Line.
6192355001498503 I'll think about it.
6192355001498504 You tell me. But I've found my own way.
6192355001498505 Be khara, that was truly a powerful deed. Medengshe, you have made some of us rethink our ideas.
6192355001498506 Really? Well, then it really was an achievement.
6192355001498507 I'm glad you understand. Now go back to Shekhen.
6192355001498553 
6192355001498554 
6192355001498555 
6192355001498853 I haven't been to the river yet.
6192355001498854 Running late? Forgetting the script?\nThat's fine. <i>I've</i> been there. I succeed you. Today is the day in which the Haruspex looks for the courier.
6192355001498855 I'm not <i>forgetting the script!</i> I made a choice. I <i>chose</i> to come here first!
6192355001498856 How can you "succeed" me if we're both here at the same time?
6192355001498857 You made a choice. Yes. Choice is a connection, too. Existence and nonexistence go hand in hand. It doesn't matter if you went left or right; what matters is that you've been to the crossroads.\nYou chose to choose.
6192355001498858 I chose a different path than you. That means we're different.
6192355001499051 I thought I was a Mistress… That it was my destiny to defeat this plague… but it turned out differently.\nI guess this is goodbye, Artemy.
6192355001499052 No way in hell. First, there's nothing good about any of this. Second, I won't give up on you. I'll help you.
6192355001499055 Ah, Burakh. You are the only doctor who comes as he pleases, before a patient calls.
6192355001499056 You're not a stranger to me, you know.
6192355001499057  
6192355001499058  
6192355001499059 My throat is all dry… Everything is dry. I'd like a drink of water. But… no. No more water for me.
6192355001499060 I know what that feels like, kiddo. I've experienced it too.
6192355001499063 I sent Jester away. He kept trying to get close to me, silly cat. I told him to stay in the corner! He could catch it too…
6192355001499064 I still can't see him… your familiar.
6192355001499067  
6192355001499068  
6192355001499069 .....
6192355001499070 You're all too independent! Scattered around like a bunch of cubs... Do you know where Grace is now?
6192355001499153  
6192355001499154  
6192355001499155 Bayarlaa… My kine fares poorly. 
6192355001499159  
6192355001499160  
6192355001499453 We'll shoot her today! That's the order. She can't run from a bullet.
6192355001499454 Shoot whom?
6192355001499455 Did you hear? They shot that inquisitor woman down.
6192355001499456 What? Why?
6192355001499460 
6192355001499461 
6192355001499462 
6192355001499463 
6192355001499464 
6192355001499465 
6192355001499466 Whose order?
6192355001499469 
6192355001499470 
6192355001499551 He caught it while evacuating everyone under the age of sixteen.
6192355001499552 What do you think you're doing?!
6192355001499555 The door is over there, doctor.
6192355001499556 I don't like this at all. Does the commissar, Aglaya Lilich, know about this?
6192355001499557 Over. There.
6192355001499558 I'm not one of your junior officers… lieutenant.
6192355001499559 You people are dousing fire with kerosene.
6192355001499751 Wounded Bandit
6192355001499752 What do you want?
6192355001499753 I do.
6192355001499754 Our kids are <i>gone.</i> They won't ever return. I can tell.
6192355001499756 You the one the kids call Cub?
6192355001499757 Sure. What do you want?
6192355001499758 Have a drink, pal. Drunks will be safe.
6192355001499759 No, it just feels that way to you. Liquid courage.
6192355001499760 No, I don't. It's not that simple. I still have some time to think.
6192355001499761 I won't.
6192355001499762 Don't push it!
6192355001499763 You are mistaken, oynon. There's dissent among the soldiers. If the orders are not delivered, there will be no bombardment at all.
6192355001499764 So there won't be.
6192355001499765 We'll see about that.
6192355001499766 But killing a person…
6192355001499768 Why must you always intrude upon children? You don't belong here.
6192355001499769 You must be confused. We're not in the Polyhedron.
6192355001499770 Hey uncle, are the Dogheads done for? Or is there a mutiny?
6192355001499771 I don't know. What makes you think so?
6192355001499772 Caspar Kain moved to the Nutshell? What in the world has compelled him to leave the Polyhedron?
6192355001499773 Caspar Kain lives here—temporarily. His leaderless kingdom of children remains in the Polyhedron.
6192355001499776 ....
6192355001499777 Back now? Good boy… Have you brought me anything?
6192355001499778 ....
6192355001499779 You've got a thousand-yard stare… Must have seen a lot of shit.
6192355001499780 Ukherney ereed baina gyy?
6192355001499781 Medene ugye, kharaa ugyb… I don't know, I haven't seen them…
6192355001500051 Oral disinfectant doesn't work. You're better off washing your hands.
6192355001500069 So it is you, then. My daughter wanted me to relay something to you… before they took her away.
6192355001500070 Did it have anything to do with time and fate?
6192355001500075 She wanted me to give you a note. Said you'd be in "big trouble," otherwise. Now, where I'd put it… in a pocket… a small piece…
6192355001500076 Oh, this is definitely about fate.
6192355001500078 Not just Cub. When they want me to play a game with them, they call me uncle. Also when they tell me I'm bad at the game.
6192355001500751 Medehegshe, your father led the Kin the wrong way. He wanted us to dissolve in the Town.\nWe want to dissolve in Earth, our Mother Boddho. Dissolving in her belly, we will return. Dissolving in the Town, we will fade forever. It will devour us.
6192355001500752 Father was wise. The time of the Kin is at an end. As a rare branch to a seedling, so must we graft the Kin to the Town. That's your only chance to save anything at all.
6192355001500753 Baygalday, Khatanghe. I will leave. But first, I want to talk to you—instead of killing.
6192355001500754 Better kill us. We don't want to follow the Line of Burakh.
6192355001500755 What do you mean, Khatangher?
6192355001500756 Father didn't lead. He didn't drag you anywhere. He just took care of you.
6192355001500757 I will lead you differently.
6192355001500758 Be khara, you are truly your father's son. Hence, we don't need you.
6192355001500759 I am Father's son, and I will continue his Line. But that doesn't mean I'll trace it the same way he did.
6192355001500760 You think you know the Lines, kholboön?
6192355001500761 Be oylgono ugyb… Which way would you lead us? How would you make the cut?
6192355001500762 I came to connect, instead of cutting. Father tore old connections apart. The Town and the Kin were sewn together wrong. The Town of Men was sewn to the new Town of Children on the other side—poorly, against the guidance of the Lines. That made everyone suffer. You're too different. Our worlds are too different.
6192355001500763 You speak wisely, emshen. What do you want to do about it?
6192355001500764 Our bones have intergrown all wrong. The Town was killing itself. That's why the sand plague keeps coming back. So Father broke those bones.
6192355001500765 No. I'm different. I'm not Father's reflection.
6192355001500766 I spoke with Father. I realize now what he wanted.
6192355001500767 When a fracture fuses wrong, doctors break the bone again and put on a splint—to fuse it right. To cure lameness, to let the patient walk again.
6192355001500768 You are a yargachin.
6192355001500769 If I make those new connections, blood will flow again through our common body.
6192355001500770 I'll tell you the truth: I don't know yet. I only know that I will connect what Father has torn apart. My Lines aren't cuts, but connections. Veins. Nerves. Tissue.
6192355001500771 So many different living creatures inhabit our small patch of land. Alive, all of them. All connected with the same flow… A tohonto, an umbilical cord.
6192355001500772 So you acknowledge me?
6192355001500773 Do you promise to do so?
6192355001500774 No. I can't. Empty promises are worthless. But I'll try. And if I fail, my son will continue after me. This is what connections are all about.
6192355001500775 I do.
6192355001500777 Fine. We're curious to see. But woe to you or your successor if you fail.
6192355001500778 If I fail, woe to us all.
6192355001500779 Bayarlaa, Khatanghe. Now it's time for you to go to Shekhen.
6192355001500780 You want to see? Then watch. I have just tied the Kin back together. And still you doubt?
6192355001500781 We saw this when you answered our first question well. Bayarlaa, emshen. Let Mother Boddho caress your step.
6192355001500782 Be khara, I could use your good wishes.
6192355001500783 Go to Shekhen. Let Mother Boddho hold you to her bosom.
6192355001500784 Bayarlaa, esegher. We thank you for what you have done for our body. You are a yargachin. You are an emshen.
6192355001500785 Now tell me: What do you know about Father's death?
6192355001500786 What is an udurgh, Khatangher? I want to hear an answer from everyone who knows the word.
6192355001500787 What was my father's duty? Why did Earth reject him?
6192355001500788 Boleesh, boleesh… Who do you ask? I am but the Kin's hangnail, a fleck of their skin. I don't know that.
6192355001500789 Who does, then? Our Mother Superior? A six-year-old child?
6192355001500790 Have any of the elders survived?
6192355001500791 No.
6192355001500792 Then ask everyone you can. Gather a council in Shekhen. I'll come to you later for your answer.
6192355001500793 Fine. You'll leave this poisonous grave now, and soon. Otherwise the last person who might remember anything will die. We'll talk later.
6192355001500794 Why talk? You have come, so we are now whole. Among us blood, thoughts, words, all flow in our veins. No need for mouths. Listen. You know everything already.
6192355001500795 The udurgh is our town—or more precisely, its unity with Earth.
6192355001500796 I've come for answers. Are you ready to give them?
6192355001500797 Udurgh are the connections between all living things, however different. From a sand pest microbe to Mother Boddho.
6192355001500798 An udurgh is a toonto nuutag. A family. "A place that conceals the umbilical cord."
6192355001500799 Tiimeel daa, you're right. You are an emshen.
6192355001500800 My father's duty was to connect the Town again.
6192355001500801 Father tore apart the weak, diseased connections that caused this outbreak. But he failed to make new ones. That's why Earth refused to accept him.
6192355001500802 It doesn't matter what Father's duty was. What matters is that I accepted it. Succeeded him. And continued his Line.
6192355001500803 Father's duty was to protect the small, the weak, and the doomed. The ones that make life more beautiful… and the ones that make it <i>more.</i> Now and in the future.
6192355001500804 Tiimeel da, you're right. You are a yagarchin. We listen to your words; we nod in agreement. It's all true.
6192355001500805 You'd agree with anything I say!
6192355001500806 Wherever I look, everything's true… as if there were no lies in the world, eh?
6192355001500807 Bite kharaan, you have finally grasped the ultimate truth. Suok, the counterpart of our Mother Boddho, is death. And so we do not fear death.
6192355001500808 You'd nod in agreement with <i>whatever</i> I told you! Like what if I told you Father had been killed by a friend? Out of love, of course, and with the best of intentions. Would you nod along to this bullshit too?
6192355001500809 Hey, maybe <i>I</i> killed Father? That's what Rubin thought at first, anyway.
6192355001500810 The causes of Burakh-esegher's death were many.\nHe sought death and surrendered to it voluntarily. Was he the murderer? Suok touched him. Was she the murderer? You failed to reach him in time. Were you the murderer?
6192355001500811 No.
6192355001500812 It is so. You speak the truth. You know all the answers.\nThe body is whole… and knowledge flows through its veins. Listen to us all, including those who do not now stand here. You are part of the whole body.
6192355001500813 …It was Oyun.
6192355001500814 This is what our people said. Now you know.
6192355001500815 And you never told me!
6192355001500816 Who is to tell the truth but you? Why give away a man who seeks death?\nTrace the Line, yagarchin. You are in charge of us. We cannot force your hand.
6192355001500817 And he's not here, either. Cut himself off from the whole in advance…
6192355001500818 Yes. Now I know.
6192355001500819 Be kharanab… I knew this already…
6192355001500820 Bayarlaa, Khatanghe. I've learned all I wanted. Now it's time for me to return to the Town.
6192355001500851 
6192355001500852 
6192355001500853 
6192355001500854 
6192355001500855 
6192355001500856 
6192355001500857 
6192355001500858 
6192355001500859 
6192355001501151 …A wound in Earth's body?
6192355001501152 Yes, Burakh. Earth's body. The ground is special here. Wait. You didn't know?
6192355001501153 It's just a tale. A local legend.
6192355001501154 Our ground is normal.
6192355001501155 The three of you are solving it together. You, Dankovsky, and Clara the amnesiac. Each is looking for their piece. I never fail in such matters. But forget it. I found out your part myself.
6192355001501156 I just… didn't have enough time.
6192355001501157 What have you found out?
6192355001501158 Well, I've discovered your blood. It's underground.\nThere are caverns beneath the Abattoir. The blood of your ritual bulls was poured there. It doesn't rot. It's unclear why. It's abnormally vital—it even seeps to the surface sometimes.\nIs it true that it's forbidden to dig wells in this town?
6192355001501159 I see now. "All blood seeps from Olonngo…"
6192355001501160 Damn…
6192355001501161 Cheer up. If not for you, my thoughts wouldn't have gone that direction.\nIt won't bother me if you consider this a shared achievement.
6192355001501162 What do you plan to do now?
6192355001501166 …I understand. Now please be quiet for… twenty-five seconds. I need to think.
6192355001501167 …
6192355001501168 […twenty one …twenty two …twenty three …twenty four…]
6192355001501169 There is blood underground. The Polyhedron's base pierces the soil. Like an arrow's barb buried in a torso.\nSo all we need is to pull out the arrow.
6192355001501170 …And then blood will pour out, killing the wounded.
6192355001501171 Huh. I expected you to suggest that we demolish the Abattoir.
6192355001501172 You made that decision suspiciously fast…
6192355001501173 No. The last thing I need is a riot.
6192355001501174 So you're not afraid of children rioting…?
6192355001501175 It feels like you hate the Tower and are searching for an excuse.
6192355001501180 Thank you, doctor. You have assisted me in solving a puzzle. Nothing more is required of you.\nStandby until blood pours from the ground. Be ready to make a great deal of your medicine.
6192355001501181 That's it? So in your plans, I'm just benched…
6192355001501182 Wait. You don't understand! You can't just bleed the Earth dry! If it's truly a living creature, it will die.
6192355001501183 Bayarlaa for the honor… basaghan.
6192355001501187 …Get some rest, doctor. You're clearly overworked. Do something else. Or are you not busy enough as it is?
6192355001501188 I thought inquisitors were required to be open to belief in the impossible.
6192355001501189 You just don't care. Puzzle solved, right? To hell with everything else.
6192355001501190 No. Nothing surprises me anymore.
6192355001501191 Don't judge a book by its cover. Sometimes, people form unexpected connections!\nImagine—two people living in completely different worlds. Different habits, educations, and hobbies. But when they meet, their souls resonate! Connections like that make the world more… vibrant.
6192355001501192 Huh. You're the last person I expected to talk to me about connections.
6192355001501193 More philosophy.
6192355001501194 Sure. For adults. Not young girls…
6192355001501195 Volunteer?
6192355001501196 I work here, doctor. Don't you recognize me? I'm an orderly, same as everyone. This ain't even my first shift… I just don't have the costume today.\nWe're ordinary people under the masks.
6192355001501197 Right. Of course.
6192355001502951 
6192355001502952 
6192355001502953 
6192355001502954 
6192355001502955 "Don't even think about going to the Nutshell. Khan got down, and it has solid walls. And he tries to cross them. And they won't budge. I saw it too. He's angry like a ferret."
6192355001502956 Touch to read it. It's better to put it back after.
6192355001502957 Hasty Note
6192355001503399 "Proverbs are stories, just seen from a distance. Is this too much for you even to listen? Guess all you feel is seething indifference."
6192355001503400 What do you mean?
6192355001503401 Once again, I prove that first impressions have never failed me. The initial hypothesis is almost always correct. That's exactly how things turned out to be… literally <i>and</i> metaphysically.
6192355001503402 How is that possible?
6192355001503403 The Bachelor helped me figure it out. He spoke to the Stamatins, the Kains… many people. I don't have time to give a full accounting.\nWe meet here for <i>you</i> to report to <i>me,</i> not vice versa. And I haven't had sufficient sleep for far too long. Even I have my limits.
6192355001503404 Well, if you've figured it out, at least tell me how it remains in the air.
6192355001503407 …I was right, of course. The outbreak was caused by the Tower's creation. Both outbreaks, actually. This is the second time sand pest has occurred in this town, correct?
6192355001503408 It must feel great to solve a riddle when you already know the answer.
6192355001503409 Metaphysically? Are you for real?
6192355001503410 When was the Tower built?
6192355001503411 Damn…
6192355001503412 The ability to correlate facts is a useful skill to any investigator, Burakh. And a surgeon often serves as one too, wouldn't you agree?
6192355001503413 Eh.
6192355001503414 Yes. The First Outbreak happened five years ago.
6192355001503415 I'm a surgeon, not a diagnostician.
6192355001503416 Coincidences happen.
6192355001503417 Any attempt to subvert nature is met with resistance. That's the… <i>nature</i> of nature. Such is the matter you're made of, whether a person or a town.\nThey tried to subvert nature. It retaliated. The case is clear.
6192355001503418 Can you prove this?
6192355001503419 How exactly does it work?
6192355001503423 What would you have me report?
6192355001503424 Tell me, Artemy Burakh. Are you healthy? Are you thinking clearly?
6192355001503425 Oh. Yes, of course, the cure… I think I've found it.
6192355001503426 Then why exactly are we discussing doomed architecture?
6192355001503427 I know it might sound mad, but there may be blood underground. Lots of it.
6192355001503428 Clearly enough.
6192355001503429 I can tell it's a poem. But I don't know where it's from. And I can't recite it with you.
6192355001503430 Calm down… I'd prefer you not have a heart attack. I was speaking figuratively. Were you… speaking literally?
6192355001503431 Yes.
6192355001503432 The soil is… special here. The blood may still be used to make a panacea.
6192355001503435 Imagine a circulatory system below the Town. A maze of tunnels and chambers… Somewhere down there, blood flows.
6192355001503436 We could extract the blood. But digging wells is forbidden here, and no one would let us drill. Damn it! Wait…
6192355001503438 They've been evacuated. First thing the general did.\nI must give credit where it's merited—he's a remarkable individual. Especially for a military commander.
6192355001503439 Evacuated? When?
6192355001503440 What a lucky coincidence. Your doing, too?
6192355001503441 In the morning. And we aren't going to discuss it now.
6192355001503442 A town without children… Was this your doing, too?
6192355001503443 Strange. I thought Earth was your area of expertise. I was sure you'd be the one to uncover this part of the puzzle.
6192355001503444 Why did you think so?
6192355001503445 Who told you all this?
6192355001503446 Not you.
6192355001503447 I was busy caring for living people!
6192355001503448 What's your plan now?
6192355001503449 I am. And I feel like the real work's just beginning…
6192355001503450 You can't know it. For you, it's not yet written.
6192355001503551 Where's Rubin?
6192355001503552 No idea, doctor. Asleep, I guess. I hope. He's dead tired… been towing this whole hospital along on his own.
6192355001503553 Not on his own.
6192355001503554 I don't like this…
6192355001503555 And it's clearly run aground without him.
6192355001503556 A Kains' man all right.
6192355001503557 And what were you doing? Why haven't the bodies been taken away?
6192355001503558 They did all that while you just stood there? Worker of the year material!
6192355001503559 Don't raise your voice at me. It's a theatre, not a hospital, and I'm a coal-heaver, not a doctor. No one ever taught us how to fight the plague.\nShe's a cunning minx… mixing the dead and the living into one. One day she's silent, and the next she mows down a hundred. She'll mow your folk down too, mark my word…\nWe're doing the best we can.
6192355001503560 Your best sucks.
6192355001503561 She won't mow mine down. I take care of them.
6192355001503562 So what are our orders for today?
6192355001503563 We need to find the survivors in this meat grinder and return them to proper beds. Stat. I'll do it myself. You… heave some coal, coal-heaver.
6192355001503564 Prepare bandages and warm water. When I bring the survivors, you'll need to wash them.
6192355001503565 Orderly

6192355001503570 Victoria Olgimskaya
6192355001503571 ???
6192355001503572 Nara
6192355001503573 I have nothing to report. Sorry.
6192355001503579 Do you know what our Cathedral is for?
6192355001503580 Not for service, that's for sure.
6192355001503582 Tell me.
6192355001503588 No one knows what the Kains' creations are for. The Polyhedron, the Cathedral, those dilapidated stairs… Do you even know yourself?
6192355001503590 It produces time.
6192355001503591 Meaning…?
6192355001503592 Like trees produce wind?
6192355001503593 Literally.
6192355001503594 I'm no physicist, but this is bullshit.
6192355001503595 All over the world? Or just in our town?
6192355001503596 Can this… production be stopped?
6192355001503597 Great question. You're an astute man, Doctor Burakh… Just like your father.\nTime is more complicated than we think. We perceive it as homogenous, uniform, and continuous. The key word being "perceive."
6192355001503598 Is our perception wrong?
6192355001503599 That's a lot of long words. I'm lost.
6192355001503600 There was a time when people believed the Sun rotated around an immobile Earth. It was obvious, wasn't it? Only, our eyes deceived us.\nThe same is true for time. It has many uncharted pores.
6192355001503601 Heliocentrism was discovered in ancient times.
6192355001503602 Time does move strange in our town.
6192355001503603 I never claimed otherwise. I was just illustrating my belief that human perception is limited. The poverty of our mind skews much in our eyes.\nFortunately, we can overcome it.
6192355001503604 By building cathedrals?
6192355001503605 Have you noticed how many clocks there are in the Town?
6192355001503606 And a bell that tolls every hour.
6192355001503607 Yeah. All of them similar, too. A mass-produced shipment from the outside world?
6192355001503608 Same as everywhere.
6192355001503609 All of these clocks are small Cathedrals. They don't measure time; they weave it. Time coils into loops beside them. Have you noticed?\nLike a hive. A queen makes larvae. Worker bees cradle, transport, and manage them. The Cathedral produces time. The clocks distribute it.
6192355001503610 If that was true, one could bargain with time. But I'm always running short on time, always late…
6192355001503611 …Yeah. I've noticed.
6192355001503612 These clocks are the best I've ever done for our town.
6192355001503614 So you made them? You have good reason to be proud, then.
6192355001503615 Yet you could have opened a school.
6192355001505551 I came to see you. Will you stop me?
6192355001505552 The sick go to a hospital. You may curse it, but you'd still go there to care for them. That's what doctors do, isn't it?\nI'm here for my children. I'm the only protector they have left. Khan might have done it, too… but he's not with us. So I say this in his stead: you aren't needed here.
6192355001505553 I don't give a damn about your tower. I just need to make sure you're all right.
6192355001505554 The Town's children are gathering here—the healthy ones, anyway. We'll be fine here. There's no sand pest inside. \nWe'll wait on the steps until tomorrow. Whoever shows any signs of it will descend. The rest will take shelter in the Polyhedron.
6192355001505556 Why?
6192355001505557 Children love this tower, Artemy. They just <i>do.</i> So let them stay here until the end… It's close, isn't it?\nThey're so happy here… if only you could see. I'm watching them be happy. Go. Don't disturb us. You're not needed here.
6192355001505558 Fine. Have it your way. Just tell them that I… care about them.
6192355001505560 You're cold, Victoria.

6192355001506852 Artillery, Burakh. The military. This is their direct obligation—to shoot at the Town. So let them shoot its least useful part.
6192355001506853 Sure… Everyone has to play a role in the Inquisitor's plot. Right?
6192355001506854 But there are children inside!
6192355001506855 They've been evacuated. First thing the general did.\nI must give credit where it's merited—he's a remarkable individual. Especially for a military commander.
6192355001506856 A town without children… Was that your doing, too?
6192355001506862 Finally you ask a question you don't already know the answer to.
6192355001506863 Ask no questions. Trust me.
6192355001506864 I'm not afraid of anything.
6192355001506865 It's not about trust. I simply realized nothing was holding me back there anymore. I've done all I could.
6192355001506866 Indeed, I no longer am.
6192355001506867 And I'm no longer yargachin, or emshen, or… whoever else. I'm leaving my fate behind.
6192355001506868 We both did. I believe it is right. We'll make our own path from now on.\nThis is the ultimate freedom, I think: departing from the track someone has laid for you.
6192355001506869 So you're in no danger now?
6192355001506870 Actually… where did this train come from?
6192355001506871 Wow. How did I manage that?
6192355001506872 Why are you so sincere all of a sudden?
6192355001506873 I deeply respect open-minded people, unconstrained by whatever is imposed upon them. Capable of finding less obvious connections.\nIt's a skill poets have… and steppe surgeons, it seems. What's the word…?
6192355001506874 Emshen. A knower of Lines.
6192355001506917 To hell with the Tower. An hour ago, I wished to settle the score with those who sent me here, irreversibly stifling my life. Now, I don't care.\nSomething unique occurred during our conversation. Something so important I'm comfortable changing my plans. \nIt's happening to you, too. Don't deny it.
6192355001506918 All right. I've made up my mind. Let's defy fate. Let's flee.
6192355001506919 Fleeing… What's the point? What is there for me to flee to?
6192355001506920 You've become special to me, too.
6192355001506921 …You've turned my world upside down again, Artemy Burakh. A self-taught, backwoods surgeon…\nFine. I'll send three couriers with the papers to the headquarters. And I'll leave town tonight. I have that option. But only if you come with me.
6192355001506922 I have a duty… to those people who have also become special to me.
6192355001506923 You don't have a duty! You came here to conquer fate. This is how it's done.
6192355001506924 Is it, now?
6192355001506925 Do you know why I marked you among many others? You gave me the key. You showed me that people can simply disregard those who pull their strings, those who set your path for you.\nThey tell you what victory is. But it's a lie. It rings false. True victory is breaking through the walls, changing the rules of the game. \nCome on. Make up your mind.
6192355001506926 But what about the children?
6192355001506927 Wake up, Burakh. There are no children. None of this is real.
6192355001506928 But what about the Tower? What if your couriers fail to deliver the papers? The Town is in chaos…
6192355001506929 We live in a large country. Lots of places to lie low for a bit. With a mind like yours, creating a new life will be simple.
6192355001506930 Try, at least! Better than walking meekly to your execution!
6192355001506931 Why would you want me?
6192355001506932 Because I can tell that we need each other.\nNo two people could be more unlike one another. We could have an interesting life together. I can see it. You can see it, with your heart, in the Lines…
6192355001506933 Holy hell…
6192355001506934 Aglaya Lilich, commissar of the omnipotent Powers That Be, and Artemy Burakh, a scab shed from the body of a godforsaken people. A brilliant couple.
6192355001506935 I agree.
6192355001506936 Huh. I didn't expect you'd agree.
6192355001506937 I want to abandon the tracks laid down for me. Now's the time to do it. Those are the Lines I see.
6192355001506939 Out of the question.
6192355001506940 Who <i>are</i> those people behind the scenes? The ones pulling our strings, or whatever?
6192355001506941 The ones who suggested this question to you, who fed you this thought. \nIf you agree to leave with me, I'll explain while we travel. It will be a long and difficult conversation.
6192355001506942 But I need to take care of the children…
6192355001506943 Seriously? You're fine with leaving before you watch the Polyhedron fall, no matter how much you loathe it?
6192355001506944 No, Aglaya Lilich. I may be a slave, I may be someone's puppet, but I will not abandon them.
6192355001506945 Father's duty is my duty. I can't. Even if it's all over, even if they're dead or doomed, what else could I do?
6192355001506946 You'll be enslaved to the words inside your head, to the story made before you. Not even made for you, but for someone else. What for?\nEven that girl Clara knows the more we twist in the spider's web, the worse we make it… for ourselves <i>and</i> others.
6192355001506947 No. If I doom everything by doing this, so be it. But I can't abandon them… My conscience is more important to me.
6192355001506948 A spiderweb… I see. So that's what the whole "making connections" thing was about… and I was like a spider. Fine. Let's leave the Town.
6192355001506949 Flee…in what transport? Speaking of, how did you get here in the first place? It's not like you flew in on a broom, surely.
6192355001506950 Yargachin.
6192355001506951 Let me guess: "I'll only return after they restock the chocolate."
6192355001506956 Come on, stop crying. You'll see her soon, if you manage to survive…
6192355001506960 It's an open question.
6192355001506961 That's it. The Town is officially dead.
6192355001506962 They'll be back, as soon as the plague is contained.
6192355001506963 Ever? You think so?
6192355001506964 More will be born.
6192355001506965 They'll be safer elsewhere.
6192355001507351 People call us by different names… Depends if the treatment worked.
6192355001507352 Well… let us part as friends. For the first time, I say this to someone I wanted to create patterns with.
6192355001507353 What's wrong?
6192355001507356 Am I not human?
6192355001507357 I didn't mean it like that… You are.
6192355001507358 What's never happened to you before?
6192355001507359 You're trying to convince Grief we're all puppets. So you must be one of the ones who considers themselves a puppeteer.
6192355001507360 Something strange is happening to me. I could put it into words—and yet I do not have the words. It's weakness. I must purge it from my heart.
6192355001507361 You must. You're an inquisitor, after all.
6192355001507362 A wise man once said: What we first consider weakness is in fact our source of greatest strength.
6192355001507363 The words you choose don't matter. What matters is always glimpsed between them, anyway.
6192355001507364 Speak to me.
6192355001507365 What about?
6192355001507366 So you do have a heart. That's a surprise.
6192355001507367 I don't know. Just speak. Touch me with your words.
6192355001507368 I'm not inclined towards touch lately. Touching others leads to certain death, now.
6192355001507369 I don't care. I mean, no… I do care. I can't talk about it.
6192355001507370 Are you scared?
6192355001507371 We have nothing to talk about. Your master's been damaged, and she's beyond help.
6192355001507372 Which words do you wish me to touch you with?
6192355001507373 Are you ashamed of what you're doing?
6192355001507374 Have you fallen in love, somehow?
6192355001507375 You'll die soon. Doctors can feel when death's inevitable. It lurks by people's bedsides, like in that story about the doctor who made a contract with him.
6192355001507376 Perhaps… Yes, you may be right.\nEnough. This is weakness. No more. I refuse it. No means no—and this is the final word I'll speak to myself.
6192355001507377 You can say whatever you like. It won't change anything.
6192355001507378 I'm sorry, Reflection. I really, truly am.
6192355001507379 You really are alive, huh. Warm blood and a beating heart…who would have guessed.
6192355001507451 Not on a broom, no. Don't ask unnecessary questions.
6192355001507452 Flee. On a broom, or on foot, but however you do it, flee.
6192355001507453 That's an inquisitor's skill. Ending the game—not in stalemate or checkmate, but by simply getting up from the table. I'd love to do the same, if I could.
6192355001507853 We have so few places of our own—only a couple. And yet you feel the urge to impose yourself even here.\nDo you know what childhood is? It's slavery. Herders treat their cattle better than parents treat their children. They lock us up like objects, mold us like statues, and still never take us remotely seriously.
6192355001507854 See that lantern over there? I fixed that. I've earned the right to be here.
6192355001507855 Wrong. Children have many places of their own. Me, Stakh, Grief, and Gravel would sometimes vanish for weeks…
6192355001507856 Are you talking about your own family?
6192355001507857 Whatever you say.
6192355001507858 What happened to you? Why are you here and not in the Tower?
6192355001507859 Of course not. I am a ruler's son. To me, my own issues must always be of least concern. But I'm not blind. I see the others.
6192355001507860 You're a responsible young man.
6192355001507861 So what happened to you, son of a ruler?
6192355001507862 …You happened to me.
6192355001507863 Me?
6192355001507864 I'm not shifting responsibility onto you. And I have no regrets. Going to that house was the right thing to do—I've heard it even helped slow the infection somewhat…\nHowever, in your place, I'd never allow two adolescents to venture inside a hotbed of infection.
6192355001507865 Damn it! All right, let me see your pupils. And be honest with me… Are you infected?
6192355001507866 Would you look at that… I'm once again the culprit.
6192355001507867 As if you wouldn't have gone without me, anyway! At least I supervised.
6192355001507870 I don't know anything for certain anymore. How long is its incubation period? No one knows. That means I can't go back to the Polyhedron.
6192355001507871 Is that so?
6192355001507872 Several hundred of my friends live there. I'm their leader. If there is even a miniscule chance that I've contracted sand pest…\nNo. I'm not even approaching the Tower unless I know for sure.
6192355001507873 And here I thought it was magic, that Polyhedron of yours.
6192355001507874 I can examine you. Face the light and open your eyes wider…
6192355001507875 If you're sick, we'll find you some shmowder.
6192355001507877 I have medicine. A true cure for sand pest. Very little of it, but…
6192355001507878 Surely you jest? Of course it's magic. Wondrous. Inexplicable. But the people inside… they're just people, made of flesh and bone.
6192355001507879 You're like a father to your soldiers, aren't you?
6192355001507889 
6192355001507890 
6192355001507893 You're a doctor. I'll accept your help if you decide it's required. To do otherwise would be pointless arrogance.\nBut this plague is like a wild cat. Today it hides, tomorrow it ambushes. I'd rather stay here for now.
6192355001507894 But here, inside the Town, is exactly where you're in the most danger!
6192355001507895 Fair enough. Perhaps you'll make peace with Notkin, after all.
6192355001507898 …And I apologize for the way I talked to you earlier.
6192355001507899 Forget it. I can tell it's hard for you to be away from that Tower.
6192355001507900 Apology accepted.
6192355001507901 It's I who should apologize. I should have taken better care of you…
6192355001507902 Don't worry. If you're sick, I'll find a way…
6192355001507903 There's no need for dramatic proclamations... of course I'll come.
6192355001507904 They've never been yours, blockhead.
6192355001507905 Gnarl
6192355001507906 She's a mathematician.
6192355001507907 Are you two colleagues?
6192355001507908 I need to sit down… I'm dizzy.
6192355001507909 Sounds like she got you turned around.
6192355001507910 Drink some water. Do you have any on you?
6192355001507911 Huh…
6192355001507912 I can see now that I've always had that in me. I see myself with different eyes…
6192355001507913 Wow. Wonder how I'll see myself after the interrogation.
6192355001507914 Hush. Calm down now.
6192355001507915 How does she know?
6192355001507916 She's an inquisitor's daughter.
6192355001507917 An inquisitor's daughter lives in our town?
6192355001508151 Don't even try. I'm not leaving. What do I need to do, give her poultices? Then hand them over.\nI won't leave the girl, and I won't let you take her. My Grace…
6192355001508152 …He said, from the far room.
6192355001508252 
6192355001508851 We finally meet, khөөrkhen. Do what you must.
6192355001508852 It's you…
6192355001508853 Nara. Your name is Nara.
6192355001508854 It's me.
6192355001508855 I… I can't…
6192355001508856 You knew all, this time…
6192355001508857 I recognize you.
6192355001508862 A terrible tragedy. Many dead…\nI've seen this disease before. Your father did everything right. I'd give my honor and my life not to let it happen again. But since it has already come to pass, let us take advantage of this tragedy.
6192355001508863 "Take advantage"? What are you talking about, tangher?
6192355001508864 Our people withered by the year, so that the Town grew. It was built on our bones.\nNow—the other way around. The Town withers, our people endure. Time to revive the Kin.
6192355001508865 Be khara, what we need now is unity, not discord!
6192355001508870 Bayarlaa, tangher.
6192355001508871 Still—tell me. You looked for mythical bulls among the steppe. The aurochs. Is it true they're extinct?
6192355001508872 I was looking for <i>ancient</i> bulls. Odonghe said they'd heard them bellow far away.\nThey were mistaken. I walked the steppe a long time. There are no more ancient bulls. The Town devoured them, as it devours us, the Kin, Khatanghe. Don't let this loss be for nothing. Go to the Warrens.
6192355001508873 Hopefully I'll come back with good news.
6192355001508874 Be khara, you're hiding something… but I'll ask Tycheek.
6192355001508875 Shagnalda, I'm going! Tycheek's daughter Taya is there. I need to see her.
6192355001508876 I won't kill anyone. I'm not a butcher.
6192355001508877 You are a butcher. He who knows the Lines is a butcher. He who can dissect a great bull is a butcher. He who fears not blood.\nPay the price for your father's authority. It is always paid in blood.
6192355001508878 This isn't my path.
6192355001508880 I'm a doctor, not a murderer.
6192355001508881 Death is nothing. Don't overvalue human life. People only matter as parts of an udurgh.\nA person is dissolved in "people," a person is dissolved in Earth. As separate entities, they matter not at all, whether alive or dead.
6192355001508882 I don't <i>fear</i> blood. But I'll find a different way to unite our people.
6192355001508883 Fine. You've convinced me.
6192355001508884 You are exhausted, dүү khүbүүn. You need sleep. Dreams will help you sort your thoughts.\nAs for me, I leave for Olonngo. My place is there. So too will yours, one day.
6192355001508885 Be kharanab, now's not the time to rest…
6192355001508886 I'm not a bull.
6192355001508887 I still don't believe you. Be oylgono ugyb… I don't understand.
6192355001508888 How did you get here? Why are you waiting for me?
6192355001508889 I'm not here for you.
6192355001508890 Then how…
6192355001508891 Be khara, you still do not understand. You need to find the blood yourself. See it with your eyes. Touch it with your hand. Taste it with your tongue.
6192355001508892 Be kharanab—more talk of traditions! Now's not the time.
6192355001508893 All I need is the material for a cure.
6192355001508894 Tenegh… then what's the matter? You'll get it.
6192355001508895 All right. I'm going.
6192355001508896 You need to spend time in the Abattoir, Kindred. Inside.
6192355001508897 …To become respected by the Kin?
6192355001509351 Hey, stranger. Take a good look at me. Do I look <i>that</i> untrustworthy? Is my face really only good for pointing a gun at?
6192355001509352 Well, I wouldn't shake your hand.
6192355001509353 Beak
6192355001509354 Talon
6192355001509355 "Any trickle of blood seeps from Olonngo." Off limits.
6192355001509356 "Any trickle of blood seeps from Olonngo."
6192355001509357 "Olonngo"
6192355001509367 Isidor Burakh was a father to more than just you. Do you realize this?
6192355001509368 Of course. I used to have a brother.
6192355001509369 Did Stakh get to you, too? Drop it. I understood his deal already.
6192355001509370 You mean he was like a father to this whole town?
6192355001509371 Stakh is dead, if that's who you meant.
6192355001509372 You walk Isidor's path, and you're very good at it! You have extraordinary hands—light like wings. I will always be by your side, will always help you with anything.\nExcept for one thing. You're not our father.
6192355001509373 <i>You</i> come to <i>me.</i> Not the other way around. The Lines lead you.
6192355001509374 Father's will was that I take care of you. That's enough for me.
6192355001509375 I'm not trying to be.
6192355001509376 Children are warm creatures. They smell of milk; they listen eagerly to your every word. And… you tried. I can see that.\nBut your care keeps us stuck in the past. In childhood. They need someone to lead them into the future.
6192355001509377 <i>I</i> keep you in the past? How exactly? I don't ground anyone; I don't even make them bathe!
6192355001509380 Wait, what? Ah, shudher!
6192355001509388 Chainlink
6192355001509389 Well, I doubt you are.
6192355001509390 This is for you.
6192355001509391 Come on, tell me. What is it about?
6192355001509395 What are you giving me?
6192355001509396 The anarchist was executed. On her body, we've found a document. See here: "I, Lara Ravel, conceived the murder of General Block alone. No one knew of my plans. If anyone called Rubin, Burakh, or Filin claims to be my accomplice, disregard them. I've done it myself."
6192355001509397 Lara! Why... no, wait... "executed"?
6192355001509398 What have you done to her, you pieces of shit?!
6192355001509399 Oh Gravel, what have you done...
6192355001509400 She came here. She produced a weapon. We don't take kindly to anarchists.
6192355001509401 No... No, no, no...
6192355001509402 Where's the body...?
6192355001509651 
6192355001509652 
6192355001509653 
6192355001509654 
6192355001509655 You're too late, doctor. Should have come two weeks ago, when Uncle Simon was still alive. Now, nothing can be fixed.
6192355001509656 Simon was old.
6192355001509663 Me? A local milkwoman.
6192355001509664 Yeah, sure.
6192355001510151 To hell with those squaddies. They didn't let me near the Station, so I couldn't even say goodbye! I just wanted one last look at the kids. Just for that, they damn near shot me!
6192355001510153 You look healthy. That's what matters.
6192355001510154 You'll meet them again.
6192355001510157 Was one of yours there?
6192355001510158 Not my children—I'm a teacher. Organized classes… You know we lack a proper school, but they did show up. They worked hard, even…
6192355001510159 I'm sorry.
6192355001510162 Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
6192355001510164 Is there any trust left at all in this town?
6192355001510165 What kids?
6192355001510166 Haven't you heard? They've been evacuated. At least they're safe…\nIt's how it should be. When a ship sinks, the lifeboats go to the women and children first. You just have to hope there's enough space for them.
6192355001510167 Fair enough.
6192355001510554 
6192355001510555 
6192355001510556 
6192355001510557

6192355001510559 
6192355001510560 
6192355001510561 
6192355001510562 Aide
6192355001510563 Are you Burakh? Filin? Rubin?
6192355001510564 I'm Burakh.
6192355001510963 Khyyr…
6192355001510964 Khyyr… Yes, a grave. A tomb. But what do you mean?
6192355001510965 Noukherne… Say more!
6192355001510966 Byy alysh…
6192355001510967 "Do not kill." Whom?
6192355001510968 Baygalday, don't be silent…
6192355001510969 .....
6192355001510970 Then again, who cares what you say… Here it is, the scariest day of my life.
6192355001510971 You haven't let me down. Bayarlaa, Kindred.
6192355001511953 I thought we had become best friends! But the moment I needed you, you vanished! Why? Were you scared of my knife?
6192355001511957 Look who's back! Where have you been, stranger?
6192355001511958 .      .      ..
6192355001511959 Don't leave me again, all right? Or I'll have to tether you.
6192355001511960 All right, all right. Who's a good bull? I'm not mad. You just left at a bad time.
6192355001511961 ... ..
6192355001511962 If you knew what went on here, you wouldn't have come back. Or is that exactly the reason you did?
6192355001511963 I'd run off too, if I could… but, not yet.
6192355001511964 Got anything to say?
6192355001512051 I don't feel too good. My eyes are burning, like I'm looking at hellfire. So, time to say goodbye, then? You know… just in case.
6192355001512052 Remember how we first met? By Father's house…
6192355001512053 Murky dropped by. Brought a sack of herbs. I guess she wanted to make a wreath, but… well, the only wreaths we need now would be memorial.
6192355001512054 "Funeral." It's "funeral wreaths" and "memorial candles."
6192355001512055 Memorial wreaths, my ass! No one's dying on my watch.
6192355001512056 Well, can't deny it anymore—I did think you were it, back then. The murderer, I mean…
6192355001512057 You wolfling…
6192355001512058 And we've done a great job! Now all you need is to brew the potions… right? Make some more?
6192355001512059 I will. Promise.
6192355001512060 There'll be another time for goodbyes… Remember how you wanted to rob that shop? For a good cause?
6192355001512061 It was a bad idea… We should have switched. I should have done the talking, and you, the robbing… I was too slow…
6192355001512062 Patrolmen would have had a field trip with <i>that</i> combination.
6192355001512063 But I wasn't such a villain after all.
6192355001512065 You just… you… help the others first, all right? I can bear it. The cauldron is close by. Working on me won't take long.
6192355001512066 I know better how to handle this.
6192355001512067 Quiet, you martyr. Let me think.
6192355001512068 I respect your attitude. Now hush and let me examine you.
6192355001512069 Uh huh. You were on the verge of spanking me. "That's a lesson for you! Respect the law!" Like the law's ever done anything respectable.
6192355001512070 Is that really your biggest concern now…?
6192355001512071 …
6192355001512074 If only I had enough raw material to make medicine for everyone!
6192355001512075 That's all right. We'll do plenty of jobs in the future.
6192355001512076 You didn't like Murky at first, remember? Were all so cranky…
6192355001512351 Me? Cranky? No way!\nIt's different. You're never home, so I had to run the household. I was just… concerned. Trying to find food for us both…
6192355001512352 I'll cure you all, and we'll move into a normal house. We'll have a normal life…
6192355001512353 It's all for the best, pal. As it will be. Everything'll be all right, you'll see.
6192355001512354 Fair enough. Thank you for that.
6192355001512355 No. No goodbyes. We've just met, and now you want to say goodbye?
6192355001512356 I'm sorry, kid. Just be patient a little while longer.
6192355001512359 Hello. I recognize you. I can feel you though this cloth. You're… you. Burakh's son. No… just Burakh. Your name is Artemy, I remember. It doesn't matter that you're a son… I misspoke… You're on your own… right? Right. On your own.\nI… I want to ask something of you.
6192355001512360 I'll cure you.
6192355001512361 Anything.
6192355001512362 I'll try. And… thank you for saying this.
6192355001512363 This architect… he's an artist… and he's… he's… he's my new friend! And I… I don't want him to die.\nBut he refuses to leave, to leave me alone. Let… Let him… take him away from here! Away from me!
6192355001512364 You'll live. You hear me? You'll live!
6192355001512365 I know what you want to ask. But Stamatin won't leave.
6192355001512370 That idiot… That moron…
6192355001512371 You don't understand. Peter needs help. Today is the last day.
6192355001512372 Does he talk to you like Father did?
6192355001512373 Peter is dead, but you're still alive. I want to take care of you first.
6192355001512374 I've already failed him once.
6192355001512377 You're the only one I have left. Take this key. Give it to Andrey—today. He'll understand.
6192355001512378 Hand it over.
6192355001512379 And you know what… let's not say goodbye, all right? No one ever truly leaves, you know.
6192355001512383 I will.
6192355001512384 All right.
6192355001512385 He'll get sick… It's dangerous for him here! Dangerous to be with me…
6192355001512386 Maybe he grew attached to you? He won't leave you.
6192355001512388 We won't say goodbye. But for another reason.
6192355001512389 Don't you dare. People need you here—the living and the dead.
6192355001512390 Yes. And I want to do something good. While there's still anything of him left… and of me.
6192355001512391 Tell me.
6192355001512392 I'll give him a protective pill.
6192355001512393 I'm sorry.
6192355001512751 Clothes
6192355001512851 Blood-Kin
6192355001513051 You're a funny creature…
6192355001513064 "Thou shalt not fear the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;\nNor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday."\nRemember the psalm? I've always been curious why the pestilence "walks" there. Like it's a living creature…
6192355001513065 No, I don't. I'm not a psalm person.
6192355001513066 Why are you reciting psalms?
6192355001513067 Well, it's supposed to be a protective chant. From pestilence… and also, "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee."
6192355001513068 Oh, it shall, whether you pray or not.
6192355001513069 Stop fretting. It won't touch you. You drink like a fish, and liquid courage offers good protection…
6192355001513070 I'm not praying for myself, blockhead. It's for her.
6192355001513071 For who?
6192355001513072 Perhaps there is a reason.
6192355001513073 Little girls? I'm not sure. Raspberries and earthworms, I believe, although you need to chew them yourself first.
6192355001513074 Really…?
6192355001513075 No, you idiot! Bread, meat, milk, vegetables! Whatever you have…
6192355001513078 Sure.
6192355001513079 To feed her normally?
6192355001513080 To give her a separate room?
6192355001513081 No! \nWhy do we keep insisting that buildings have to go upwards? I want to create a Great Pit, Burakh! Get it? Like a Polyhedron, but <i>down,</i> not up!
6192355001513082 Peter… Get some sleep.
6192355001513083 That's… uh… genius?
6192355001513084 Pits are frowned upon around here, don't you know? Even regular ones.
6192355001513085 Wait! The Polyhedron defied the law of gravity—so the Pit would completely defy our perception of space! Our understanding of up and down! Do you get it? Do you?
6192355001513086 I don't.
6192355001513087 Peter. You need to get some sleep. I mean it. Tomorrow, when your head is clearer, you'll draw that pit of yours.
6192355001513088 You've just invented humanity's mass grave. Is that it?
6192355001513089 A pit! A genius pit…
6192355001513090 So that's how you and Grace connected…
6192355001513091 Peter, I'll take her from you in a couple of days. Got it?
6192355001513092 Have some sleep. You'll dream of that pit of yours.
6192355001513120 Actually, he's the one who's supposed to take care of you.
6192355001513121 I'll take you in… later. When this is all over.
6192355001513122 What?
6192355001513123 The plague.
6192355001513124 Everything.
6192355001513125 It won't ever be over. But that's okay. It's all okay.
6192355001513126 This Peter… he doesn't hurt you in any way, does he?
6192355001513127 Then stay here for now… and stay alive. Both of you.
6192355001513128 I'll take you in when the time comes.
6192355001513129 No. I'm your family.
6192355001513132 Just wait here a little while longer… All right?
6192355001513355 Shall we sing a song together?
6192355001513551 You've done a great deed, Kindred. "Tom naymaa," the elders would have said. "A deed," I will say.\nAnd you've done it all on your own.
6192355001513552 Yes. I have done it on my own.
6192355001513553 I'm sorry I haven't reported to you. Tycheek's dead…
6192355001513554 They demanded Vlad Olgimsky. And then I realized…
6192355001513555 I had to kill.
6192355001513556 Silence, Kindred.\nYou've done well. It's not the herder's place to report to cattle.
6192355001513557 You aren't cattle, Kindred! You're Father's friend. And my senior.
6192355001513558 …
6192355001513559 I wanted Isidor's son—little Artemy—to take his place among the Kin. The place of a man who decides his own path.\nYour father was always wilful. He lived in the Town. Took a non-Khatangher as a wife. Made friends with madmen from Bridge Square.\nI advised him, and I accepted the slander, so that he could be free in his decisions. Now you take his place.
6192355001513560 I just didn't have time to drop by, that's all!
6192355001513561 I'm glad you approve of my actions.
6192355001513564 What about Olonngo's blood…?
6192355001513565 There will be blood. Later.
6192355001513566 Fine. I'm waiting, Kindred.
6192355001513567 Thank you.
6192355001513568 You chose the path of strength, Kindred. I respect that.
6192355001513569 Yes. I chose the path of strength.
6192355001513570 Not sure it's worthy of respect…
6192355001513571 Everyone respects strength.
6192355001513572 Fine.
6192355001513573 What matters is that the people are free now.

6192355001513869 No. No tales today. Stay quiet, I'll bring you a cure.
6192355001513870 Tell me a scary one. The one where we stayed in that house of stone and died.
6192355001513871 It's a sad tale. Thank heavens it's just a tale.
6192355001513872 Tell me how we all could have lived in Shekhen…
6192355001513873 Well… there once was a girl… Shudkher! I can't, little one. I'm no good at inventing such tales…
6192355001513874 Then stay with me a bit here, ontokho khelekhe. Tell me a tale. It'll ease my pain a bit if you do… Be naydamtay bolokho…
6192355001513875 Yamar yuumen toukhai? What kind of tale would you like?
6192355001513951 I don't know, either! Khan left them. But why? Did they force him out?
6192355001513952 Where did he go?
6192355001513953 To the Nutshell, of course!\nOur lot said he's sitting there, all shut in and refusing to come out. Aren't you interested in what happened? You're so boring!
6192355001513954 Hm… I <i>am</i> interested.
6192355001513958 Remind me, the Dogheads are…?
6192355001513961 You've got enough fun for two, though.
6192355001513965 I don't feel so good, doctor. Maybe you got a pill or something?\nYou're… a good man. All of us agree. That's what they say, "He's a decent guy, a good guy. His heart's in the right place." But is it, Burakh?
6192355001513966 Remember that trial of yours?
6192355001513967 How could we forget. You offered fair judgment back then.\nWe threw Lika in the well… and he deserved it. He poisoned our dogs, so he deserved a dog's death. Earth is the fairest of judges, as our friend Namar likes to say…
6192355001513971 I'm sorry about Patches, boy. I couldn't figure out what to do with this pest. Got confused. Forgive me.
6192355001513972 I guess he deserved it.
6192355001513973 You've dragged yourself from the other side once, and you'll do it again. You're a stubborn kid.
6192355001513974 Well! Lots of things have happened…\nHey, how's Khan doing? Tell him I got no grudges… He's a decent guy.
6192355001513975 He is. That's why he's sick, too…
6192355001513976 I'm sorry, friend. I'll take care of Jester somehow.
6192355001513977 Well… it can't be helped now, can it? That big-city asshole got you confused too, remember? But he turned out to be a decent guy too in the end.\nWe all deserve one another.
6192355001513978 Are you mad at me?
6192355001513979 Remember your trial? How you wanted to execute Lika? Some inquisitors…
6192355001513985 Stop the drama. You're a fighter. I'll have you up and running in no time.
6192355001513987 Patches.
6192355001513988 
6192355001514051 Your Grief's six feet under! Now it's Barley's turn to call the shots.\nDidn't you know? Aren't you supposed to be the wise healer round here? Some friend to him you were, eh?
6192355001514052 Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.
6192355001514053 …I knew.
6192355001514054 Fair enough.
6192355001514055 Whoa. "Your" Grace? Fatherly instincts kicking in?
6192355001514060 Like you have a choice… You two belong together now. Try to take care of each other.
6192355001514063 She's like a gulp of fresh water, old boy. She sings lullabies to my paintings. Lullabies! They're alive to her. Or dead… but they're people. People! Do you understand? \nI can almost stand looking at them without nausea now, too…
6192355001514064 So you <i>do</i> know what water is?
6192355001514065 It's because she's a child.
6192355001514068 
6192355001514079 Don't you shame me! I'm afraid, yes. Afraid of looking at her, at that rotten rag instead of a face. Afraid of how she's wheezing. Standing there stock-still. Why do they always stand? She won't sit or lie down…\nBut don't you dare assume. I'll do… whatever it is I need to do. Just let me find my courage…
6192355001514080 Who knew you'd turn out to be so loyal.
6192355001514082 Why do you think we care what happens you?
6192355001514083 I've forgotten that children are cruel and fearless.
6192355001514084 This place is dangerous.
6192355001514085 How are you special?
6192355001514086 We're from the inside. You won't understand. We can barely wrap our heads around it ourselves.
6192355001514087 From the inside? Why did you come out, then?
6192355001514090 If you don't care about me, think about yourselves, at least! This area is infected! Shoo!
6192355001514094 If it falls, it <i>will</i> be because of you.
6192355001514095 I'm not <i>that</i> big.
6192355001514096 You're not afraid of anything, are you, creepy kids?
6192355001514097 Fine. To hell with you.
6192355001514098 …Well, all right, go. You'll only see stairs and catwalks anyway.
6192355001514099 Thanks, I guess.
6192355001514100 As opposed to…?
6192355001514101 Sounds ominous…
6192355001514102 What a rude question. Where did <i>you</i> get <i>yours?</i>
6192355001514103 I'm human.
6192355001514104 But last time I saw you, you were floating! Or was that a different rat?
6192355001514105 Burakh. When an actor on stage gets a bullet through their head, do you also pester them about how they managed to cure that when you meet them the day after? No. You don't even ask that yourself. You die, stand back up, dust yourself off, and keep on going.\nThese are just legs.
6192355001514106 So you're an actor?
6192355001514108 This tumor is malignant.
6192355001514109 I can see that.
6192355001514110 I know you. You aren't just any rat. You're a theatrical rat.
6192355001514111 But…you were different before. You stood on your own legs. I even thought you might just be a kid in a mask, or a little person.
6192355001514112 That was a different creature. Not me.
6192355001514113 Huh… then, what are you?
6192355001514114 So many rats running around these days…
6192355001514115 Like hell! I won't let you have them!
6192355001514116 Yes… You are a wonder, too. "Plague, monsters, and wonders." Such is our tragedy.
6192355001514117 Don't you? How many children are holed up in your house? How many did you promise to take in at some point? How many did you consider protecting?
6192355001514118 Like I wanted to! It would be so much easier on my own…
6192355001514119 There's a <i>plague,</i> if you haven't noticed. Is there any place safer than a doctor's house?
6192355001514120 What are you getting at?
6192355001514121 So if you weren't a doctor, you wouldn't care about us?
6192355001514122 I <i>am</i> a doctor. No point in "ifs."
6192355001514123 Well… who knows. What are you getting at?
6192355001514124 So you're suggesting I abandon you all to the whims of fate?
6192355001514133 Scattered thoughts and anxieties pop into my head… because we're connected, you and I. \nI'm sorry you have to hear them sometimes… That's my mother awakening inside me. I can't help it. Because I see you.
6192355001514134 It's all right. Useful, even.
6192355001514135 I accept your apology. But don't do it again.
6192355001514136 I had a dream yesterday. All our children lay on the ground, and a white flower grew from each of their heads. You'd water them when they were sad, and sometimes picked leaves from them for your potions.\nAnd then a cart ran over them all, and its wheels ground them to dust.
6192355001514137 Yeah. I've been having uncanny dreams lately too. I'm exhausted…
6192355001514138 …They'll soon die and turn to soil?
6192355001514139 …Someone else is coming to the Town? Death, in an iron cart?
6192355001514140 …I'm not doing enough for them?
6192355001514151 "I suggest we burn TL with honor. I feel we're not gonna return."
6192355001514152 "I gave all my stashes away to the birds. You do that too. They need it more now."
6192355001514153 "I dont need a town without Riska."
6192355001514154 "IF WE STЯIKE THEY WOИT TAKE US ANYWHEЯE!!!"
6192355001514155 "Instruction: choose four favorite things, take them with you, hide the rest under boards rocks. Barter one of your favorites to a friend."
6192355001514156 "My secret will is: I leave everything to the Big Tree. If you find any of my shit, bring it there. Just don’t take anything for yourself!"
6192355001514157 "Don't take it away. It wants to stay right here."

6192355001515152 Ugh! Here we go again.
6192355001515153 I'm done. I'm done, you hear me? Get a hold of yourself!
6192355001515451 Unacceptable! I'm saying this as a Mother Superior! Ontokho khelekhe.
6192355001515452 Fine. What kind of tale do you want to hear?
6192355001515751 
6192355001515752 
6192355001515753 
6192355001515754 
6192355001515755 
6192355001515756 
6192355001515757 
6192355001515758 
6192355001515851 The Khatanghe are making me a personal yurt, all mine! It'll be all colorful, with a shanyrak on top. Yag iim baina! All Shekhen will see me!\nAnd you know what? You don't have the same!
6192355001515852 Teasing me, Mother?
6192355001515853 Do share! I'd sell my soul for sweet talh…
6192355001515854 Living with you? That's a bold proposal…
6192355001515855 That'll make you a true Mother Superior.
6192355001515857 You're keeping everyone busy, then. Good job.
6192355001515858 Like I could compare to you!
6192355001515859 You have so many ideas… I can tell you're a serious person from a mile away.
6192355001515951 …How could she become a dead man's ward?
6192355001515952 …A dead man? But—but he came in person…\nOh. I see. It must have been Peter's brother. They're twins…
6192355001515953 Twins or not, they're hard to mistake for one another.
6192355001515954 It's not that important. What matters is if the girl's looked after.
6192355001515955 In any case, Grace lives at Peter Stamatin's place now. It's a tall, sturdy building with thick walls and snug window-frames. It offers good protection from plague and bad weather. That's what matters.
6192355001515956 Nothing offers good protection from plague.
6192355001515957 You're right. We needed to minimize her contact with corpses. That was… potentially dangerous.
6192355001515958 You're all insane…
6192355001515959 I thought you and Peter became friends. I kind of expected you'd stay with him.
6192355001515960 So did I… but Mother said I can't. He forgets about me sometimes. And no one brings him milk and bread, for some reason…
6192355001515961 Fair enough. But you can visit him sometimes.
6192355001515962 She shouldn't have said that…
6192355001516051 
6192355001516152 It's a beautiful tale. But I don't know it…
6192355001516153 And my throat hurts, too… Ankhadaghaa aman boloshohon… Do you have a pill that makes it less painful to swallow?
6192355001516157 I'll cure you, little one. I swear…
6192355001516159 I don't remember how it goes… It hurts. How does it go?
6192355001516160 I don't remember either…
6192355001516163 Is there really such a tale?
6192355001516751 <i>The beige thread has snapped.</i>
6192355001516752 <i>The Shelter smells of gunpowder. Rusty iron. Snowmelt by a brick wall. Don't be late this time.</i>
6192355001516753 <i>Hey… If you hear this echo of me… Lara…</i>
6192355001516754 <i>An echo… My final echo… Aglaya…</i>
6192355001516755 <i>The beige thread has snapped.</i>
6192355001516851  
6192355001516852  
6192355001517051 I'm all three. What is it?
6192355001517551 Bury me somewhere 'round those rocks. All right? I want to grow into swevery. It'll be pretty…
6192355001517552 Remember how you taught me to pick herbs?
6192355001517553 You won't die. You hear? You hear me?
6192355001517554 Yeah…
6192355001517555 I know. You're about to say you don't need me and there's nothing about me to love.
6192355001517556 I won't say that… I loved you the moment I saw you. Yeah.
6192355001517557 Listen to me! I saved you from the sand pest once, and I'll do it again. Just wait a little.
6192355001517558 Forgive me, kiddo…
6192355001517562 Forgive me, kiddo. I know I can't save you all. You're right. You don't need me, and there's nothing about me to love.
6192355001517563 But I am. We've failed to connect, I'm afraid, and it doesn't look like we'll get a chance. I may even regret it somewhat.
6192355001517564 We connected well enough in the House of Death.
6192355001517565 Are you unhappy I failed to get along with your sister?
6192355001517566 I was hoping that magic lantern over there would warm you a bit. I fixed it, you know.
6192355001517567 I understand we're only adolescent kids. Hot-headed, maybe. But I still can't understand your reasons. I never would have done what you did.
6192355001517568 Perhaps you'll understand someday.
6192355001517569 I will not discuss my family with you.
6192355001517570 Fair enough. Although, I'd like to ask you a thing or two about Simon someday…
6192355001517571 Thank you. Now fix the infected people—someone, anyone. I'm not asking for myself, but for my friends.
6192355001517572 The words of a young leader…
6192355001517575 I regret it too. Although, our fathers managed it. Perhaps we also had a chance… Who knows.
6192355001517576 Well, if we stop chatting and you try to do something, there is a chance it might happen. In theory.
6192355001517577 Ah, the Kains…
6192355001517578 I'll try.
6192355001517579 You and Notkin did everything yourselves. Now how do you plan to survive?
6192355001517580 As you wish.
6192355001517651 Aren't you the kid I first met in a twyrine den?
6192355001517652 So it was <i>me</i> who goaded <i>you</i> into it? Are you shameless enough to say that with a straight face?
6192355001517653 That's a very mature line of thinking.
6192355001517654 You were so worried about safety… but now you're back. Changed your mind?
6192355001517655 Dankovsky said I was healthy.
6192355001517656 You do look healthy.
6192355001517657 Unless you've contracted the infection on your way here.
6192355001517658 They aren't here. Because of <i>you.</i>
6192355001517659 Yes.
6192355001517660 Capella is alive. And I won't let her die.
6192355001517661 No.
6192355001517662 Well, you're one hell of a judge…
6192355001517663 Go away. We don't <i>need</i> you. You can't save anyone.
6192355001517664 We'll see about that.
6192355001517665 True. I can't.
6192355001517666 No one can save anyone.
6192355001517751 Ishka
6192355001517752 Khan's gone. Capella's gone.
6192355001517753 I know…
6192355001518552 It will go well. Everything in little Taya's life will go well. I promise.
6192355001518554  
6192355001518555  
6192355001518557  
6192355001518558  
6192355001518559 You know what my fingers tell me? "Come, we need you, Mother." I've been here for a long time. If they call for me, I'll go! 'Cause they're calling. I'm Mother, I need to care for them… Khyygedi be oshokho.
6192355001518560 Hush, little one. Be patient, like the brave girl you are.
6192355001518562 You're not going anywhere, dүү basaghan. I won't let you.
6192355001518566 <i>Barbaaday, I've found a bull…</i> Come on, you need to fold your fingers as I speak! Fold your thumb.
6192355001518567 Here. Folded.
6192355001518568 I don't know this song…
6192355001518651 Isidor Ghazar
6192355001518851 "To the purson from the very very far future: Pleaze remembur me. Your Neela."
6192355001518853 Lucky Find
6192355001519471 Yeah, I know… I have an ear for music, but the voice, it could use work.
6192355001519472 I guess you're right. Now isn't the time for merry songs.
6192355001519473 .....
6192355001519474 I hope you're not about to talk just yet. I guess I should give you a name?
6192355001519479 ..... 
6192355001519480 I'll call you Noukher. "Partner." So that you won't let me down, khayaala.
6192355001519481 Duugai. "Silent." I hope you remain such.
6192355001519483 Mounkhe, that's what I'll call you. "Eternity."
6192355001519484 .. ..
6192355001519485 Everyone I'm close with has gone silent. You do the same, Duugai.
6192355001519486 
6192355001519487 
6192355001519490 Measly
6192355001519653 .......
6192355001519654 Yes. It suits you.
6192355001519655 Noukher, Partner
6192355001519656 Duugai, the Silent
6192355001519657 Mounkhe, Eternity
6192355001519658 No. It's not right to impose a name upon someone. Perhaps you want to introduce yourself…?
6192355001519660 "The plague game," my ass…
6192355001519895 I wonder how you think to stop me.
6192355001519896 I have a weapon against you.
6192355001519897 Why do you do it? Why the kids…?
6192355001519898 What do you mean, "overcome death"? You <i>are</i> death!
6192355001519899 Untrue! I am not the same as death. I am but a test of menfolk's ken and prowess to overcome their bounds. And of all known bounds, death is the greatest tangle.\nThat you will die is naught but a belief… Worms, halfmen, so far from overmen!
6192355001519900 I won't let you experiment on us like that.
6192355001519901 What makes you think the kids want this transformation?
6192355001519902 They do! And if they don't, they will. That is the path your father set for them. That's why your "list" bears their names. The Town's future. The yeast to make it rise. 
6192355001519903 I won't let you have them.
6192355001519904 I am both fiend and wonder, true.\nStop, Burakh. You can't bring them back. It is beyond your power. You know not what I am; so how can you stop my reach? You can't guard them. You can't stop this.
6192355001519905 Even children managed to make a cure for you. Five years ago. "Schmowders…"
6192355001519906 What tidings?
6192355001519907 Block had all the young ones taken away. They've been crammed into a train and sent away while you daydreamed.\nFew are left. Your wards… My wards, now. The Town that used to be ruled by children has been left childless.\nWhat a thought…
6192355001519908 So mine are the last…
6192355001519909 No, wonder-creature. They are mine.
6192355001519910 A town with no future. This is it, then.
6192355001519911 Good to see you, Burakh. How are the rest of our lot…?
6192355001519912 Hello, chief. How are you? Holding it together?
6192355001519913 Yeah… living in a cellar isn't particularly fun. But neither is living in a train car.
6192355001519914 I'm glad I stayed here.
6192355001519915 You belong here. I knew it the moment I saw you.
6192355001520351 The outside world has finally made itself busy with solving our town's fate. What does this mean for me?
6192355001520352 An inquisitor arrived to the Town. She wants to see me. I've nothing to show her, but hiding is not an option.
6192355001520353 An inquisitor arrived to the Town. She wants to see me. I know what to show her.
6192355001520354 As usual, I act first and think later. I've made a panacea. But from what? What blood was that? <i>Whose</i> blood was that?\n\nTo cure the Town, I'll need to figure that out.
6192355001520356 We have a cure. It cost Rubin his life.\n\n…So now he won't be able to tell me what he made it from. How can I make more? I need an advice from someone well-versed in blood.
6192355001523951 Odongh
6192355001523952 Talked to them already.
6192355001523953 Simple townsfolk know more than it seems. If I'm unsure what to do, I should talk to them. 
6192355001523954 
6192355001523955 
6192355001523956 They allowed me on the Polyhedron… Missing the opportunity would be a waste.
6192355001523957 
6192355001523958 
6192355001523959 The world is very beautiful indeed.
6192355001523967 Where do I find Khan?
6192355001523970 ...
6192355001523971 She lives at Peter Stamatin's place.
6192355001523972 What about Khan?
6192355001523973 He's in the Nutshell.
6192355001523974 What about Grace?
6192355001523975 I see... thanks.
6192355001523976 Thank you.
6192355001523977 Of course…
6192355001523978 …Something's wrong with me. I can't raise my arms for some reason! What's going on?
6192355001523980 …What it is?
6192355001523981 I'm sorry…
6192355001523982 That's because I… in the Theatre… ah, forget it.
6192355001523983 You'll sing a different tune if you get infected… God forbid.
6192355001523984 This panic is tearing the Town apart! Can't you see what it brings us to?
6192355001523985 What?
6192355001523986 People burning each other!
6192355001523987 Mistress Katerina taught us the only path to understanding the self is through suffering. We witness the people's interpretation of her words.\nThey're not trying to kill those infected, you know. No… the hope is that pain and fire would cleanse them, somehow. Dark Age hysteria…
6192355001523988 Stop trying to blame everything on the Mistresses. Think for yourself!
6192355001523995 More fantasies. People can't even lose their mind right in this town…
6192355001523996 Sister Steppe holds some herbs in her bosom. Others, she grants to us. Then there are special herbs, the ones in the marble nest itself.
6192355001523997 In the "marble nest"?
6192355001523998 "Sister Steppe"? I thought it was perceived as a mother.
6192355001523999 Mother to you. Sister to me.
6192355001524000 So where does your sister keep the special herbs?
6192355001524001 In the Town.\nWhite whip is a bitter herb. It splits open the ground in infected districts.\nAshen swish grows wherever swishing is heard, like the singing of sharpened knives. It can be found in districts where blood is shed.
6192355001524002 Huh. Why is that?
6192355001524003 That's useful information. Thank you.
6192355001524004 Herbs are people, too. Each has a different taste.
6192355001524005 They do taste different.
6192355001524006 Thank you for the advice, friend.
6192355001524007 She's dancing by the cemetery today.
6192355001524008 Who?
6192355001524009 Your bride.
6192355001524010 I don't have a bride.
6192355001524011 My bride… You mean the strange girl that follows me around?
6192355001524012 She's dancing by the cemetery today.
6192355001524013 …Can you at least tell me who she is?
6192355001524014 What does this mean for me?
6192355001524015 She's an Herb Bride. You're a butcher. You know the rest.
6192355001524016 No! I don't…
6192355001524017 I'm not a butcher. I'm a surgeon.
6192355001524018 She's dancing by the cemetery today.
6192355001524019 Throwing sacks into the Gullet? Curious.
6192355001524020 But that's no reason to arrest her! She's here on official business.
6192355001524022 A bow to you, emshen. A bow, yargachin. You see the Lines far ahead; we only see them close. Earth tells us that Burakh's Line will lead him to great wrath soon. You will face a trial.\nTo help, we offer you a gift: our silence.
6192355001524023 What trial?
6192355001524024 Silence? How will your silence be of help to me?
6192355001524025 Are you testing me? You already know: the Lines are the art of hearing. Hearing the cavities within solid bodies; hearing the points where flesh longs to give in; hearing where <i>the world</i> longs to give in.\nYou're a hearer. Murmurs and commotion distract you. So we fall silent.
6192355001524026 Oh, come on. It's the opposite. I need your advice…
6192355001524027 You know that better than me, yargachin. Isn't there enough pain in your life?
6192355001524028 I know nothing.
6192355001524029 But how will your silence help?
6192355001524030 You need no advice from the crowd, or the murmuring of passers.\nListen to your heart, emshen. Listen to whoever is important. The Kin will no longer speak to you in the streets.
6192355001524032 I hope you reconsider.
6192355001524033 Time has become denser, somehow. Can you feel it?
6192355001524034 Exhaustion makes everything a blur.
6192355001524035 Yeah! It's like it moves faster now. You've noticed it, too?
6192355001524036 You can tell. Where does time come from? The Cathedral makes it. That's why it's always been empty. No need to crowd the place; time can only move on freely when it's empty.\nAnd she's sitting there like a spider. Must have broken something.
6192355001524037 Not "something," but someone. Half the people around… The bitch.
6192355001524038 If she's broken something, it would have been on purpose, believe me.
6192355001524039 ............
6192355001524040 Yes, Khatangher. Do it.
6192355001524041 No, it's a bad idea.
6192355001524042 .........?
6192355001524043 Sure. I understand.
6192355001524044 ............
6192355001524045 Bayarlaa, Khatangher.
6192355001524046 .......
6192355001524047 ........
6192355001525151 You know… I had a dream.\nI saw that longneck once, the one your doll is shaped like… It does exist. I tried to track it, slept in the steppe… Everyone I told about it laughed at me…\nBut I have seen it! Honestly! It's the last vampire, a shabnak-adyg…
6192355001525152 They do exist. Earth makes them from clay and bones… but they're not evil.
6192355001525153 We're here to see you… Stop it, Stakh!
6192355001525154 Yeah… I fell asleep here. I'm exhausted…
6192355001525155 How did you find me? Did you wait long?
6192355001525156 She dragged me here. Says you're not guilty. But you are!
6192355001525157 Are you off your rocker? What of?
6192355001525158 I'll be damned… you shaved your head. Preparing to become a monk? Or a soldier?
6192355001525159 Really?
6192355001525160 Really.
6192355001525161 I've seen them, too. So it wasn't the last… I hope. We'll find more. You'll see them with your own eyes!
6192355001525162 I believe you.
6192355001525163 They were all taken away from me… on a train car. Everyone under my wing. The future of the Town.
6192355001525164 I know.
6192355001525165 Take care of Khan. He's in the Nutshell.
6192355001525166 I know.
6192355001525167 Is there anything else you can do? Anything at all?
6192355001525168 It's not over yet. I'll think of something.
6192355001525169 Thank you. I'll check up on him.
6192355001525170 …Your subjects.
6192355001525171 No. Not my subjects. My children. They would have remained my children even as they'd grown up…
6192355001525172 So you've become a Mistress after all.
6192355001525173 You care about him a lot.
6192355001525174 Very much so.
6192355001525175 Do you love him?
6192355001525176 No. Not yet.
6192355001525177 Does he love you?
6192355001525178 I don't know. And truly, I don't care. You wouldn't understand. But we must be together.
6192355001525179 …For the good of the Town.
6192355001525180 Dynastic marriages…
6192355001525181 I see. Although… no, to be honest, I don't understand.
6192355001525182 He'll live. I promise.
6192355001525183 They'll return. Nothing is over, do you hear me? This is just the beginning!
6192355001525184 That's why I came, Victoria… to apologize. To you all…
6192355001525185 I'll get more of… that thing the panacea's made from. You'll all get better. I just need time.
6192355001525186 Please take care of my children… if any are still left in the Town, if any are still alive. Someone must be—I can tell! But my senses are clouded by pain… I can barely see.\nGod, it hurts so much… so much…
6192355001525187 I will. Don't worry. Take care of yourself for now. And hold on…
6192355001525188 I'm sorry I failed you.
6192355001525223 Farewell.
6192355001525224 You came because you sensed me thinking of you. Inadvertently, I touched you with my thoughts. And it isn't the first time…
6192355001525225 Why?
6192355001525226 Indeed it isn't.
6192355001525231 What else do you see? Tell me now, please, instead of barging into my head.
6192355001525232 I see that you and I have different paths. You are about to do something terrible—and destroy all the children.
6192355001525233 How so?
6192355001525234 You're seeing it wrong.
6192355001525235 Actually, you're right. Death is coming to our town in an iron cart. Precisely.\nSo you see these dreams, too?
6192355001525236 Death came to our town a week ago.
6192355001525237 You thought you were the only one? Mistress…
6192355001525238 Yes. They need help. Mine, not yours.
6192355001525239 Go home, girl. And take the others with you. It's safe there.
6192355001525240 I'm taking them from you. The ones you took care of. I'll do it now. And I'll do it better.
6192355001525241 "Taking them"? What do you mean?
6192355001525242 You're one of the children in my care. Go home.
6192355001525248 You can't look after them as I do. They'll die if they remain your wards. Because you're still so far from understanding. You can't sense the Town as I do.\nI'm taking them from you.
6192355001525249 You're in danger too! Irresponsible girl… You'll be the first to die!
6192355001525250 Wait. Let's not argue, or we'll make a mess… Can you explain this all to me, in more detail?
6192355001526251 Maybe you'll lead them—one day. But right now, you're an adolescent girl, Victoria! How old are you, like fifteen?
6192355001526253 No. Even if I die, I'll still linger… in them. In you all. Even in you yourself. I have seen that, too.
6192355001526254 Strange… So have I.
6192355001526255 So you want to become a Mistress…
6192355001526256 I am becoming one already. So looking after them is my duty.
6192355001526257 You're getting ahead of yourself.
6192355001526259 Still, we're too different, you and I. I will always be your ally. But we aren't friends. I'm sorry.
6192355001526260 I can see that. Taking the children! Friends don't do that.
6192355001526261 I thought better of you, Victoria Olgimskaya. Your mother would never have done this. And leave my thoughts alone!
6192355001526262 You truly are your father's daughter. Children always succeed their parents…
6192355001526264 What do you mean, you'll linger in me? Like—intruding on my thoughts, even if you die?
6192355001526265 Perhaps.
6192355001526266 I still hope that was just my intuition, that you just have an overly active imagination.
6192355001526304 Khembe? Who is it? Who's there? Take this nasty cloth off of me, someone…
6192355001526305 It's me, kid…
6192355001526310 Emshen! You're not curing me, and my fingers… It hurts, khurganuudni untarna. It hurts!
6192355001526311 What do your fingers say?
6192355001526312 Do your fingers hurt?
6192355001526313 Come now… Yamar berkhe basaghan bai, you're doing great, girl! Just bear it a little more.
6192355001526314 Who's this?
6192355001526315 Me.
6192355001526316 Who did you expect? The angel of death?
6192355001526318 Just tell me, and don't ask idle questions about <i>relationships!</i> Is Capella alive?
6192355001526319 She is. For now.
6192355001526320 I'm sorry. No.
6192355001526321 Capella is the soul of this town. She'll live forever as such. That's her true existence.
6192355001526322 I knew you by the smell.
6192355001526323 How are you, kiddo?
6192355001526324  
6192355001526325 You shouldn't be here… Would you like me to carry you home?
6192355001526326 You don't need water right now, but you'll drink a lot in the future. You hear me? Lots!
6192355001526327 Not brilliant, to be honest… you all caught it. But there is some hope.
6192355001526328 Halves can't get infected. Especially cats. It only works with people… 
6192355001526329 I think you could have become one of ours. You're not limited by a single body. Know what I mean?
6192355001526330 Yeah.
6192355001526331 No.
6192355001526333 Well? What well?
6192355001526334 In the house where Olgimsky's son digged one… We knew about it long ago. Our Halves told us. They sneak around everywhere.
6192355001526335 Why?
6192355001526336 …Well, he deserved it! We thought we'd leave his punishment up to the Earth.
6192355001526337 …Let's not talk about it now.
6192355001526338 If only you knew what was beyond that well…
6192355001526339 Aren't you cold here? Lonely? Sad? Uncomfortable? How do you even survive in the winter…?
6192355001526340 Yeah… those people had no idea. Made rush decisions. Wanted to drag you away from here… Nonsense.
6192355001526491 See how it is here… Fucking trigger-happy idiots. Fucking morons, shooting our own…
6192355001526492 Why?
6192355001526493 If only you could all finish each other off even faster.
6192355001526494 There's a… split. Some follow the general, others follow Longin—the executive officer.\nWhat do you want here? Can't you see we're done for? Huh? <i>Huh?</i>
6192355001526495 Calm down.
6192355001526496 A split? Tell me more.
6192355001526497 …Hands up! I said, raise your hands, now!
6192355001526498 Calm down. I'm leaving.
6192355001526499 I'm a doctor. Put away the gun. Away, I said! There, I'm leaving.
6192355001526501 You paper-pusher… Wake up! I'm a <i>doctor!</i>
6192355001526502 …Show me your teeth one more time, and you'll carry them home in your pocket. Got it?
6192355001526503 Got it.
6192355001526504 What? Children were evacuated?
6192355001526505 Every one of them we could. This morning.
6192355001526506 But how…
6192355001526507 The general assigned several train cars and an artillery engine. That's the kind of man he is.
6192355001526508 …I've heard about him.
6192355001526509 No… but… no.
6192355001526513 You look strange… Cover yourself a bit, maybe?
6192355001526514 What for?
6192355001526515 What do you mean? It's… well, polite to do.
6192355001526516 You'd make a good Herb Bride. They see clothes as a hindrance, too.
6192355001526651 Where did they come from?
6192355001526652 Who?
6192355001526653 So you can see them, too?
6192355001526654 Who are you, kid?
6192355001526655 The bulls. Wake up and look around!
6192355001526656 I don't know.
6192355001526657 From the steppe, apparently. Where else?
6192355001526658 The Earth brought them to life, kid. That's the kind of earth we walk on.
6192355001526659 They're kinda hard to miss! Are they not real? Like a… hallucination?
6192355001526660 Doesn't seem so.
6192355001526661 I hope.
6192355001526662 What <i>are</i> they?
6192355001526663 Aurochs. The bulls of steppe legend.
6192355001526664 Bos Turokh… That's what they call the bull that created the world. I thought he was unique. One of a kind.
6192355001526665 No idea, kid. I'm as bemused as you are.
6192355001526666 All the streets are like… those old tales of yours. Like that book, "Baur Meges." Is this it? Did the steppe flood us all?
6192355001526667 That's the name. "Baur Meges." A tale of the world's creation.
6192355001526668 Perhaps… So Sahba's wish did come true. Or was it her plan?
6192355001526669 Are you scared?
6192355001526670 Scared? Are you nuts? When will I ever see anything like this again?
6192355001526671 Yeah? Well, I am.
6192355001526672 Never again. That much is true.
6192355001526673 What will become of… everything, now? Huh? Come on, tell me! Hey!
6192355001526674 I don't know. Let's walk around… and witness what we've done.
6192355001526675 This is what I wanted, you know. To preserve things almost extinct. Things that would otherwise be ground to dust by time, because tomorrow had no place for them.
6192355001526676 Me? I'm a friend of Sticky's, the kid you let die. You can call me Measly.\nI'm here to give you a tour of the Town. In his place. Oh, how he wished he'd stand here in my place. But he can't.\nYou failed him, so I'll pretend to be him, for you.
6192355001526677 I… I failed him.
6192355001526678 Well… it is how it is.
6192355001526679 Don't. Leave me.
6192355001526680 And he was so proud! Said you took him in as an apprentice. Said you'd make him into a great doctor. You were like a father to him… He'd never seen his real one, anyway. Yeah.
6192355001526681 That's maudlin enough, thank you!
6192355001526682 He was like a son to me, too.
6192355001526683 …
6192355001526684 Fine, I'll not say another word. I don't need to. You'll eat your own heart out for this by yourself, so why bother?\nBetter you tell me: Where did they come from?
6192355001526685 Who?
6192355001526686 I never thought I'd end up here… No matter how hard I tried to get inside, I couldn't. Admittedly, I was pretty scared of this place…
6192355001526687 I'd never been here, either… Until recently.
6192355001526688 So how do you like it?
6192355001526689 This is no place for children. It's antithetical to your world. Kids and beasts… inhabit the opposing ends of the vale of life.
6192355001526690 "The veil of life"? I've only heard the veil of death…
6192355001526691 "Vale." As in "valley."
6192355001526692 Vale of life, veil of death, wails of fate…
6192355001526693 Yeah, it's an odd idiom. I don't know what it means, either. Read it somewhere.
6192355001526694 Thought it was just a factory building. Or storage, maybe. Cold. Hooks, chains, meat smells…
6192355001526695 Those things you describe are in hell. We'll see them, in due time.
6192355001526696 Well, it does smell of meat… Blood, at least.
6192355001526697 It <i>is</i> a factory building.
6192355001526698 And what are those sounds? Is there a beast howling? Or just the wind?
6192355001526699 It's the Earth turning about in her slumber. This place is closest to her.
6192355001526700 There's this pit here… Hell's gate. The howling comes from there.
6192355001526701 Those are the spirits of ancient bulls saying hello. Allow me to translate: "What are these <i>humans</i> doing here? Especially that small one?"
6192355001526702 Ugh. I was asking seriously!
6192355001526703 That was a serious answer.
6192355001526704 Are you still surprised by anything?
6192355001526705 Everything is alive now, kid. So it expresses itself the best it can.
6192355001526706 At first, I thought the steppe couldn't reach this quarter. The Upper Town, the Stone Yard… never welcomed the steppe. It was tough for them here. Too high. Lads used to say worms are best suited to the soil, but this place is all stone and sky.
6192355001526707 It was the Kains' territory. A different town. Ours, but different.
6192355001526708 Just don't call the odonghs "worms" to their face. It offends them.
6192355001526709 You're right. It's strange.
6192355001526710 What face? They <i>are</i> worms. Aren't they? Born of the Earth… Eating Earth, hearing Earth. Earthworms.
6192355001526711 Not exactly. But they are connected to Earth.
6192355001526712 They do have faces. Are they not people to you?
6192355001526713 Is it true that those guys and the Herb Brides have their own language? And their own rites, too? And they marry?
6192355001526714 I don't know. I've never seen it.
6192355001526715 Bullshit.
6192355001526716 It's true, but be quiet. It's not nice to talk about it out loud.
6192355001526717 Why are they here? Why are they all sitting by the Crucible, looking at the Cathedral? What do they care? Did they come to pray?
6192355001526718 Well… times change.
6192355001526719 Pray to what? Time flows differently now. Can you feel it?
6192355001526720 Go over and ask them.
6192355001526721 Like hell… You ask them.
6192355001526722 I think we'd better stay quiet.
6192355001526723 What is there to ask? It's all obvious.
6192355001526724 The Kains said the Cathedral changes time itself. That's why they made it. But who would believe that…?
6192355001526725 Look around. Don't you find it believable?
6192355001526726 They're big talkers.
6192355001526727 Fair enough.
6192355001526728 Anyway, kid. I clearly see what I've done now. I guess it's for the best.
6192355001526730 What <i>have</i> you done?
6192355001526731 Saved all the things that surround us now. They were supposed to be ground down by time, to vanish. But now, they persevere.
6192355001526732 So that's what the doctor's oath was all about. Preserving life. I preserved all living things.
6192355001526733 Well… I made life interesting. It goes on, still as terrible and strange as before. People will have to find new roles in this ecosystem.
6192355001526734 Even the sand pest?
6192355001526735 Yes, kid. Even the sand pest.
6192355001526736 <i>All</i> things.
6192355001527052 
6192355001527053 
6192355001527054 
6192355001527751 Lara's Reflection
6192355001527752 She always had it in her.\nDo you recall? Adults could never see what such a prim and proper girl could want from being in your gang. A daughter to old Captain Ravel! She surely ought to stay ensconced among her books…
6192355001527753 …All the while, she was leaving ammo cartridges on train tracks.
6192355001527754 …All the while, she was catching bugs in jars and observing them.
6192355001527755 …She <i>was</i> proper, though. Carried a book around, sometimes. Was a brilliant distraction while we were busy filling our pockets with stolen candy.
6192355001527756 You see, she puts her stock in deeds and not in words. So Stakh was always close to her; for he would hear his heart, and act. A trait you share, Burakh.
6192355001527757 And the most taciturn of us all, Bad Grief.
6192355001527758 So she's… listening to her heart and acting, huh?
6192355001527759 It's not about a hidden inner fire—but she had real fun with your antics. A lot of your suggestions got a "no" from her—but then, at times, a "yes."
6192355001527760 And then one couldn't dream of a more reliable accomplice…
6192355001527761 I never figured out what she saw in us…
6192355001527762 He speaks so much yet does so much more.
6192355001527763 Can't argue with that.
6192355001527764 Does a lot of stupid things, yes, the ginger clown. But, you were saying…?
6192355001527765 Some things cannot be said with words, but come only with slaps, or bullets, or warming hands, or dripped from waterskins… You know it, sir? This is the only way she can express her grief for her departed father.
6192355001527766 I don't do slaps. But I get it.
6192355001527767 So they'll talk back to her, with bullets! Oh, tenegh…
6192355001527768 You know how much she loved her father.
6192355001527769 In the past tense? Don't you dare. She <i>loves</i> him.
6192355001527770 I do.
6192355001529551 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529552 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529553 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529554 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529555 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529556 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529557 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529558 
6192355001529560 
6192355001529561 Oh Lara… I'm not paying enough attention to you. But you'll do fine without me.
6192355001529562 I didn't bother with barrels. Did I make the right choice?
6192355001529563 Oh, the barrels… I didn't deal with them in time. Oh well.
6192355001529564 To hell with the chemist…
6192355001529565 
6192355001529566 I don't believe Saburov has found the real murderer.
6192355001529567 …To hell with the Saburovs. Now is not the time.
6192355001529568 Saburov is the governor. It's not my place to help him—it should be the other way around…
6192355001529569 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529570 I avert my eyes from strangeness.
6192355001529572 I didn't meet Murky's friend.
6192355001529573 Blowing up railroad tracks is the last thing I want…
6192355001529574 Notkin is dead… Should I pay my respects?
6192355001529575 Rubin's business is his own. Meaning, not mine.
6192355001529576 I didn't find Rubin's hideout.
6192355001529577 I'm neither Stakh's mother nor his father. Let him deal with his trouble himself.
6192355001529578 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529580 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529582 
6192355001529584 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529585 Some things I'll never learn.
6192355001529586 Some things I'll never learn.
6192355001529589 Grief's issues aren't important enough right now.
6192355001529590 Grief… Well, he's always been independent.
6192355001529591 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529592 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529593 I didn't help Anna.
6192355001529594 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529595 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529596 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529597 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529598 The Kin remain split. Perhaps this is how they become people…
6192355001529599 The Kin need no freedom. Beasts belong in a pen.
6192355001529600 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529601 Olgimsky hasn't come to face the Kin.
6192355001529602 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529603 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001529604 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001531651 
6192355001531652 
6192355001531653 
6192355001531654 
6192355001531655 
6192355001531656 
6192355001531657 
6192355001531658 
6192355001531851 Daniil Dankovsky, a Bachelor of Medicine.
6192355001531852 I'm surprised his officers even let you near him.
6192355001531853 Why do you all hate me so much? You think I'm a liar? I'm not! I've always had a healing touch!
6192355001531854 And yet today you don't. How convenient.
6192355001531855 People are working here, not taking confessions. Get out.
6192355001531856 I know. Any doctor knows.
6192355001532751 So you're fighting amongst yourselves now… A true outbreak. Worse than the pest…
6192355001532752 We've met.
6192355001532753 I had the strangest feeling some time ago. Did you… want to tell me something, maybe?
6192355001532754 …You've heard me!\nBut I can't speak of it now. It's too important. I'll return home soon. We'll discuss further there.
6192355001532755 So you two have secrets from each other, huh?
6192355001532756 Why are you smiling like that?
6192355001532757 Just imagining your long and happy life together.
6192355001532758 Forget it. Just in a good mood, that's all.
6192355001532759 "Useful," huh? I'll keep that in mind. Maybe I'll get a chance to brag that the Kains' son deems me <i>useful…</i>
6192355001532760 I'm not your errand boy.
6192355001532851 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001534151 
6192355001534851 
6192355001534852 
6192355001534853 I don't believe Stakh truly takes me for a patricide. He can't be <i>that</i> stupid.
6192355001534854 I missed Stakh yesterday. Should try today.
6192355001534855 Rubin is an idiot.
6192355001534951 I'll be damned… you shaved your head. Preparing to become a monk? Or a soldier?
6192355001534953 State your business.
6192355001534954 Urgent.
6192355001534955 I have an appointment.
6192355001534956 I want to report my progress with the curative serum.
6192355001534957 Stop lying, will you? Tell me straight—what kind of circus is going on here?
6192355001534958 Where's the general? I'd like to examine him and prescribe treatment.
6192355001534959 I'm not authorized to divulge that information. The general is quarantined, and attended to. You can go.
6192355001534960 Wait. How did the general get infected?
6192355001534961 You're a bad liar. Now tell me what you've done to him!
6192355001534962 Quarantined how? The whole fucking Town is infected!
6192355001534963 I cure everyone who is in need. I can help him too. I have the medicine! You hear me?
6192355001534964 But the general isn't.
6192355001534965 What?
6192355001534966 The infection that accumulates inside your body. Checking if you're ready for it.\nIf the world starts to go black before your eyes, escape the infected area before it envelops everything. But if the darkness gives way, that means it's lost interest in you… for now.
6192355001534967 You see interesting dreams, orderly.
6192355001534968 Have you taken twyrine, pal? Oral disinfection, huh?
6192355001534969 You speak as though the disease was a living creature. But it's just a bunch of microbes.
6192355001535251 
6192355001535254 
6192355001535255 
6192355001535256 
6192355001535257 
6192355001535258 
6192355001535259 
6192355001535260 
6192355001535261 
6192355001535262 I missed Rubin today, too. Ugh…
6192355001535771 I dreamt of Earth today… I walked barefoot across a cemetery, past bones in spring snowmelt. Why? What was the purpose of my life?
6192355001535772 What was the purpose of your life?
6192355001535773 Is that it? You're giving up?
6192355001535774 Fine, I'm an artist! A circus performer! An equilibrist. Happy now?
6192355001535775 You look unhealthy…
6192355001535776 And I'm a local priest. I'm here for your confession.
6192355001535777 In the old days, they believed circus performers go to hell. Remember?
6192355001535778 I'm from the Caravan. I was with the Caravan!
6192355001535779 Stop saying nonsense.
6192355001535780 Thought so.
6192355001535781 We kidnapped children. Lured them in, turned them into circus freaks. Our maestro even sold some—to anyone who could afford them.\nI suspended myself from the trapeze, enthralling them with my disciplined form, luring them backstage after the performance.
6192355001535782 I've heard of the Caravan. You made the papers…
6192355001535783 Come on, don't slander yourself. You're no equilibrist.
6192355001535784 This plague came after me. It's my punishment. I can't run, can't hide…
6192355001535785 You're not so important that a whole town would be destroyed over you.
6192355001535786 So you hide away in our backwater place, then?
6192355001535787 Yes.
6192355001535788 Is that why you hate dirt?
6192355001535789 Did you harm a lot of kids?
6192355001535790 Quite a lot, but I'm not good at counting. I can't even read.
6192355001535791 Makes sense. Circus performer…
6192355001535792 Well… You'll have to endure hell on your own.
6192355001535793 I don't want to die…
6192355001535794 No one does.
6192355001535795 But you'll have to.
6192355001535796 Then live. Perhaps you'll even make up for what you'd done…
6192355001535820 Come to think of it, we have a lot in common. I reek of misfortune, too. Our whole house does.
6192355001535821 I'm sorry about your loss. You're mourning Simon?
6192355001535822 As expected from Nina Kaina's daughter…
6192355001535823 Today, I dreamt of Earth… I went to a cemetery barefoot, for some reason. I saw human bones in the snowmelt, down below my feet.\nWhy? What was the purpose of my life?
6192355001535824 Huh. Unexpected words from the Kains' heiress…
6192355001535825 You're asking the wrong questions. You've had your life, and that's enough. How old are you, even? Early twenties?
6192355001535826 Simon's gone… Uncle Georgiy can't protect us. Mother is dead. And Father… Ugh, Father.\nAnd me? Who am I? I need to be like Mother, do what she did. Oh, no plague would dare touch us while she lived. She was a true Mistress.
6192355001535827 Just don't follow her directly.
6192355001535828 I never believed in all that Mistress nonsense.
6192355001535829 You never believed? <i>You never believed?</i> Who in this world cares what you believe!\nA Mistress brings to life all that her hands, words, and thoughts touch. Like the ancient king who turned water, bread, and trees into gold. Only, his touch ruined life; a Mistress' touch animates. There's no greater joy.
6192355001535830 How come?
6192355001535831 A Mistress holds a doll in her hands, and it comes to life. The Mistress thinks, and the doll remembers seven generations of its history. The Mistress dreams, and the doll acquires creativity.\nDo you understand now, heavy man reeking of blood and guts?
6192355001535832 I do. Stop shouting.
6192355001535833 Who do you think you are, talking to me as if we are equals?
6192355001535834 A doctor.
6192355001535835 Really?
6192355001535836 A person who has lived longer than you, and seen more.
6192355001535837 This plague came after me… to challenge me. Am I a Mistress yet? But no! I'm not… Ah, what do I do…
6192355001535838 You are a Mistress all right. By blood, if not in spirit.
6192355001535839 Live some more. Perhaps you'll grow into it.
6192355001535840 Nothing. Although… what about working as a nurse?
6192355001535841 I don't want to die…
6192355001535842 Yet at some point, you will.
6192355001535843 So don't. Aren't you a Kaina?
6192355001535844 Neither did Simon. He did truly seem like an immortal man…
6192355001535851 There's a hunt going on, looking for a person with my features.
6192355001535852 
6192355001535853 If you hear the Earth grumble, find the source. Stand still. She will show her roots to the patient.\n\nFeed the roots with blood. She rewards the generous with herbs.
6192355001535854 
6192355001535855 
6192355001535856 If you hear the Earth grumble, find the source. Stand still. She will show her roots to the patient.\n\nFeed the roots with blood. She rewards the generous with herbs.
6192355001535857 
6192355001535858 
6192355001535859 If you hear the Earth grumble, find the source. Stand still. She will show her roots to the patient.\n\nFeed the roots with blood. She rewards the generous with herbs.
6192355001535860 
6192355001535861 
6192355001535862 If you hear the Earth grumble, find the source. Stand still. She will show her roots to the patient.\n\nFeed the roots with blood. She rewards the generous with herbs.
6192355001535863 An outbreak of an odd disease turned everything upside down. I wonder what lies ahead.\n\nTomorrow will be very different from what I expected.
6192355001535864 He's… war… a magic pie… a letter… silken… at gunpoint… BLAM—e… and asph—alt drawings.\nI c-c-can't say—it. Are your wo—rds falling apart… too? Oh. Can it be c-c-contagiou—s?
6192355001535865 No, I'm fi—
6192355001535866 —no. I can't…
6192355001535867 … say all that I…
6192355001535868 want.
6192355001535869 I like new beginnings. Anticipation is the most invigorating part! That's why I was introduced to it so late. Oh well…
6192355001535870 Relatable.
6192355001535873 I got nothing.

6192355001536652 Sahba-ötün's Reflection
6192355001538451 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001538864 Because you're bitter, and rooted here.
6192355001538865 I'm not bitter.
6192355001538866 No, little girl… I'm a thistle.
6192355001538867 That was surprisingly apt.
6192355001538868 "Bitterroot." Gotta keep that in mind. Lara would love this.
6192355001538869 Want me to tell you a dream I had?
6192355001538870 Go ahead.
6192355001538871 No. I have enough of my own.
6192355001538872 I dreamt of Earth… A cemetery. Not ours—a different one, in a big city.\nI walked through it barefoot. Then I saw them there, in the snowmelt: the bones. I realized they were his beloved bones… Or maybe my own, even… Why? What was the purpose of my life?
6192355001538873 Don't put faith in dreams, daisy. You see all sorts of things in your sleep.
6192355001538874 I think they were your bones, forget-me-not.
6192355001538875 Whose bones were they, bellflower? Your tenant's?
6192355001538876 This plague came after me…
6192355001538877 Really?
6192355001538878 How are you so special?
6192355001538879 So you're all dressed up for it?
6192355001538880 I'm good for nothing. Worthless. I don't know my own purpose. Do you?
6192355001538881 I want to find my calling, and fulfill it. Wait, no… That sounds pompous.
6192355001538882 No, I don't.
6192355001538883 I would have never come back here if I knew.
6192355001538884 I want to find my roots. That's my purpose.
6192355001538885 You really are strange…
6192355001538886 You know… I tried to tell him, but he only laughs it off… I don't want to die! I know I must, but… but I don't want to.
6192355001538887 You must? No, you don't. So don't.
6192355001538888 But you'll have to.
6192355001538889 Dankovsky does that? Well, it's his area of expertise. If he laughs, it must be because you <i>will</i> live forever.
6192355001538950 Father and Simon. What did they have in common?
6192355001538951 
6192355001538952 
6192355001538953 
6192355001538954 
6192355001538955 
6192355001538956 Lara wants to turn her Shelter into a… well,  <i>shelter</i> for the homeless. To do that, she needs a personal water barrel.\n\nI'll need a good excuse to take one—and it's only doable in the Middle Town where a guard could transport it.
6192355001539251 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001540551 What is a town?
6192355001540552 What do you mean?
6192355001540554 A bunch of houses on a patch of land.
6192355001540555 …What is a town?
6192355001540556 I don't know.
6192355001541151 The Town is dead and empty. Let it all rot…
6192355001543851 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001544951 
6192355001544952 
6192355001544953 
6192355001544954 
6192355001545451 
6192355001545452 
6192355001545453 
6192355001545454 
6192355001545455 
6192355001545456 
6192355001545551 I had less time than I expected.
6192355001545552 Sometimes, a melody can be heard around the Town that only Victoria Olgimskaya and her daughter knew.\n\nTime to tell Capella about my findings.

6192355001548853 
6192355001548854 
6192355001549151 It keeps running off at the last moment…
6192355001549152 What are you talking about?
6192355001549161 Um… well… thank you.
6192355001549162 So, what about my reward?
6192355001549163 Took you some time to remember the magic words.
6192355001549177 It ran off! Darn it! Why were you all in my way?
6192355001549178 Did it work?
6192355001549179 Oh my. Who turned over the bowl?
6192355001549951 Did you find a lot of items?
6192355001549952 Funny… Yeah.
6192355001549955 Correct. A coffin.
6192355001549956 A coffin, huh…
6192355001549957 Why am I not surprised…
6192355001550851 
6192355001550852 
6192355001550853 
6192355001550854

6192355001551651 Khatangher
6192355001551654 Flattering. But I'm afraid the truth is much less fascinating.
6192355001551655 The truth being…?
6192355001551656 You didn't mention Rubin. Why? He's a doctor, too. More than Clara…
6192355001551657 They will, of course, summon Rubin, and me, and the ruling houses. But <i>you</i> will be their pawn. The inquisitors can identify extraordinary people from miles away, like bloodhounds.\nIt wouldn't be wrong to say that I'm no less intelligent than Daniil. And Stanislav is as good a surgeon as you. Still, we'll remain in the background. You will become the pawn.\nTrust me. I've seen them work.
6192355001551658 You're wrong. I'm not special.
6192355001551659 You flatter me.
6192355001552351 How do you plan to smoke in that thing on your face? Isn't it tight?
6192355001552352 Who are you, anyway?
6192355001552353 A doctor.
6192355001552354 A local butcher.
6192355001552355 Just, you know… an herbalist.
6192355001552357 What ugly orders we have… We're artillery, the god of war, commanded by General Block himself. The man's a legend. We were headed to the southern front, but they flung us here to fight the plague, somehow.\nHow do they expect us to fight it? We're not medics, we're artillery!
6192355001552358 Yes, you're artillery. So you'll likely be ordered to level the Town.
6192355001552359 And what about your legendary general?
6192355001552360 Here's our theory: our general, he's a thorn in everyone's side up there. I mean, people love him. He's an honest man. Got a personal code. But in that hornet's nest, honest folks are hated.\nSo The Powers That Be sent us here to get sick and die.
6192355001552361 No. He was sent here to get his hands dirty. You planning to shoot us? Your own people?
6192355001552362 That's possible.
6192355001552363 <i>If</i> there's an order. But the general isn't a butcher. He cares about his people. Still, if he gives an order, we'll follow it, whatever it is.
6192355001552364 Well, at least that was an honest answer.
6192355001552365 He may not be a butcher, but I am. I'll have to figure out what to do.
6192355001552366 Cares about people, huh? Well, we'll see.
6192355001555151 There's all kinds of joy in the world. You're just sheltered.
6192355001555751 Someone is selling a bull here. Only two hundred for a truly honestly talking pet! Deal of the year!\n\nThen again, it's a good healthy bull.
6192355001555752 I'm still curious... who are you, in truth?
6192355001556151 A herbal infusion. Drink to reveal places and events hidden from naked eyes.
6192355001556152 This herbal infusion reveals places and events hidden from naked eyes. But the town is currently quiet. I should try later.
6192355001557153 Everyone's on their own now. Only God is against everyone.
6192355001557155 Evil does destroy itself, it seems…
6192355001557251 Farewell Note
6192355001557252 "We're gone, but our caches stay! We asked jerboas. It's their game now. The jerboas introduced their own rules too. \n\nNyuta and Sleepy Head left shmowders in their Caches. You'd better find and take them, else the jerboas will eat them. Maybe they already have. And shmowders are bad for them!"
6192355001557253 Written by a kid with a trembling hand.
6192355001558051 Hey there, fellow traveler! You're right on time.
6192355001558052 Hey there to you too, fellow traveler.
6192355001558751 The Dead Item Shop is open.
6192355001559651 You may face the same fate, one day. You'll sing a different tune then.
6192355001559670 Why would we want the gaze of The Powers That Be upon us? Nothing for them to see, and the General doesn't need more headaches.\nSuch a death can be chalked up to the plague. We have an order to shoot anyone sick on sight. By nature, the inquisitors are sick people.
6192355001559671 What? Are you serious?
6192355001559672 It's a rumor, but I think it's true. Hard to verify something done so covertly… Hey, why do you care? You need her? You fall in love? Ha.
6192355001559674 Bullshit. Even you boneheads wouldn't dare attack an inquisitor.
6192355001559675 Yes, I need to see her. You have a big mouth.
6192355001559676 Maybe so.
6192355001559677 I'm going to pretend you didn't tell me that.
6192355001559678 Have you lost it? Whose orders were that?
6192355001559679 No one <i>ordered</i> it. You don't understand what's going on? Anarchy. Just hope to escape with your skin.\nOrders… When there's no order, there's no orders. Just some riflemen barging into that Cathedral of yours. That's how things are done now. All we need is a train back home…
6192355001559680 Did you see this happen yourself?
6192355001559681 Like hell you'll get a train. No one leaves. You're all staying here.
6192355001560251 I know what you mean.
6192355001560252 What are you after, big man?
6192355001560253 Happiness, like everyone else.
6192355001560254 A villain.
6192355001560255 An answer to a riddle.
6192355001560256 A cat.
6192355001560257 You uh… You're not planning to eat it, are you?
6192355001560258 The plague.
6192355001560259 Oh… I thought you were chasing the same cat we are.
6192355001560260 Why are you harassing the poor animal?
6192355001560261 I'm not in the cat chasing business. Cats are fast, and I'm clumsy.
6192355001560262 Cats are like that… No catching them unless they want to be caught.
6192355001560263 It's not a regular cat, okay?
6192355001560264 Is there even such a thing as a <i>regular</i> cat?
6192355001560265 Let me guess, it speaks?
6192355001560266 Can it do tricks or something?
6192355001560267 It's a see-through cat, that's what it is.
6192355001560268 Why don't you feed it? You won't see the cat, but you will see the food. Should make it easier to chase down.
6192355001560269 Could be the ghost of a long-dead cat. Leave it be.
6192355001560270 That's a great plan! You sure know a thing or two about cats, don't you?
6192355001560271 Not really. I had a hamster when I was your age. I'm allergic to cats.
6192355001560272 I kept mice and several rats. No cats allowed in the Burakh household.
6192355001560273 Choosing the right bait is half the hunt.
6192355001560274 I wish I knew more about bulls. Mine isn't invisible, but it sure isn't <i>regular,</i> either.
6192355001560275 Sure do.
6192355001560276 So what do we feed it?
6192355001560277 An invisible cat? Probably invisible mice.
6192355001560278 Cat love milk, don't they?
6192355001560279 Try radishes, or some parsley.
6192355001560280 Oh, come on! You don't believe us, do you?
6192355001560281 I'm just kidding. Get some milk, or cream, or whatever…
6192355001560284 Empty promises work best with invisible cats.
6192355001560285 Have you got milk?
6192355001560286 I've got some, though I'd prefer you lot drink it. It's good for your bones.
6192355001560287 I don't believe in cats in general, visible or invisible.
6192355001560288 Oh! Oh! How about a trade? Here, in my pocket… no, no, that's a bone… marbles, bullets… Gah, I need some time to fish it out. \nGo ahead and pour the milk. I'll have it out by then.
6192355001560289 Stop fidgeting, I'm not in a rush.
6192355001560290 I can handle that…
6192355001560291 It's a deal.
6192355001560292 Not a drop. I'm not a cat, am I?
6192355001560293 Can you get us some? Not much, just a bottle. I've got something really special for you if you do. Rare stuff, you won't find any on your own. \nFill the bowl and the treasure is yours, fair and square.
6192355001560294 All right, I'll see what I can do.
6192355001560295 No can do, kids. Food is getting scarce. You should catch a bird instead.
6192355001560296 You're welcome.
6192355001560297 Here you go. It's inside the box. We call it Burnie.
6192355001560298 Burnie?
6192355001560299 Burnie.
6192355001560300 So what is Burnie good for?
6192355001560301 Why do you call it that?
6192355001560302 I dunno.
6192355001560303 So what do I do with it?
6192355001560304 Not sure… It's one of the last shmowders. Old and powerful stuff. If you get really sick, you must gobble it up in one go, and then… and then…
6192355001560305 And then what?
6192355001560306 All of it? Should I eat the box, too?
6192355001560307 And then toss it over my shoulder with a prayer. Got it.
6192355001560308 You'll see, it'll work out somehow. There you go. \nAll right, gang, back to the plan! Thanks for the help, uncle. You can go.
6192355001560309 Just like that?
6192355001560310 You're making too much noise. It won't come around while you're here. You should leave, and we'll wait in ambush, all quiet and such.\n<i>Here, kitty kitty, here, furry feet, here's a tasty little snack for you to drink and eat…</i>
6192355001560311 Good luck. Give me a shout when you're ready to tackle the black cat in a dark room.
6192355001560312 Thanks. I think this might come in handy.
6192355001560313 Let's go, Burnie. These kids can handle themselves.
6192355001560314 Great ambush. You should get yourselves a trumpet, just to be sure.
6192355001560315 Oh, come on! How hard is it to grab a cat that's drinking milk? This is easy stuff! You know, fellas? We're done! I'm done running with you.
6192355001560316 You make it sound like it's my fault that it ran off.
6192355001560317 Yeah, it is! You scared it with all your stomping around, that's what happened! Can't you just walk on your toes for a minute?
6192355001560318 I just wanted to take a peek.
6192355001560319 Now I get why the cat's invisible—it vanishes when you try to look at it. Clever.
6192355001560320 Whatever.
6192355001560321 Calm down, kid. Your first try didn't work out—big deal. Try again.
6192355001560322 It's that inquisitor woman. She made herself a nest in the Cathedral, and here's the result! That's why time runs faster now. And it's denser…
6192355001560323 Why?
6192355001560324 Right, all trouble comes from emissaries. Anything's wrong, blame 'em.
6192355001560325 Yeah, they have guns.
6192355001560326 Should have looked at the flask and helped himself to the rifle. Would've worked out better.
6192355001560327 The front is here now, the most important one.
6192355001560328 Everyone is scared.
6192355001560329 No, it's not. The stork will deliver some more.
6192355001560330 They'll be back. You'll see. And more will come.
6192355001560331 One more stash…
6192355001560332 Twyrine won't purge the disease from the inside—even antibiotics won't.
6192355001560333 That's not what I meant.
6192355001560334 What did you mean, then?
6192355001560335 Drink twyrine, and your legs will carry you to small stashes. Hidden in old, broken furniture lying around the street, and such…\nSometimes, there's small boxes in those stashes, filled with powder. If you eat it, you'll get well. There's been a few cases already. Honest.
6192355001560336 Honest? Like hell. You need to get hammered to find a trunk in a yard?
6192355001560337 Those are kids' caches. They have… well, they <i>had</i> this game.
6192355001560338 "Shmowders." I know. They can kill you.
6192355001560339 No need to get <i>hammered,</i> that's undignified. Only, twyrine… it <i>leads</i> you. To salvation. To those tiny boxes.
6192355001560340 I think you need some sleep, pal. That's your salvation.
6192355001560341 Oh, it leads you all right, just not in a straight line.
6192355001560342 That's what <i>I</i> meant, though. Go breathe on someone else.
6192355001560343 Sure… Anything could happen.
6192355001560344 The Town can hear you. Walk slowly. Move quietly. You hurt it.
6192355001560345 Are you drunk?
6192355001560346 I know.
6192355001560347 I want to know more about Father, Judge. About his friendship…
6192355001560348 What is a town?
6192355001560349 An organism.
6192355001560350 A town is a process. It's movement. More often than not, it's slow and aimless, town creeping across the land like an oil stain.\nWe wanted to make a town that would grow upwards. Quickly. Purposeful.
6192355001563751 And what would be its purpose?
6192355001563752 In this town, people can make the impossible—if they're capable, of course. For it is a machine. A border-breaking machine.
6192355001563753 Meaning…?
6192355001563754 You refer to your family, but you're not this town's only builders.
6192355001563755 No, but we are its planners and designers. We shape it.\nThe merits of the three families are inarguable. We live in harmony, even as we pull in different directions—sometimes, commoners mistake that for adversity. Each family does its job. Each is irreplaceable.
6192355001563756 The other two at least make this town habitable.
6192355001563757 Still, tell me about Father. He was friends with your brother, wasn't he?
6192355001563758 I <i>am</i> telling you about them. If you're too impatient to hear the answer, I'm not holding you here.
6192355001563759 I apologize for my impatience.
6192355001563760 What work does this machine do, I wonder?
6192355001563761 Are people machines to you, too? Like, machines that produce ideas?
6192355001563762 No. People are mere infants, yet to even climb from their cribs. Larvae on the verge of transformation.\nA town is a process. A human is a process. Pointed up and forward, unlike what some would have you think. Past a certain age, certainly, our mind begins to degrade. Why is that?
6192355001563763 Such is our nature.
6192355001563764 The body dictates its laws.
6192355001563767 At least the other two pull it back to the ground.
6192355001563768 See the Polyhedron?
6192355001563769 The Tower on the other side of the river?
6192355001563770 No, my friend. That's the issue. It's not yet on the other side, and that is quite symbolic.
6192355001563771 What do you mean?
6192355001563772 Just like a person, the Town is a process. It grew. From ancient times, imprinted upon the neolithic Abattoir; from the ancient steppe upwards, towards the Gorkhon.\nNow it finds itself pressed against the river—a border. The Town has faced its limit, unable to move forward, unless we do the impossible.
6192355001563773 Well… maybe we're fine as we are now?
6192355001563774 It pushes people.\nTo do the impossible. To save themselves from drowning by pulling themselves up by their own hair. To force butterflies from their sad shells. To step over, break, overcome boundaries—of thinking and sensing, first and foremost. The limits of their conception of the world.
6192355001563775 You're insane…
6192355001563776 The time has come for us to cross to the other side. Even the Polyhedron, defying the law of gravity—one of the most binding architectural laws—is <i>still</i> not there. It stands on an island between the two banks.\nIt is a bridge. We've raised our foot over the abyss, but have yet to step forward. Frozen in the middle, we are. Still, this is a lot.
6192355001563777 Why are you doing all this?
6192355001563778 Bullshit. This is bullshit, Judge!
6192355001563779 This is what my brother and your father used to talk about. This is the core of their friendship, if you will! Isn't this what you wanted to know?
6192355001563780 It is.
6192355001563781 Is that so…
6192355001563782 This tower proves that any limit can be challenged.\nWe currently believe death is inevitable, just as we once believed human flight to be impossible. But people achieved it, and crossed unimaginable distances. This tower triumphs over the law of earth.
6192355001563783 So this is what Father and Simon used to talk about…?
6192355001563784 The Polyhedron isn't especially pretty… Are you sure it had to be built?
6192355001563785 How does it… remain there?
6192355001563786 Without magic, believe me. Limits can be challenged without miracles; all you need is will and imagination. \nThe rest is technicalities that you're unlikely to understand. Or are you an engineer? Have you studied structural loads?
6192355001563787 No. Not interested in engineering.
6192355001563788 They used to discuss the Town, its change and direction. They argued.\nI don't know what your father believed in. Simon… won't tell us anything, not anymore. But I've explained his ideas to you.
6192355001563789 Thank you, Judge. That would be enough.
6192355001563790 I won't pretend that I support them.
6192355001563791 I understand. I truly do now.
6192355001563792 But people don't fly on their own. We use machines.
6192355001563793 And death is not overcome in bodily form, else we'd all turn into horrendous struldbrugs, tortured by dementia and feebleness. It was in a certain adventure book, sort of.
6192355001563794 Thank you. I've seen books before, you know.
6192355001563795 How is death overcome, then?
6192355001563796 Perhaps this outbreak will give us an answer.\nDeath comes to those who devolve. Dullness is death. Fading is death. Only constant development of the self can overcome death.
6192355001563797 Ah. You have one answer for everything. The Kain answer.
6192355001563798 Was there anything else you wanted to know?
6192355001563799 What Father and your brother had in common, of course. Judging by your words, no two people could be more different…
6192355001563800 Bayarlaa, we're settling here. Most ventured deep into the steppe. Some fetch kindling; some draw water. They won't be back soon.
6192355001563801 Are there any sick among you?
6192355001563802 Wise.
6192355001563803 So you've split up? Isn't that forbidden?
6192355001563804 You're joking, esegher; I can see the lines of laughter in the corners of your eyes. How have we split? We walk the same ground. No walls, no enmity between us. Mother Boddho caresses our step.
6192355001563805 She caresses our step everywhere.
6192355001563806 I am joking, yeah. Be khara, is everyone healthy here?
6192355001563807 Everyone's healthy, esegher. The air is clean and light here.
6192355001563808 Light, my ass. My head's already aching from the scent of swevery…
6192355001563809 Bayartay, Kindred. It's good to see you all safe.
6192355001563810 Well, me, Rekka, Rita, Sleepy Head… All of us who are there already.
6192355001563811 Why did you shout?
6192355001563812 Why did you shout?
6192355001563813 What lies have you fed to him?
6192355001563814 Barin from the Skinners, that's certain. He hunted us with a knife afterwards, 'cause we'd seen him! For real!\nPerhaps he did your Old Man in too? Whaddyathink?
6192355001563815 …No. He's not <i>the</i> murderer. And you are a bunch of two-faced punks.
6192355001563816 That was an ugly and dirty thing to do. You should have just asked me directly.
6192355001563817 And? Like you'd do anything to help us! You've got a ton on your plate already.
6192355001563818 I might have.
6192355001563819 You did a dirty thing. Who could ever believe you, after this?
6192355001563822 I trusted you…
6192355001563823 Well, what did you think? That we're a bunch of angels?
6192355001563824 I need to rethink something.
6192355001563825 I was thinking you had some kind of conscience.
6192355001563826 I treated you as equals this whole time. Clearly I shouldn't have.
6192355001563827 Well, we won't direct this play, that's for sure. But I was talking about what awaits us inside.
6192355001563828 Guess we'll have to accept our fate, whatever it is.
6192355001563829 Inside? That's not a performance, just a run-through. Meaning she'll probably run each of us through with something sharp.
6192355001563830 I don't think so.
6192355001563831 What bird story?
6192355001563832 That's what they used to call these… special people. They had a particular way of spreading false information through a kind of… reflection. She invented the process, Aglaya Lilich.\nNo matter. But just that after that, she was blacklisted by the Powers That Be. Several people got purged from the government, too.
6192355001563833 So you know her?
6192355001563834 Wow…
6192355001563837 You'll see. Do you think she'll appreciate our Polyhedron?
6192355001563838 She must.
6192355001563839 I wasn't the one who built it. It was Farkhad, may his soul rest in peace.
6192355001563840 Why do you hate her so much?
6192355001563841 No.
6192355001563843 Agreed.
6192355001563844 I wonder how you'd withstand an interrogation.
6192355001563845 You know… It's beginning to grow on me.
6192355001566603 She drinks a lot of milk.
6192355001566604 What do I care?
6192355001566605 "She" who, Reflection? Your master?
6192355001566606 She sips water from the roots now. She's dead.
6192355001566607 
6192355001566608 
6192355001566609 
6192355001566610 
6192355001566611 
6192355001566612 
6192355001566613 
6192355001566614 
6192355001566615 
6192355001566616 Not dead, but back to Earth that cast her clay. That's what we are, we Kin. Our Mother Boddho, our Earth, will grant us one more birth. As twyre, as swevery, white whip, bodies or odonghe…\nKholboön, you speak as if born yesterday.
6192355001566618 Why are you here? A person's reflection dies with them.
6192355001566619 Know you what death is, yargachin? The rot that takes a body within Earth? You call that death? You jest, nynehen zayla…
6192355001566620 She was born of Earth, then? And will return from Earth?
6192355001566621 No one knows how she became herself.\nSuspicion and fear surround a tale of one who left the steppe. She's said to be inhuman, a doll of clay and bone: Shabnak-adyg.
6192355001566622 Yeah, right.
6192355001566623 There is blood in her veins.
6192355001566624 The same can be said of Earth. So what?
6192355001566625 Those are mere legends.
6192355001566626 My master waits for her assigned time.\nFive years ago, during the First Outbreak, Earth cast her with a secret task that must have been fulfilled back then.
6192355001566627 Are you saying that…
6192355001566628 No.
6192355001566629 The First Outbreak was curbed by your father, however. With vicious force he changed the flow of history.\nAnd Sahba-Usptae, Sahba-ötün, the one called Aspity by common folk, stayed behind within this world. A groomless bride, a blemish, lost, estranged from her true goals. Believes she owes her life to Isidor, who made her, who foresaw her…
6192355001566630 What do you mean, "made" her? What nonsense is this?
6192355001566631 I like her. She is… an abgai. A sister to me. I feel her care.
6192355001566632 She feigns humanity quite well, and holds respect and power in the Kin.\nShe rules over this hiding-place, where steppe folk can find escape from being yoked within Olgimsky's cruel mill. Here they can hide, and heal, and run their midnight markets…
6192355001566633 It's not funny, Reflection!
6192355001566634 Are there many such steppe people?
6192355001566635 The Kin respect our Sahba, although they fear her, too. But they rely on her protection. And she's their exegete, interpreter of ancient lore. Through her, the Kin remember their rites, their speech, themselves.\nThey know it not, of course; to them, she is a flame, and they are moths.
6192355001566636 So what? What use is any of that now?
6192355001566637 "Exegete?" I don't think I even know that word.
6192355001566638 Your father, whom she worships without understanding, meant the Kin to merge into the Town to make a body whole. But we cannot, and will not!\nSo she decided to adjust the Town to the needs of the Kin. She brokers work for brides and odonghs, setting them up as dancers or couriers.  One wonders why?
6192355001566639 …You're trying to take over the Town. You madmen!
6192355001566640 She doesn't know what she's doing.
6192355001566641 Indeed. She is not human, after all. But love does drive her, like it drives… you. And love is blind and foolish…
6192355001566642 Not always.
6192355001566643 Not human. Right. I'll try to accept that.
6192355001566644 You're lying. She <i>is</i> human. I can tell.
6192355001566645 Yes.
6192355001566646 The Kin are slaves, Reflection. Beasts. Have been such for many years.
6192355001566647 So she's not human? I don't believe you.
6192355001566648 Not slaves, but a hydra of apathy. They do not care for freedom, for self, or dignity, like you might value.
6192355001566649 So you're saying she was born five years ago? The First Outbreak…
6192355001566650 Enough. Enough to flood the Town.
6192355001566754 Do-Gooder
6192355001566755 It's forbidden for Herb Brides to have footwear: it's believed they speak with Earth through their rhythmic footsteps. Winter must get cold…
6192355001566756 Offer protection from contaminated air. Not the best, but they do their job.
6192355001566757 It should be noted that whoever came up with the idea of selling random pieces of cloth as "cloaks" has a very keen and shameless business sense, and I think I know who…
6192355001566758 A piece of rough cloth. Can be used as a protective cover against infection during contact… somewhat.
6192355001566759 <i>"How does one call upon menkhu, the faithful of the Kin? Know them by their hands, for they are butchers…"</i>
6192355001566760 Do they even protect against infection, or do they just absorb it, making you a carrier?
6192355001566761 This mask resembles those worn by medical personnel, but instead of sterile gauze, it's made of dirty cloth, and instead of clinging tightly to my face, it hangs loose. Frankly, it's just a rag with two ties.
6192355001566762 A basic item that covers the face and protects against plague clouds… somewhat.
6192355001566763 A ridiculous mixture of random pills cures sand pest.\n\nMaybe it's because the plague itself is a combination of many diseases? It attacks every organ, every Layer, and changes every day.
6192355001566764 A box filled with powder made of assorted ground pills. Extremely harmful, but somehow cures sand pest.
6192355001566765 Master says you're doing well. He said, "With each hour, fewer and fewer people think he's the murderer." He said, "Tell him that I want to talk; let him come to the Lump." Right away.
6192355001566766 Your "Master"?
6192355001566767 Since when do people have masters in this town, boy?
6192355001566768 What for?
6192355001566769 Big Vlad.
6192355001566770 Ah, Olgimsky. What does he want with me?
6192355001566771 If he's summoning you, you must go. "No dawdling," he said.
6192355001566772 True. If Big Vlad calls, you come.
6192355001566773 I'll come by when I can. You tell him that.
6192355001566774 If he needs me so much, let him come to me.
6192355001566775 Don't you know? We all have but one true master since the Factory was built.
6192355001566776 Perhaps Olgimsky wants me in his service as well?
6192355001566777 We'll see about that.
6192355001566778 Perhaps he does.
6192355001566779 Won't be easy for him.
6192355001566780 What does he want?
6192355001566781 Master says you need protection. He said, "I don't think he's the killer." He said, "Tell him that I want to talk; let him come to the Lump." Right away.
6192355001566782 Who's your master?
6192355001566783 Right away, huh? Well who am I to refuse such a thoughtful and polite invitation?
6192355001566784 Since when do people have masters in this town, boy?
6192355001566786 Messenger
6192355001566787 
6192355001566788 Messenger
6192355001567151 "Death's but a word. A collection of letters. We only need it to keep us unnerved." What does that mean for us?
6192355001567152 What does that mean for us?
6192355001567153 What does that mean for me?
6192355001567154 "I don't suppose it's about to get better. But just deserts are about to get served."
6192355001567158 Go. Act. From now on, I will watch you with genuine interest. You were clearly doing this on purpose; meaning you must beginning to understand.
6192355001567159 To be honest… No, it wasn't on purpose.
6192355001567161 That's it. There's nowhere else to go.\nYou're still trying—that deserves respect. If you can figure out how to overcome death even now, burdened with all possible limits in a world completely mangled and rotten, then it was all worth it.
6192355001567162 That's the first time you've said something nice to me.
6192355001567165 The door opens…
6192355001567166 …And I walk out.
6192355001567167 …But the lodger stays.
6192355001567181 …Cold and fear await outside.
6192355001567182 …And an ocean is heard.
6192355001567183 …Close it back, please!
6192355001567184 …Say hello to me.
6192355001567185 I was thinking about taking away your hands.\nIt's a useful limitation. Actors shouldn't flail around—they even tie their hands behind their backs, sometimes. That encourages development of better facial expressions, body language… ingenuity, in general.
6192355001567186 Hands? No! Not my hands!
6192355001567187 So take them away from your actors. I'm not one—didn't I tell you?
6192355001567188 I'd like to see you try.
6192355001567189 You can't do anything to me. You're awful funny…
6192355001567190 I'm not a fan of displaying affection. If it's present, it shows.
6192355001567191 No.
6192355001567192 Well, no means no.
6192355001567193 Hunger it is, then…
6192355001567194 You try being in my shoes…
6192355001567195 <i>…Oh, the famine and the fever! Oh, the wasting of the famine!</i>
6192355001567196 I'll just have to keep an eye out for bread, then.
6192355001567197 And let me remind you: Your health continues to dwindle. Well, such are the rules. With each new mistake, every time you come to this stage…
6192355001567198 …This is no stage. It's the gallows.
6192355001567199 The last thing I need…
6192355001567200 Right. I… forgot about that.
6192355001567201 You'll become exhausted quicker. Will probably have to sleep more. And Sleep in the brother of Death. It diminishes… not your life, maybe, but the number of times you can act and influence the world.
6192355001567202 Only the number of actions, not their importance.
6192355001567203 It diminishes my life, too.
6192355001567204 Quite so. Oh, and don't forget that…
6192355001567205 Yeah, yeah. Every time I die, my life force dwindles. I remember.
6192355001567206 How could I forget…
6192355001567207 That's all right. It's my burden. I can bear it.
6192355001567217 Tell yourself: I'm exhausted, I can't take it anymore. Feels natural, doesn't it? This admission could save your life. Take pity on yourself and stop in time.
6192355001567218 No. It's not my style.
6192355001567219 As a doctor, I agree. All organisms need rest.
6192355001567220 No. One can't admit that. You must work yourself to death, period.
6192355001567221 Ugh, I've always hated this kind of person! They lie that they can do whatever's needed… then they fall, exhausted, at a critical moment!
6192355001567222 Such a paradox! To admit you're tired—is that a step towards death? A surrender? An admission of your natural limits? Or is it a step back to whatever happens before death?\nWhat is real life?
6192355001567223 Food for thought.
6192355001567224 To overcome weakness, one must acknowledge it. Wouldn't you agree?
6192355001567225 A step towards death. I think I understand.
6192355001567226 What about all those stories teaching us that resignation and acceptance sometimes lead to the true victory?\nMany wise men took exhaustion as a sign that death was a gift. Immortality is the curse of incurable exhaustion.
6192355001567227 It's a different kind of exhaustion. The spiritual kind.
6192355001567228 It's true.
6192355001567229 I'd rather not think about it. It's the healthiest way.
6192355001567230 The monologue of a madman who considers people to be mere actors in his show, and himself their sole director.
6192355001567231 Your actors might confuse precious items with trash. I won't.
6192355001567232 Where once existed living tissue, you'll now find death.\nYou don't believe me, though. You think I'm just trying to scare you, that it's all make believe to me. You've hinted at that more than once.
6192355001567233 Of course I don't believe you.
6192355001567234 Everything is living. Everything is alive.
6192355001567235 I don't "hint." I'll tell you outright that I don't believe you.
6192355001567236 No. It doesn't work anymore. You're not curing anyone; you're curing the wrong people in the wrong place in the wrong way!
6192355001567237 Who should I cure?
6192355001567238 Where should I cure them?
6192355001567239 How should I cure people?
6192355001567240 Search! That's the point of the exercise! It's not my place to tell you! I'm just a prompter giving hints.
6192355001567241 I've had enough of you.
6192355001567242 Yeah? Well, I'll tell you. What I consider alive will be alive. Got that?
6192355001567243 I'm out of here.
6192355001567351 There will be blood.
6192355001567352 <i>Baur Meges,</i> the holy tale of the Kin, does speak of the <i>self</i> as poison. It rises and bellows: "Me!"\nDiscord soon follows, then blood. Calamities, fear.\nYou've seen it all a couple days ago.\nWe do not have this. We are a whole.
6192355001567353 You're saying some frightening things.
6192355001567354 There is some merit to that.
6192355001569274 Then it was a hunch. In any case, you've become an interesting subject—finally! Both you and your idea of Artemy Burakh. So act.
6192355001569275 I hope I never see you again.
6192355001569276 It's always been worth it.
6192355001569277 No… It wasn't.
6192355001569278 I guess I am.
6192355001569279 I still don't understand a thing.
6192355001569280 Well… watch me, I guess.
6192355001569281 Nothing changed. You're imagining it.
6192355001569294 The actor must understand how to work death. I'm not making this one for the audience, but for the actors themselves. <i>Their inner world</i> is the stage. Their worldview.\nHence the… unusual methods. Unusual and rough. It's the theatre of cruelty.
6192355001569295 Just how rough are we talking here?
6192355001569296 Look, I do what the subject demands of me. I'll set your tasks gradually and uncover the method step by step—else you'll sabotage the process.\nYou're here for an audition, after all, aren't you?
6192355001569297 Me? No. I'm just curious.
6192355001569298 I'm not an actor. From what I can tell, I'm one of the people your actors will play. A person directly involved in the events.
6192355001569299 Sure.
6192355001569300 Curious. But I'm not interested in costumes.\nI'm interested in showing the authentic relationship of man and death. Stage props are unneeded for that; what one needs is a method.
6192355001569301 What method?
6192355001569302 No one does. Old theatre is dead. The building we're standing in is just a shell of a theatre. A cocoon, an abandoned chrysalis, hell, maybe even a coffin, should the play be a flop.\nYou know, the world's a stage—I've truly taken that to heart.
6192355001569303 What play are you staging?
6192355001569308 What do you mean?
6192355001569309 So, you don't have much stage property? This place looks empty.
6192355001570451 On time?
6192355001570452 Today is a special day. A Day Backwards. Usually, I collect dead things; today, I sell unborn ones.
6192355001570453 What do you mean?
6192355001570454 "Sell"? As in, for money?
6192355001570455 Today, yes.
6192355001570456 Huh. So what do you sell?
6192355001570457 I thought rag-and-bone people had no use for money.
6192355001570458 In general, we don't. But money is about to become a dead thing, too. I'm preparing.
6192355001570459 So what do you sell?
6192355001570460 I have these bits of paper, see? Candy wrappers. Absolutely useless. You can't do anything with them.\nI'm selling them for money. Today only. And they're expensive, too.
6192355001570461 Why the hell would I want to buy candy wrappers for money?
6192355001570462 …You're saying frightening things.
6192355001570463 "Unborn things," huh… So they're useless now, but that could change?
6192355001570464 That, I will not explain.\nPerhaps this is my attempt to save you, fellow traveler, giving away diamonds for the price of sugar. Or maybe I'm trying to swindle you, as befits a merchant. Or it's all just a prank. Who knows? Not you.
6192355001570465 So explain like a normal person!
6192355001570466 You like blind deals, don't you?
6192355001570467 The stakes are your fate, fellow traveler. You're sewn to yours with a double seam. Meaning, you can do anything—fate won't let you go astray. Even if you don't yet understand the meaning of your actions.\nListen! What does Fate whisper? Should you take my candy wrappers?
6192355001570468 It whispers, "Don't waste your time on old buffoons."
6192355001570469 Doing things blindly… Yeah, that's my style.
6192355001570470 Are you suggesting we're still playing back on the train? That's an unnerving thought…
6192355001571251 I never thought you were a believer, General.
6192355001571252 I wasn't until yesterday.
6192355001571253 What do you mean?
6192355001571254 Yeah… the way things are going, we don't have much left besides faith.
6192355001571257 Who are you?
6192355001571258 Artemy Burakh.

6192355001575554 VICTORIA'S TRACE
6192355001575555 A melody plays here now.
6192355001576751 Back again, Burakh? Hmph… like a shuttle in a weaver's loom…
6192355001576753 Your son is going to the Termitary.
6192355001578251 
6192355001578351 Bite kharaan, you want to take our Mother? You cannot have her. We won't let you. She won't let you.
6192355001578352 I <i>am</i> taking her. Try and stop me.
6192355001578353 Fine, fine.
6192355001578354 Would you lead us, then? Rule us wisely, by the Lines? Hear the bellowing of Mother Boddho? Protect us from harm, eradication?
6192355001578355 Maybe.
6192355001578356 No. But I want to help you.
6192355001578357 Who are you to give us orders? You're not our ruler.
6192355001578358 You need no rulers.
6192355001578359 Shudkher! Do you really see yourselves as a herd in need of a shepherd?
6192355001578360 We need parents, aba ezhe. We are a family, a Khatanghe. Your father's dead. Tycheek's dead. You refuse to take your father's burden.\nYet we have our Mother. We won't give her up.
6192355001578361 I'm trying to become whatever Father was!
6192355001578362 You're not children! And you don't need a ruler.
6192355001578363 We are the Khatanghe, the Kin. We obey strength. As long as Fat Vlad rules over us, we belong to him. When he dies, we'll listen to another. To you.
6192355001578364 So that's what you meant…
6192355001578365 While the mare carries a rider, it will turn wherever he pleases. Is that what you mean?
6192355001578366 Baygalday. I won't have it.
6192355001578367 Then help us break free.
6192355001578368 How?
6192355001578369 We cannot obey you, emshen. Even if we wanted to.
6192355001578370 Why?
6192355001578371 Did you not hear what our Mother said? A head cannot be taken from its body. She can't leave this place without us. We won't let her go to certain death with a stranger. A body is whole.
6192355001578372 I'm not a stranger.
6192355001578373 Be khara, my own people are destroying themselves… You deserve it!
6192355001578374 You are a stranger until proven otherwise. Your deeds are that of a stranger. Medenegshe, you are not part of us.
6192355001578375 What proof do you need?
6192355001578376 I am part of you.
6192355001578377 Show us that you're on our side. Show us that your knife can trace the Lines. Show us that you can cut.\nBring us Big Vlad. A weakling cannot do that. Then we will listen.
6192355001578378 Stop pushing!
6192355001578379 By oylgono ugyb. I don't understand what you mean.
6192355001578380 You want blood… Why is it always blood?
6192355001579051 Hey doctor, you got a leash? I <i>really</i> need one.
6192355001579052 Why would I have a leash?
6192355001579053 How about a tourniquet? It kinda looks like one.
6192355001579054 Anyway, doctor! You got a leash or not?
6192355001579055 I might have one.
6192355001579056 I'm not just asking randomly. I'll trade it for a shmowder. A real, working one! It cures the plague! I totally checked!\nWe don't need shmowders in the Tower anyway—it's free from infection. But you could use one. It's not like there's any other use for the leash. For you, it's just a piece of leather. For me, it's destiny!
6192355001579057 A shmowder, huh? Let's trade, then.
6192355001579058 I don't have a leash, but don't go far. If I ever find one in my pocket, I'll bring it to you.
6192355001579951 And I'm not staying. Goodbye.
6192355001579954 She's not dead? Are you implying she could come back to life?
6192355001579955 Yes and no. Your thoughts are stiff and narrow. You find that life and death are incompatible.\nOne can still feel her breath and catch a glimpse of her reflection. Her future still remains unsaid, and I will speak of her as if she was alive.
6192355001579956 Fine… I'll play along. Out of respect.
6192355001579957 Khan! I've finally found you. My father had a list…
6192355001579958 ...of children he took a particular interest in, yes. He considered us this town's future.\nYou've inherited that list. Capella told me.
6192355001579959 It means I'll take care of you.
6192355001579960 There's no need. The Polyhedron protects me.
6192355001579961 That's not up to you.
6192355001579963 Miracles work best in conjunction with actual pills.
6192355001579964 Fine. My father had a list…
6192355001579965 Well, the twin is dead, too.
6192355001579966 …A double?
6192355001579967 Stellar job, Dora. Brilliantly done.
6192355001579968 I mean… she distributes bread from here… like, if your house got burned, or you want to escape quarantine. Means anyone can come in. She doesn't lock the door, either. The Shelter <i>is</i> a shelter.\nAnd now she asked for someone to replace her.
6192355001579969 She did find a way to serve the people, after all… So why does she need replacement?
6192355001579970 But <i>who was executed?</i> Tell me, now!
6192355001582851 Like you don't have a more cheerful subject… Say, life.
6192355001582852 It's one and the same. Especially considering my new method.
6192355001582853 Killing actors for real?
6192355001582854 Intricate.
6192355001582855 What's the point?
6192355001582856 Is the outside not cruel enough for you?
6192355001582857 It's a different kind of cruelty, not the one you're used to. Being unforgiving towards yourself, mostly… but you need not concern yourself with this…
6192355001582858 Why?
6192355001582859 Fine. "Death is never quick. Understanding is a process. Unpleasant, but unavoidable." 
6192355001582860 Loud and clear… It's a miracle you're not in jail.
6192355001582861 Such as?
6192355001582862 Are you unfamiliar with the word? The world you're acting in changes with each… ahem… stage death of our hero. Forever.\nEven if we had a chance to trick time, go back, and start over from a turning point, the consequences of death would remain.
6192355001582863 So what happens next?
6192355001582864 I'm not an actor, I'm a doctor. You seem to have confused me with someone.
6192355001582865 Bravo! Great job! Keep up that demeanor!
6192355001582866 What demeanor?
6192355001582867 Be my guest and complain to Saburov. But I think he's busy with bigger things than judging the ethics of my creative endeavors.
6192355001582868 What are you up to?
6192355001582869 Whatever… then someone else will replace you. Next!
6192355001582870 What kind of consequences were you talking about?
6192355001582871 Yeah. You act. I'll go and do my job.
6192355001582872 Why are you doing this?
6192355001582873 Bullshit. Act all you want, but you're not some sorcerer who can actually do that to a person.
6192355001582874 Didn't I make it clear enough that clocks won't help you?\nA clock is just a point from which a successor begins. But they still carry their predecessors' mistakes. Else we'd never solve this riddle!
6192355001582875 What is your goal, anyway?
6192355001582876 What riddle?
6192355001582877 I'll explain it to your successors, if you fail… Clearly those will be beyond help anyway, those third-rate phonies, so I'll have to spell everything out to them. Wonderful…
6192355001582878 You're a dangerous man, Mark Immortell. Is that a last name or a nickname, by the way?
6192355001582879 You're a curious person. You make me regret I'm a surgeon, not a psychiatrist.
6192355001582880 Enough gossip.
6192355001582881 A random applicant. Can I have this role?
6192355001582882 Good. Your life force has dwindled. It will dwindle even further with each new death… If you're not scared, act.
6192355001582883 Anything else?
6192355001582886 Is this real? Then no… I don't want to be part of this.
6192355001582887 But you already are. You take part in it with every breath, every word, every moment of your life.
6192355001582888 So what's my new… limitation?
6192355001582894 We're meeting for the first time. Although, you do have some features in common with your predecessor.
6192355001582895 For the first time? What do you mean? Who are you?
6192355001582896 I'm an impresario. I only hire actors, that's all. When one of you dies, I handle the replacement.
6192355001582898 Well, the previous rehearsal was… unsuccessful. So now we play rough. There's more malice in the world—this will not, cannot change.\nAdversity makes people <i>strive.</i>
6192355001582899 If the goal of your play is to overcome death, the invincible foe, why make that more difficult?
6192355001582900 To avoid complacency! Complacency <i>is</i> death. It will drag you into the abyss—the very abyss we're trying to overcome.
6192355001582901 So how do you intend to do this?
6192355001582902 Because I don't care about your emotions—only your understanding. If the actor understands how to work with death, so will others. Like me.\nDon't worry, though: in truth, what you see out there is a stage, too. It's also a model, like the one in the background behind me.
6192355001582903 Spare me this cheap philosophy. You may call it a stage; to me, it's life.
6192355001582904 And some supposed real life waits on the other side? Screw you. I'm in no rush to kick the bucket.
6192355001582905 What do you want?
6192355001582906 What do I want? A good play. No one's ever staged this one before.\nYou must break away from your limits—I'm interested in that, too. Push the limits of a theatrical stage, of drama, of form. Push the actor beyond their role. The play itself, beyond this sorry theatre.
6192355001582907 In that, our goals align.
6192355001582935 Please don't think that it's about capturing agony. I'm not the kind to burn models alive in an attempt to write truthful suffering.\nMy interests lie elsewhere. It's not about cruelty, or the inevitability of the end. The triumph of death… All of that is only a reason, an excuse.
6192355001582936 Then what is your play about? Me?
6192355001582947 Undoubtedly. It's about the person. The actor.
6192355001582948 I'm not an actor! I'm Artemy Burakh, in the flesh. Open your eyes, clown!
6192355001582950 I need different actors to continue the same path, each starting where the previous died, so their interpretation of the character carries on.\nHere's my question: When does the actor become the character?
6192355001583151 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001583251 That's it. There's no one here anymore. The Theatre is closed, we're all sick of it. Literally nauseated.
6192355001583252 Closed? How?
6192355001583853 You're a reflection.
6192355001583856 The sand pest defies its own rules. It's about to infect all of my kids, and there's nothing I can do about it.
6192355001583857 Sick? Why?
6192355001583858 Clearly not closed well enough, since you're here anyway. But everyone else is gone.
6192355001583859 Where?
6192355001583871 The dog-headed ones. Khan's army. They live in the Tower. Are you all right in the head, uncle?
6192355001583872 It's just… Notkin's lot could also be called that, couldn't they? They have bonds with their animals. Don't they get confused about sides?
6192355001583873 Got it. So is there some trouble?
6192355001583874 Not at all. The Soul-and-a-Halves get half a soul more, and the Dogheads get half a head. Not even remotely similar.
6192355001583875 Fair enough. So what happened at the Dogheads' place?
6192355001583876 Other people are reluctant to talk now, too. No one want to touch others anymore, not even with words.
6192355001583877 Worst thing is, they do have corpsmen. The huge guys with boxes on their backs? They burn the sick. So let them! But why do we, the living, have to suffer? Why do they need to level the Town?
6192355001583878 You can't hide from death under a pile of corpses.
6192355001583879 They burn the sick? Better to avoid them, then.
6192355001583880 The sick are still alive, too.
6192355001583883 You won't tell her anything.
6192355001583884 Because the director went out for a smoke—four hours ago. Anyone would get sick from smoking a cigarette that long. And he took the coat!
6192355001583885 Is he, like… gone gone?
6192355001583886 Why?
6192355001583887 How should I know? I'm a junior prop designer, no one reports to me. But the Theatre is empty now. Do not come back.
6192355001583888 So there won't be anymore pantomimes at night?
6192355001583889 I'm afraid I will return.
6192355001583891 Pantomimes? Oh, pantomimes… No, there will still be pantomimes. They're <i>there,</i> you see. I'm talking about <i>here.</i>
6192355001583892 So that's what the fellow traveler took from me… Philosophy discussions. Could have been worse.
6192355001583894 Seems like you had a lot on your plate recently… and I don't even know what it was about.
6192355001583895 See how it turned out? I came back, but you… seem to be leaving.
6192355001583896 Thieves rarely take a single coin. They usually grab the whole purse. Just saying.
6192355001583897 You're saying the talks with the director aren't the only thing I've lost? What have I gotten myself into…
6192355001583898 I'm not greedy.
6192355001583899 Tourniquet your clever ass, will you? I need an actual leash, a Soul-and-a-Half one.
6192355001583900 Why would I have a leash?
6192355001583901 You mingle with Notkin's pack. Everyone's seen that. So I was thinking, maybe they gave you one already? That would kinda make you a Soul-and-a-Half yourself… So then it's not deception, I think.\nThe Soul-and-a-Halves are like that. They got no standards, and just accept anyone who comes to them. Maybe even you.
6192355001583902 No one's a Soul-and-a-Half until they've got a Half.
6192355001583903 So who do you plan to deceive? I mean, <i>not</i> deceive?
6192355001583905 Thank you, kind girl.
6192355001583906 We Dogheads have order. We're not a pack, but an organization. There are watchdogs, shepherd dogs, service dogs, hounds… even guide dogs. The ones who go <i>in.</i>\nAnyone can become anything if they try! Not like <i>that</i> lot, completely dependent on what pet chooses you. What if it's a frog? Or a cockroach? Anyway, those Halves of theirs don't even exist!
6192355001583907 "Go in"? What?
6192355001583908 Up the Tower. I mean, down the Tower. I mean, forget it. I misspoke.
6192355001583909 Fine. So why do you need a leash?
6192355001583910 What about you? Are you a watchdog? A hound?
6192355001583911 So why do you need a leash?
6192355001583912 I'm almost a hound. All I need is one more leash. It's a test… to show how many Soul-and-a-Halves I've defeated. Get it? Battlefield glory!
6192355001583913 And the leashes are, of course, taken from lifeless bodies of your foes.
6192355001583914 You're a tough bunch.
6192355001583915 It's not like we tear off fingers! They got crates of leashes in the Warehouses, and make more. Chara takes one from Gray every week.\nPlus, we don't <i>have</i> to take them by force. Diplomacy and deception are also viable options.
6192355001583916 You commander isn't in the Polyhedron. He's over there. Is that fine?
6192355001583917 You're a downright saint.
6192355001583918 Sounds more like a tracker than a hound.
6192355001583919 Makes it even easier to deliver the loot. He's the leader, anyway.
6192355001583920 Akela never misses, huh?
6192355001583921 Loyalty is commendable.
6192355001583925 No. A leash is a symbol of trust. And I won't trade away trust.
6192355001583926 Death is everywhere these days.
6192355001583927 You can carry me into the infection, but not out? And the air won't drive you down, even though it's still infected? Sounds fishy.
6192355001583928 Why are you standing here, then?
6192355001583929 We are Children of Boddho, Burakh the menkhu. Half-Earth, half in the Earth. The plague cares not for us.
6192355001583930 What am I supposed to do now?
6192355001583931 The plague accepts everyone, and lets go of no one.\nPerhaps our boats refuse to travel infected water. Or maybe those are just words. Maybe we simply do not want to spread infection.
6192355001583932 This is a sensible argument. Why didn't you say so from the start?
6192355001583933 When one talks sense, they get begged and bribed. But what use would it be to bribe monsters in magic boats?
6192355001583934 All right… What do I do now?
6192355001583935 Go back on foot, menkhu. The plague is the Earth. One cannot escape it by water.
6192355001583936 Like I have a choice.
6192355001583937 You'll still carry it on your own skin.
6192355001583938 Your speech is very clear, too. A real townsperson, aren't you…
6192355001583939 Hope I can make it…
6192355001583940 Something bad happened to you, Cub. You got sick, I think. Our dogs found you on the ground.
6192355001583941 Have I fainted?
6192355001583942 The air was all black…
6192355001583943 It's emission from the Factory. \nDad says they only used to pollute the water, but now the air's poison too, and life is suffering, and the Pig is a bloodsucker and worse.
6192355001583944 And Mom?
6192355001583945 Well, he's not wrong…
6192355001583946 Mom says nothing. Just keeps praying. Aunt Dora said she saw the same stuff five years ago.
6192355001583947 Five years ago, huh…
6192355001583948 Well. Thanks for rescuing me.
6192355001583949 What happened to me?
6192355001583950 Aren't you a bit too young to play with Notkin's gang?
6192355001584751 Why?
6192355001585151 
6192355001585152 
6192355001585153 
6192355001585154 
6192355001586351 I don't know.
6192355001586375 I see you have a question.
6192355001586376 Yeah. It doesn't make sense. So each new death brings me closer to defeating it?
6192355001586377 What do you mean, "each new death"? We're not in a fairy tale, people don't come back to life. And what do you mean by "defeating"?
6192355001586378 Then how…
6192355001586379 How is death overcome? Not defeated, mind you, but <i>overcome?</i>\nI told you already. Many times. By changing the attitude. Who dies? What dies? A person? What is a person? Their memory of personal experience? Others' memories of them? A personality, a body, a soul?
6192355001586380 A body.
6192355001586381 Remember the Kains' method: to solve the unsolvable, redefine the conditions.\nWhy do you think there's only one body? My stage experiment proves Artemy Burakh can have several. Bodies die, the person remains.
6192355001586382 How?
6192355001586383 Like a photon piercing several holes at once, a person doesn't equal their physical shell. A person is… <i>distributed.</i>\nDistributed among many attempts, bodies, versions, interpretations.
6192355001586384 What photon?
6192355001586385 A particle. Small objects can be particles and waves at the same time.\nNext to catastrophic events, a person is a tiny particle, so that rule applies to them, too. They think they're a particle, but they're a wave.
6192355001586386 I think you should discuss that with Dankovsky…
6192355001586414 Goddamn it… Another applicant for this cursed role.
6192355001586415 Yeah, sign me up.
6192355001586416 Why is it cursed?
6192355001586417 I guess. But they're strictly forbidden to interact with them.\nThat'd ruin the whole experiment. The prototypes would learn they're being played, act unnaturally, aspire above their station… You know.
6192355001586418 Wait. The actor follows a set path, repeating the prototype's actions. Right?
6192355001586419 I understand, yeah.
6192355001586420 It's unwise to argue with madmen. So I nod in agreement.
6192355001586421 Right.
6192355001586422 So what happens when the actor surpasses the moment that the prototype died?
6192355001586423 Bravo.\nPerhaps that is the instant when their nature changes. The actor gets into the role so deeply, they become the original.\nIf charged particles can charge their nature, why wouldn't the same apply to the people charged with the same idea, dream, or bad fortune?
6192355001586424 Wait a second… Where's the real person, then?
6192355001586425 Yup. You're a certified madman.
6192355001586426 You've reached deeper into human nature than a surgeon…
6192355001586427 Why do you think there's only one, that they're limited by a single body?\nThis is the abyss we need to step over to reinvent death. That's how I see it.
6192355001586428 What's the abyss?
6192355001586429 It's perspective. You're mistaking a moth in a spider web on your window for a monster on the hill. Remember that story?
6192355001586430 I do.
6192355001586431 I don't.
6192355001586432 It <i>is</i> the monster.
6192355001586433 Because everyone fails. Sixteen failed attempts. Sixteen! They keep dying… meaning they never learn. Never understand what death is.
6192355001586434 What is there to understand?
6192355001586435 Don't give me that smirk… You think you're different?\nFine. Go ahead, prove it. Finish the play without dying. Become yourself.
6192355001586436 But there must be a real Burakh out there somewhere… Right?
6192355001586437 Thanks. I'll go now. The world has spoiled some more, I've become weaker, and so on, and so on, I know.
6192355001586438 Perhaps. But… unlikely. The real Burakh died not so long ago. Although…
6192355001586439 I've been wondering. If there are both actors and real people in the streets… can an actor meet their prototype?
6192355001586440 I know better than you if he died or not.
6192355001586441 I don't understand. Either we're doing great, or we're utterly failing. And it doesn't depend on me anymore. Only on you.
6192355001586442 You're a strange man, you know. Perhaps you set all this up deliberately?
6192355001586443 …Are you human?
6192355001586444 You're ascribing diabolical capabilities to me. Please give credit where it's due—which is to say, to yourself.\nI'm blameless. "All this," as you put it, started because of you, not me. I just took the chance to experiment in the heart of this… triumph of death.
6192355001586445 …Oh, so I'm at fault?
6192355001586446 Of course. You're a doctor. You could've prevented it, like your father did back then. But you haven't.\nWhich I deeply appreciate! Five years ago, it rang false precisely because there was no triumph of death. We didn't let it into the Town. No one was truly horrified. The actors didn't have time for realizations…
6192355001586447 A good actor doesn't need to be scared to act out horror convincingly.
6192355001586448 You truly are mad.
6192355001586449 But my actors are bad! Unprofessional amateurs. We're in a hellhole, remember? I mean, look at yourself! That's what I have to work with.\nI'd like to be omnipotent! But… I'm just an exhausted, desperate director. Nothing more.
6192355001586450 Seriously…?
6192355001587051 You solve your problems. I solve mine.
6192355001587052 It's an experiment, isn't it? So shut up and take it in stride.
6192355001587053 Can't you tell? If I weren't, I'd never be stuck in this hellhole…
6192355001587054 You set it all up. Why?
6192355001587055 Burakh. I, too, get exhausted running the same scene with you again and again. If you don't care about yourself, have mercy on me, at least.
6192355001587056 I'm not doing this on purpose…
6192355001587057 Isn't it supposed to be different each time?
6192355001587062 So that's one way to achieve immortality?
6192355001587063 What does that have to do with immortality? We're seeking transcendence, not immortality. You do understand it's not the same?
6192355001587064 I don't.
6192355001587065 I think Georgiy Kain said something to that extent…
6192355001587066 Oh, physics… Never thought you'd be interested in it.
6192355001587067 …And you've never seen me before. Yeah, I remember.
6192355001587069 I don't.
6192355001587074 A personality.
6192355001587075 A soul.
6192355001587076 Use yours, then.
6192355001587077 Gladly.
6192355001587078 What if I define a person as a body?
6192355001587079 This is too complicated for me.
6192355001587081 I was dead. Now I'm alive. Who are you to make me come back all the time? What kind of trickery is this?
6192355001587082 I bet I do.
6192355001587083 Why?
6192355001587084 What do you mean "why"? To finish the run, of course.
6192355001587085 That's not what I mean. Every time I come here, you say it gets harder.
6192355001587086 I'm same as before, though. I didn't die.
6192355001587087 What's the point of the run?
6192355001587090 I won't wish you luck… I don't believe in it.
6192355001587091 Good luck.
6192355001587092 When they get into character.
6192355001587093 When they sympathize with them. I read that in a book once.
6192355001587094 I'm leaving, then.
6192355001587095 I see.
6192355001587096 Not exactly.\nIn truth, they believe we must reevaluate death, and change our very perception of it. See it not as a universal law, but as a solvable problem.\nSome abysses can be crossed by building bridges, and so on.
6192355001587097 Yeah. Something about limits.
6192355001587098 In addition, when you cease to consider yourself as a person, as a name, as a body, you elude its impact. By measuring yourself not in names, but in attempts, you become invulnerable to death.
6192355001587099 So that's how death is defeated in your play?
6192355001587100 People overcome death by pushing the limits of self-understanding.\nSuch as the limits that make a person perceive themselves as a body, instead of a sum of knowledge connected through unique associations. Consider yourself as being more like a kaleidoscope, and your life will become… not compelling, exactly, but… <i>more.</i>
6192355001587101 I'm a surgeon. To me, living creatures <i>are</i> bodies.
6192355001587102 Well, how very sad for you. As long as you perceive yourself as a body, you will die over and over.\nIn our play, a living creature is made of many bodies at once. Which is what makes observing the sand pest so fascinating! Like any epidemic, it's structured according to the same principles.
6192355001587103 Oh. So you've noticed it, too.
6192355001587104 That's not important. What matters is that I overcome my finite nature by dividing myself, then creating connections within that new creature.\nWithout connections, everything is pointless. Like you all, with all your attempts. You're connected by playing the same role!
6192355001587105 Connections… Sure. Now I see.
6192355001587108 He didn't die, though. He dissolved into many living people.
6192355001587109 Getting closer to ritual cannibalism, I see.
6192355001587110 Come now. Don't take it so literally.\nThen again, so long as you equate a person with a body, cannibalism would remain your only way to overcome death. Absurd. False.
6192355001587111 Simon was not afraid of death. He accepted it.
6192355001587112 Are you sure you're a director? You sound like a priest.
6192355001587113 In that case, suicide would have been the best way to defeat death. But it's been scientifically proven that suicide is the shortest road to oblivion.\nDeath must be overcome, not rejected. This is not the way. If you think you can avoid burns by leaping into fire, you're sillier than I thought.
6192355001587114 Uh huh. You're clearly very intelligent, though.
6192355001587115 Like I'm the one burdening you with those rocks!
6192355001587116 Then who? Death itself? Teaching me to overcome it, to push limits?
6192355001587117 Death teaches nothing. It only waits. It's an abyss, without will.\nThe plague teaches. The Town teaches. <i>Conflict</i> is educational. Such was Simon and Isidor's plan.
6192355001587118 Why make it harder? What's the point?
6192355001587119 Wait. What plan?
6192355001587120 I can give you several answers. \nA) It's not up to me.\nB) I'm doing this to mess with you.\nC) It doesn't matter. What matters is how you profit from it.\nD) So that you'd stop dying and finish your damn role!\nWhich one do you choose? Go ahead.
6192355001587121 None. I'll keep walking along my path.
6192355001587122 None. I'll just start over. Consider me weak all you want.
6192355001587130 Dividing a person into a person and a person. Dividing a person into an assembly of separate—though connected—moments. Dividing a person into the sum of those who perceive and interpret their actions.\nDid I miss anything?
6192355001587131 You missed a lot, and not for the first time.
6192355001587137 You know… I'm beginning to enjoy it.
6192355001587138 I mean that the path has a clear direction, like a bridge over the abyss. The bridge is a line made of many segments. They overlap, ensuring its continuity and growth. The overlapping creates a single entity.
6192355001587139 A bridge, huh…
6192355001587140 We're in mourning today. Lost yet another one. I'm glad you came to replace them. Perhaps this time, we'll make more progress.
6192355001587141 Is it that important?
6192355001587142 Like… cutting them?
6192355001587143 A person splits into many versions of themselves. They are a sum. A sum of many attempts to overcome death, many versions of their path.\nI'm mostly curious about how this path is linear and nonlinear at the same time.
6192355001587144 And each version is a bit smarter than their predecessor, aren't they?
6192355001587145 Why?
6192355001587147 The abyss is endless. You'll build your bridge forever.
6192355001587148 If that's what you choose to think, you might as well leap right into the abyss. Me, I'd rather try.
6192355001587149 You know, I keep leaping, but nothing seems to work.
6192355001587150 Just saying.
6192355001589051 The Kains, too, love to blindly leap—into anything, anywhere, really, so long as they don't have to remain in one place.
6192355001589052 Well, what are the others? I don't like yours.
6192355001589053 I do measure myself as the sum of my deeds.
6192355001589054 …Yet your predecessors were all too eager to convince me they were Artemy Burakh. They got into the role the traditional way. They got too attached to the name.
6192355001589055 Consistency is not a bad thing. Don't try to manipulate me out of it.
6192355001589056 I didn't say anything like that, though.
6192355001589057 I don't want to listen to this. You're a madman. You're a spider, luring people into your web.
6192355001589058 I only have one answer to whatever you have to say: no.
6192355001589059 Oh. So the bridge thing was their term? I thought it sounded familiar.
6192355001589060 "A life that is more." A more direct life, a life <i>across…</i> 
6192355001589061 So you <i>like</i> the sand pest…
6192355001589062 I'm alone. I'm still alone.
6192355001589063 I wonder how you intend to do that.
6192355001589064 You'll see.
6192355001589065 An old trick. "Don't think of a polar bear." Wounding me with a word, like a splinter, so my mind would see confirmations everywhere?
6192355001589066 Exploring the limits of your actors once again?
6192355001589067 What? No. Nothing to explore there.\nLimits are supposed to be pushed, not explored. That's what I'm doing. I don't care about their exact nature.
6192355001589068 So you bind us tighter and tighter with all these additional conditions.
6192355001589069 That's true, I suppose…
6192355001589070 Can I just sit here for a while?
6192355001589071 No, it isn't.
6192355001589072 Am I supposed to stop fearing death?
6192355001589073 Not even remotely. How could you? Death is repulsive.\nWe're looking for a sustainable way to… step over it. Not even <i>run</i> from death—as you clearly know, that would fail. By the way, which attempt is this? Thirteen, isn't it?
6192355001589074 Then what? If I take risks and confront death head-on, all I get is another rock tied around my ankle! How is that logical?
6192355001589075 I don't know. I didn't count.
6192355001589076 No. <i>I</i> haven't died once.
6192355001589077 You just don't know what you want.
6192355001589078 Oops. Too early. The play itself isn't mine, haven't I mentioned? They wrote the script. I'm just an interpreter. A prompter.\nYou're Artemy Burakh, right? So follow your father's path. That's your Line for now. Your bridge over the abyss. Build it, and it'll all come together. Unless the rocks drag you down.
6192355001589079 Why have rocks at all, though? I don't understand.
6192355001589080 They… "wrote the script"? No. Father wouldn't have.
6192355001589084 Drivel. You're wrong.
6192355001589085 Then how do I profit from this?
6192355001589087 I guess I'm just the stupid performer… Time to try on the costume.
6192355001589088 I don't know. I just feel this way.\nTo overcome death, you must come in close contact with it. But you won't defeat it by climbing into its maw, nor by running. It's different.\nHow? I don't know! If I did, why bother with all this? You tell me: How?
6192355001589089 I don't know, either!
6192355001589090 Don't yell at me.
6192355001589091 I'll figure it out.
6192355001589092 After thinking about it, I agree about the contact.
6192355001589093 Our cells are constantly renewed. Bones, too—although slower. In ten years, my body won't have a single piece of the current me.
6192355001589094 What about mine?
6192355001589095 It's up to you.
6192355001589096 Same.
6192355001589097 Not yours. Because you're not human.
6192355001589098 I guess not. It's your play, after all. It has nothing to do with real life.
6192355001589099 Still, I think the experiment was a success.
6192355001589100 What makes you think so?
6192355001589101 No.
6192355001589102 Tell that to the families of the victims.
6192355001589103 I just do. I'm neither philosopher nor scientist. I am, as one rude person has once put it, a clown. What is there to demand from a clown? \nBut I sense it was a success. Death is powerless when viewed like this.
6192355001589104 It's not about dividing a person; it's about the connections between the divided parts, and how new pieces grow from the old.
6192355001589105 Wise. That answer is very much yours. What will continue you?
6192355001589106 My children.
6192355001589107 Should I lend you a revolver, then? Think of death the way you just described, press it to your temple, and pull the trigger. I'll watch and write the clinical report.
6192355001589108 The ones who trust me.
6192355001589109 The thing I love.
6192355001589110 The ones who love me.
6192355001589111 My town.
6192355001589112 My people.
6192355001589113 My character.
6192355001589114 Earth.
6192355001589115 None of your business.
6192355001589116 Connections, then?
6192355001589117 You and I understand the word differently, though.
6192355001589118 Yes. Connections.
6192355001589119 The Lines, if you will.
6192355001589120 Associations, if you prefer the term.
6192355001589351 My Half chose me when I was three. It's their choice, not ours.
6192355001589352 And what is your Half? A little grass snake?
6192355001589353 Fair enough. Thanks for the pills.
6192355001589354 A chaffinch. Only I haven't seen her in a year.
6192355001589355 She's just shy.
6192355001589356 Don't worry. She'll show herself.
6192355001589357 Aren't you a bit too young to play in the Warehouses?
6192355001589358 He's not a scout. He's an aide. I mean, I can't just expel him, can I? But we don't let the little ones anywhere dangerous.
6192355001589359 Says the big one.
6192355001589360 Let's say I believed you.
6192355001589361 Look who's talking.
6192355001589362 Don't talk back to me.
6192355001589363 Anyway. You gave the right order.
6192355001591251 There are three doctors in town. Dankovsky, a theorist; a girl who performs miracles; and me, a surgeon. That's all.
6192355001591252 I'm not sure… but it comes from below the ground.
6192355001591253 Explain.
6192355001591254 …I can't. I don't know. I'm not yet sure that my eyes haven't deceived me.
6192355001591256 Those aren't tall tales!
6192355001591257 I have a sample.
6192355001591258 How much?
6192355001591259 How much blood do I have? Too little.
6192355001591260 A droplet.
6192355001591261 What does that mean?
6192355001591262 …I haven't really figured it out myself yet.
6192355001591263 I don't know.
6192355001591268 I know where to look… but I don't yet understand how it will help.
6192355001591951 That's not what you said about Grace. With her, you specifically asked for my help.
6192355001591952 Yes… but that was different. That was about her alone. Now I'm speaking of all our children, the whole <i>tagloor.</i> I sense you won't be able to protect them.
6192355001591953 You might be right, but what can be done?
6192355001591954 I will. I'll guard them with my life.
6192355001591955 So… there's no need for me to hurry and help Grace? You'll manage that on your own? And cure the sick, too?
6192355001591956 …There's no need to be like that. You know that's not what I meant.
6192355001591957 What did you mean, then?
6192355001591958 When… when <i>the</i> trouble comes for them, let me be the one to shield them. Not you. All right? I'll speak to it myself.
6192355001591959 Speak to <i>what?</i> Victoria, there's an outbreak! To save anyone, I need to work, to make the cure—not argue abstract ideas.
6192355001591960 Rain at seven, fine at eleven.
6192355001591961 It doesn't ask who it should visit.
6192355001591962 Have you made it already, then? Or are you like that fancy big-city doctor, claiming that all we need for salvation is chemistry?\nHe's a nonbeliever. But you're a better man. You know the world is more complicated than that. So believe <i>me!</i>
6192355001591963 Believe what?
6192355001591965 I've had enough of this nonsense. Everyone who entrusted their lives to me remains under my protection. Including you.
6192355001591966 I hope we never get a chance to find out.
6192355001591967 If… if I had let you take them away from me back then, would it have turned out differently?
6192355001591968 I don't know. I can't see anything now…
6192355001591969 Damn it… Damn it!
6192355001591970 It's all right. I can. I see a long and happy life ahead of you.
6192355001591973 Andrey is dead, too. I'm sorry.
6192355001591974 Oh… there's no need then. Peter will give it to his brother himself…
6192355001591975 I'm sorry.
6192355001591976 He will. They're inseparable even in death.
6192355001591977 What do you want from half a man?
6192355001591978 I wanted to give you this key.
6192355001591979 Nothing. I just wanted to… ah, forget it.
6192355001591980 What's this?
6192355001591981 I don't know.
6192355001591982 It's Peter's. A girl gave it to me… She must have found it among his things.
6192355001591983 A secret.
6192355001591984 ……
6192355001591985 What does this key open?
6192355001591986 I'm sorry.
6192355001591987 A girl lives at his place now… but I'll take care of her myself. Don't worry.
6192355001591988 …
6192355001591989 Shut up.
6192355001591990 …
6192355001591991 Don't be rude.
6192355001591992 Thank you. And shut up! Shove your condolences up your ass. I despise insincerity.\nI understand now. He knew everything. All these years. It's surreal…\nThank you. Now go.
6192355001591993 Will you tell me what this is all about?
6192355001591994 My condolences are sincere.
6192355001591995 No.
6192355001591996 Fair enough. I won't pry.
6192355001591997 You know, that girl… Grace. She can touch the dead with her mind. If the grief becomes unbearable, you may consider paying her a visit.
6192355001591998 Remember how we went to the House of Death? It did protect a district from infection… Turns out you were right.
6192355001592000 We knew what Lika deserved. We'd spare him anyway, I think.\nBut you said the right thing back then. Changed our lives. Killing is never acceptable. Ever.
6192355001592001 Ever.
6192355001592002 If only I followed this rule myself…
6192355001592003 So I'll make sure you live too. Got it?
6192355001592004 Khan is dead. He got infected—not today, earlier… because of me.
6192355001592005 The liquid kind?
6192355001592006 Protect her.
6192355001592007 …That's your impression? No one's ever called me that.
6192355001592008 You've never spoken to an inquisitor before.
6192355001592009 Fair enough.
6192355001592010 What makes you say that?
6192355001592011 It's obvious.
6192355001592012 You inquisitors are strange.
6192355001592013 Well, you guessed right.
6192355001592016 I'm listening.
6192355001592017 You're not planning to give me orders?
6192355001592018 No, doctor. \nAre you a courier? An aide? An assistant? A secretary? Or else did you assume I'd point you to one location with all the answers, and all you'd have to do is stroll over there?
6192355001592020 I don't need you today, doctor.
6192355001592021 Oh… but you told me to report to you daily.
6192355001592022 I'm talking to someone else now. Haven't you noticed? He's there in the corner.
6192355001592023 I haven't.
6192355001592024 Or do you have something to report? Have you made any progress in your search?
6192355001592025 Maybe you could advise me?
6192355001592026 What…from here?
6192355001592027 I have made progress.
6192355001592028 You're an inquisitor. You know more than I do. Maybe you've found a lead.
6192355001592029 Those who can only follow crosses on a map have already received my orders. They're of no interest to me. And they won't solve our problem.\nI'm relying on those who can think for themselves. Don't disappoint me.
6192355001592030 The cross is the Abattoir, but I don't know how to get inside.
6192355001592031 I've made progress.
6192355001592032 I didn't say that.
6192355001592033 I'm not free, I'm confused. And unsure what to do.
6192355001592034 Are we solving the same problem, I wonder?
6192355001592036 I'll try.
6192355001592038 Report.
6192355001592039 Oyun, the Foreman of the Abattoir, is back from the steppe. He might know something.
6192355001592040 I think I should look into the Abattoir…
6192355001592041 Your Oyun knows nothing. He tried to find those… brontosauruses of yours in the steppe, only to learn they're extinct. Any more bright ideas?
6192355001592042 I need to go to the Abattoir. I've always wanted to.
6192355001592043 Do you know what you'd be looking for? Or is it just a shot in the dark?
6192355001592044 A shot in the dark.
6192355001592045 I'm relying on Oyun. He promised to find out…
6192355001592046 We have no time for hope and luck, Burakh! No time at all!
6192355001592047 Then tell me what to do.
6192355001592048 I know.
6192355001592050 I've made some progress.
6192355001592451 Not yet.
6192355001592452 I'm not saying anything.
6192355001592453 I've made some progress.
6192355001592472 Did you really ascend the Polyhedron yesterday?
6192355001592473 No. I studied its base. Collected information. Interrogated people.\nWould you like a written report?
6192355001592474 You should climb it one day. The sky above is very special.
6192355001592475 If I say yes, would you draw one up?
6192355001592477 What does the Tower have to do with the First Outbreak?
6192355001592480 Khan is alive. I'll drag him out in the end.
6192355001592751 I'm glad you're alive too.
6192355001592752 I hope you're right.
6192355001592755 So you wouldn't come after us.
6192355001592756 …I'm stunned by your logic. And where are you? Where's that place I'm not supposed to follow you to?
6192355001592758 "Completely"? That's uncanny…
6192355001592759 The "Rose"?
6192355001592760 The Polyhedron. The Tower. The Wind Rose.
6192355001592761 Like hell it'll protect you if you keep running across infected districts.
6192355001592762 The general believed you? General Block? No way.
6192355001592763 Yes.
6192355001592764 You're mad… but there is a way.
6192355001594753 If there is a bombardment, we're all doomed anyway.
6192355001594754 True… now let me talk to the others.
6192355001594755 Mature reasoning.
6192355001594756 You were so worried about safety… but now you're back. Changed your mind?
6192355001594757 The district below is infected. Anyone sick among you?
6192355001594758 Don't talk about Khan like that. He's alive.
6192355001594759 Yes. For now. But he's sick. He must not get close to children. Not here.
6192355001594760 I'll cure him.
6192355001594761 He's still a child himself. Both of you are.
6192355001594762 Won't it topple over? There are a lot of children in the Town…
6192355001594763 Will you be happy in there?
6192355001594764 The Polyhedron is all smoke and mirrors. A giant soap bubble. I hate it… \nBut my feelings matter very little now. The plague can't get inside—that's a fact. It will offer protection. You, on the other hand, have just crossed an infected district. So I won't let you near the children. They're my responsibility.
6192355001594765 What are you doing, Victoria…?
6192355001594766 Is there no other shelter?
6192355001594767 Are the graves overflowing?
6192355001594768 Do they hurt…?
6192355001594769 Well, those horrors have visited us as well… but I'd rather not tell you about it.
6192355001594770 They don't burn us, only smother.
6192355001594771 They'll have to manage. I'll find a way to take you away from here.
6192355001594772 Are you sure that's a good idea?
6192355001594773 Glad to hear it.
6192355001594774 Of course. Is there any doubt?
6192355001594775 Grace is an unusual girl. She has different needs than other kids.
6192355001594776 She's a neurotic kid. Moving her to a different place could traumatize her.
6192355001594777 The townsfolk respect her. If Grace were removed from the cemetery, chaos could ensue. And that's the last thing we want now.
6192355001594778 She belongs here.
6192355001594779 I always have doubt…
6192355001594780 Oh, come to your senses, Doctor Burakh! Do you even know the girl's name?
6192355001594781 It's Grace…
6192355001594782 What is it?
6192355001594783 "Grace" is just a nickname. She's nameless. She has no documents… Her father and mother were twyrine drunks, they never bothered.\nShe can't read or write. Eats whatever she picks off the ground. She's living like a weed!
6192355001594784 Why call her a "weed"? Precious herbs grow in the cemetery, too.
6192355001594785 There are lots of orphans and urchins in our Town. What's one more?
6192355001594786 But what if she likes it this way?
6192355001594787 You're right… I don't know what got into me.
6192355001594788 What will become of her when she grows up? Or—oh, this is simpler—in winter, when it drops below <i>zero?</i>\nHere, the only path ahead of her is one that leads right down into graveyard soil.
6192355001594789 You're right.
6192355001594792 There's nothing wrong with soil. Leave Grace alone.
6192355001594793 Thanks, I guess.
6192355001594794 Survivor
6192355001594795 I'll need a weapon.
6192355001594798 Biscuit brought pups. One was stillborn, but the rest are doing great.
6192355001594799 Sounds good.
6192355001594802 So those are the candy wrappers my Fellow Traveler was selling…
6192355001594803 Candy wrappers? Actual candy wrappers… Huh.
6192355001594804 Are you gonna take today's map of infected districts?
6192355001594805 You're on it again!
6192355001594806 No.
6192355001594807 I don't like this...
6192355001594808 Not right now. I'll drop by later. I guess.
6192355001594809 Without Rubin, this place is a circus…
6192355001594810 You're late!
6192355001594811 You do that. I need a breath of fresh air…
6192355001594812 Perhaps there is a reseller skulking in some shadows… Profiteers have no good conscience. Only, I don't want anything to do with it!
6192355001594813 A reseller, huh…
6192355001594814 Fine, fine. Just don't bite my head off.
6192355001594815 What pack…? You mistook me for someone.
6192355001594816 But your leader is dead…
6192355001594817 Yeah…\nBut the Tower still stands. Ishka is in charge now.
6192355001594818 I'm sorry.
6192355001594819 Notkin's Soul-and-a-Halves. How in the world did you miss them? They ramble about you all the time…
6192355001594820 That's a different gang of children, isn't it?
6192355001594821 I'm not interested in your games.
6192355001594822 No. And I never had one.
6192355001594823 Welp, then you won't have it in the future, either.\nGuess you missed your chance to befriend the Soul-and-a-Halves, doctor. Now you won't be able to betray them and switch to my side.\nWhat a goof! Forget it. I'll look elsewhere.
6192355001594824 What a horrible turn of events.
6192355001594825 I'll think about it.
6192355001594826 I don't play your games.
6192355001594827 The sound was coming from this room.
6192355001594828 Not you.
6192355001594829 Well, I've removed the boards. You're free to go.
6192355001594830 This town wasn't this absurd before.

6192355001599551 Where one fingernail was used, now two are needed. We won't accept you in our boats for one anymore.
6192355001599552 Why?
6192355001599553 I never expected you of all people to profiteer…
6192355001599554 You're exaggerating.
6192355001599561 I came here to talk to you on Sahba's behalf, yargachin. I am her rough hand, her wise heart, her heavy word.
6192355001599562 Sahba? Who is that?
6192355001599563 Why hasn't she come herself?
6192355001599564 She's in her hut. The plague speaks to her. She was waiting for you here, but you took too long to come.
6192355001599565 I was busy.
6192355001599566 Sahba Usp'tae. Aspity. Our leader. Our protector. Our teacher. She loved your father, yargachin.
6192355001599567 Why hasn't she come herself?
6192355001599568 I'm listening.
6192355001599569 Wow…
6192355001599570 Somehow, I felt like this disease couldn't touch her.
6192355001599571 Sahba would have said many words, wise words. I am bad at speech. My words are simple.\nYou have come into your father's inheritance. You are a menkhu. The Kin acknowledge you as a Burakh.
6192355001599572 I don't need your acknowledgment. I <i>am</i> a Burakh.
6192355001599573 This is what matters.
6192355001599574 I don't need your acknowledgment. I <i>am</i> a Burakh.
6192355001599575 This is what matters.
6192355001599576 Do you want me to fix your lamp?
6192355001599577 They put her six feet under, but no one knows where. You don't know, either?
6192355001599578 I don't.
6192355001599579 Why do you ask me?
6192355001599580 Not you. The Kin.
6192355001599581 You're standing in Sahba's place.
6192355001599582 I don't know. He hardly expected things to go south so quickly… and I don't think he knew about the plague. Only, what does it matter now?
6192355001599583 Nothing.
6192355001599585 His intentions still matter.
6192355001599586 I'll take care of him myself. Cure him. Don't worry.
6192355001599587 Just don't get too close to him, all right? He can hear your lullaby from afar just fine.
6192355001599588 It already has come. It's too late for psalms now.
6192355001599589 Anything untouched by infected hands!
6192355001601451 It's the other way round. The steppe people despise cremation.
6192355001601452 Any trickle of blood seeps from Olonngo. From the Abattoir. Always. Blood means the Abattoir.
6192355001601453 Then I need to go there.
6192355001601454 All right. I'm ready to go.
6192355001601455 You're too rash, emshen. Too hasty. I'm standing right in front of you—I can tell you haven't opened the udkhar properly, haven't touched the items inside.
6192355001601456 I won't understand anything without your help, anyway.
6192355001601457 I'm sorry.
6192355001601458 Do you need your hand held, like a child? Is that the Line a Burakh follows?\nFine. If you don't want to touch it, then listen. In the udkhar, that is now yours, are several blades of various herbs and a piece of paper. On that piece, there's a list of names. I haven't touched it with my eyes.
6192355001601459 Why has Father left me herbs?
6192355001601460 Please read the list now. What are those names?
6192355001601490 Hey, noukherne! Be khara, you are a good man. Buy my bull.
6192355001601491 Bayarlaa, noukherne. How much do you want for it?
6192355001601492 Why would I want a bull?
6192355001601493 It's as good as free. Three hundred.
6192355001601494 Cheap indeed. Is it stolen?
6192355001601495 I don't have that much.
6192355001601496 It's not just any bull. It brings luck. When the time comes, it'll tell you what to do.
6192355001601497 Can it talk then?
6192355001601498 Forget bulls! Be khara, you could be an air seller.
6192355001601499 You offend me, Khatangher. Not stolen; it's just that money is needed more than bulls these days.
6192355001601500 How come?
6192355001601501 Unente, it is known: It will talk on the scariest day of your life, showing you the right way.\nEh, kharaldaa, I'd rather not have it at all. Perhaps there won't be a scary day in my life, then.
6192355001601502 That's some funny logic, like you're starting to believe your own tall tale. The scary day will come whether you have a bull or not. It's not his life, but yours.
6192355001601503 To be honest, I think you're just a swindler, noukherne.
6192355001601504 So you're selling a curse on four legs? Sweet. I'll take if from you if <i>you</i> pay <i>me.</i>
6192355001601505 Take him for two hundred. It's a good bull. Be khara, it'll be useful to you.
6192355001601506 You're out of your mind, Khatangher. Find yourself another fool.
6192355001601507 All right, have it your way. I'll buy it.
6192355001601512 I'm leaving the Town, forever. Can't take him with me. It hurts me to sell him, but I don't have a choice. Buy my bull, kholboön!
6192355001601513 What's so special about it?
6192355001601518 What's so special about your bull?
6192355001601519 I'd buy it, but I don't have the money on me. Can you wait here?
6192355001601520 No, khayaala. I can't wait. Guess it's not in the cards then.
6192355001601521 Guess it's not.
6192355001601522 That's all right. You'll find another buyer for your treasure.
6192355001601523 I'd buy it, but I don't have the money on me. Can you wait here?
6192355001601524 Now, that's news. What's going on? Why is the area locked off?
6192355001601525 People say, something happened at the Factory. Like… an emission. Toxic soot in the air. Makes your eyes water in a minute… wouldn't be smart to go in without protection.
6192355001601526 And what does your beloved Dankovsky say?
6192355001601527 What kind of protection?
6192355001601528 He says, "The district is locked down and off limits to anyone but doctors. Vorakh allowed."
6192355001601529 <i>Burakh.</i> He sure has memory issues, doesn't he?
6192355001601530 So do I just walk into the soot? Just like that?
6192355001601531 Come on, take the pills. Here, a handful, for everything. Just make sure you figure out which one to give him, all right? The correct one will probably do the trick?
6192355001601532 Hand them over, I'll take a look.
6192355001601533 Not every condition can be cured with a pill.
6192355001601534 Diagnostics is a finicky process… but I'll try.
6192355001601535 I'm sorry I haven't helped, kid. I failed you.
6192355001601536 Can't be helped now… The big-city dandy said from the start that Patches was doomed. Guess he was right.
6192355001601537 I wanted to help you. I really did. Just… didn't work out.
6192355001601539 So you still trust me?
6192355001601540 We've met already! Have you drunk yourself amnesiac?
6192355001601541 And one more thing. The plague moves stealthily—it has no need to speak of its arrival in a place.\nWhen plague's by windows, people are at risk. But on the morrow other districts will be touched, and you must find them out yourself. So watch the Town's condition close, Burakh.
6192355001601542 It's not dice then, it's hide-and-seek.
6192355001601543 I hope there's less of it tomorrow.

6192355001606452 
6192355001606453 
6192355001608151 I think it's time to pay a visit to the Lair.
6192355001608152 Is Notkin in trouble? Not him…
6192355001608153 Young Vlad wants to see me.
6192355001608154 The blood for the panacea is underground. The whole Town stands on blood… How do I acquire it?
6192355001609151 I don't suppose I'll ever find out what Rubin made his cure from. But strange blood seeps from the ground by the Ear.\n\nShekhen. The Ear is in Shekhen.
6192355001609551 So Rubin's not at home, either. Not unexpected.\n\nGuess I'll have to ask the sly one, who is supposedly aware of everyone's comings and goings…
6192355001611151 "A." Nothing here is up to you, you clown…
6192355001611152 "B," of course. I knew it from the start. All this talk about death is just the raving of a power-mad insect. You're the insect.
6192355001611153 I know how I profit from this. One must be tough enough to withstand death's proximity if they are to face it often. That's the only way, isn't it?
6192355001611154 It's probably "C"... "Death is overcome through the force of spirit." "The braver the opponent, the more seriously death takes them." Something lofty like that?
6192355001611155 You're flattering me, sir, by speaking about me and not yourself. You think I'm important here?
6192355001611156 I think that's what you think.
6192355001611157 You're not.
6192355001611162 Some people here have no hands at all.
6192355001611163 I'm a decent doctor.
6192355001612051 Empty. Good. Let the dead take care of themselves.
6192355001612052 The Olgimskys' mansion stands empty now. The Kin has no more masters.
6192355001612053 Truly vacant now. No one shall disturb the depths anymore.
6192355001612054 
6192355001612055 The Olgimskys' mansion. Big Vlad is no more. Now his son lives here, dreaming of a better fate.
6192355001612056 Sometimes people who've lost their homes to the outbreak find shelter here. Such was Gravel's last request.
6192355001612057 My father's house. My house. I've no intention to live here.

6192355001613554 Eva Yan
6192355001625952 I tried to help Rubin, but it wasn't enough.\n\nWho killed him? The Kin, who spilled no blood? His conscience, which could never find peace? The friend, who failed in his task, my task?\n\nIt doesn't matter, I suppose. In the end, Stakh is dead.
6192355001627654 
6192355001628051 I came to pay my last respects to your father. Don't force me out.
6192355001628052 Did you know him?
6192355001628053 Who am I to force you out?
6192355001628054 You'll just crawl back in anyway.
6192355001628055 I didn't. He was already dead when I arrived.
6192355001628056 So you're just doing it for appearances.
6192355001628057 Why did you come, then?
6192355001628058 I talk to people a lot. And they said a lot of good things about your father.\nTalking to people is my greatest skill, you know. They open up. And turn from puppets to—
6192355001628059 —independent people?
6192355001628060 —actual living humans?
6192355001628061 Are you going to live here now?
6192355001628062 Not right now. I don't want to sleep where blood was spilled.
6192355001628063 No. This house is unclean.
6192355001628064 Live here yourself, if you want.
6192355001628065 I want to understand him.
6192355001628066 Why?

6192355001630663 "I, Lara Ravel, conceived the murder of General Block alone. No one knew of my plans. If anyone called Rubin, Burakh, or Filin claims to be my accomplice, disregard them. I've done it myself."

6192355001630714 Farewell Letter
6192355001630715 A crumpled piece of paper. Smells like a marsh, for some reason. Touch to read it.
6192355001630716 "Who can tally the number of drops in the sea?\nWho can tally the number of tears in this grief? \n\nI'm so happy it wasn't you, Father.\n\n-Veronica Croy."
6192355001630717 
6192355001630718 
6192355001630719 Key With No Lock
6192355001630720 It's a secret. It has "F." scratched on it.
6192355001630721 Small. It's a key to a box or a drawer, not a door. It reflects light at odd angles.
6192355001630722 
6192355001630723 "Dragonfly Eye"
6192355001630724 An incredibly rare concoction made of twyre berries. When consumed, it reveals several points of interest in the Town.
6192355001630725 Twyre berries are rarely picked. Few people ever see this potion. Perhaps fate is thanking me for lending someone assistance in the past?
6192355001630726 
6192355001630727 Old "Shmowder"
6192355001630728 I suspect I know what it does. Better keep it in case times get rough.
6192355001630729 This "shmowder" is very old, made ten years ago, or even more. It's imbued with warm gratitude.
6192355001630730 
6192355001637551 An old steppe village. Alive once again.
6192355001637552 I came into my legacy… sort of. I traced Father's path. I will take care of his patients. I've proven by deeds that I know the Lines.\n\nI still can't believe the "shmowder" helped. I don't think I'll be this lucky in the future.\n\nBut everyone considers me a menkhu now.
6192355001638951 So... I'll have to work right here? On the stage?
6192355001638952 Same as everyone, sir. Same as everyone.
6192355001638953 All right. What do I need to know?
6192355001638955 No. Keep it.
6192355001638956 It's a good gun, I suppose. Never checked. I only carried it for show. So they'd fear me...\nThat's how it works, y'know. They won't try anythin' as long as they're afraid. Won't get cocky, won't make you rein them in. Won't make you use the gun...
6192355001638957 Sly. And even noble, in a way.
6192355001638958 ...But they've lost fear.
6192355001638959 Grief, you're a moron! Carrying a shotgun "for show", really...
6192355001638960 Let's assume he did. How do I examine one?
6192355001638961 Are <i>you</i> asking <i>me,</i> doctor?\nI guess you take a sample. Then... hold it to the light? Taste it? And run to professor Dankovsky to report if anything is off.
6192355001638962 Could you drag a barrel to a different location for me? It'd be easier to check there. And I don't think I can move a barrel on my own...
6192355001638963 Already running. At breakneck speed.
6192355001638964 Why? Examine it here. Unless you find a suspicious barrel... then experiments are mandatory, I guess?
6192355001638965 So you would relocate a suspicious one? Got it.
6192355001638966 I'll inspect barrels first. decide later.
6192355001638967 I have a bad feeling about this...
6192355001638968 How did they let you in here with a gun?
6192355001638969 It has no ammo. And, well...
6192355001638970 What?
6192355001638971 Well?
6192355001638972 Put him in prison. Let him stay there. It's safer that way.
6192355001638973 It's not him. I'm sure of it. You can release him now.
6192355001638974 That, Burakh, is ultimately not your decision. I only wanted your opinion. I will do with him as I see fit.
6192355001638975 Very well.
6192355001638976 I'll find the murderer myself, Governor. I trust myself more.
6192355001638977 Then my opinion is this: Prison's no place for an innocent man.
6192355001638979 I already have.
6192355001638980 Don't. It wasn't him. We've talked.
6192355001638981 You know what... have this gun. It's of no use to me anymore, and you seem to be fast on the draw.
6192355001638982 Is this... a shotgun? And here I thought you weren't a murderer after all.
6192355001638983 How did they let you in here with a gun?
6192355001638985 What do you mean, "no use"? I don't like the look on your mug. Keep it.
6192355001638986 It's a good gun, I suppose. Never checked. I only carried it for show. So they'd fear me...\nThat's how it works, y'know. They won't try anythin' as long as they're afraid. Won't get cocky, won't make you rein them in. Won't make you use the gun...
6192355001638987 Sly. And even noble, in a way.
6192355001638988 ...But they've lost fear.
6192355001638989 Grief, you're a moron! Carrying a shotgun "for show", really...
6192355001638990 It has no ammo. And, well...
6192355001638991 What?
6192355001638994 Dead? But how? I've cured him, I saw him get better with my own eyes!
6192355001638995 What cure did you use?\nClara says, the thing you gave him gnawed at him from the inside, so his organism just gave. He was very weak... "Some medicine is worse than poison," she said.
6192355001638996 Damn these shmowders...
6192355001638997 Clara says a lot of things.
6192355001638998 Yeah… figured that out already.
6192355001638999 I see… good that I left her be, then.
6192355001639002 Give me a minute.

6192355001646951 I can buy a toolkit here.\n\n…Or I can distract the merchant with conversation, so Sticky has enough time to rob the shop—free of charge.
6192355001647051 How do wrong pills help? They don't reduce infection.
6192355001647052 I see. What else is rewarded?
6192355001647053 They provide care and hope. It's not just the plague that's killing the Town, but the panic, too. If your pill doesn't help with the former, at least it alleviates the latter somewhat...\nAlthough correctly administered antibiotics will be rewarded more generously.
6192355001647054 Got it. What else is rewarded?
6192355001647055 Assisting Bachelor Dankovsky, of course.
6192355001647056 I knew it! Everything has to be about him, doesn't it?
6192355001647057 Great. What about the deranged girl? Am I supposed to assist her too?
6192355001647058 So one is free to loot the districts abandoned by the plague? That's useful to know.
6192355001647059 Useful how? What are you up to?
6192355001647060 Nothing. So there are looters in Father's house, huh?
6192355001647061 A shameless doctor is more useful than a dead one.
6192355001647062 I've heard what the little morons are up to… If only they washed their hands half as eagerly as they draw maps!
6192355001647063 I already know… They were looking for trouble and found it. Paid for it with their leader's life. Come on. We need to get back to work.
6192355001647064 I don't know... Come on, turn that frown upside down! Just pay more attention to the people in your care. \nLike Sticky... I thought we'd meet here. Like we did at your place. But I can't find him...
6192355001647065 Damn...
6192355001647066 You'll find him, kid. I swear.
6192355001647067 He has.
6192355001647068 So?
6192355001647069 Perhaps it would be smart of you to take some interest? Seeing how they're taking interest in your hide.
6192355001647070 Where are you taking them? Answer me, you ghoul!
6192355001647071 He mentioned a riot brewing there...
6192355001647073 You said the Termitary was locked because of a riot. Was that a lie?
6192355001647074 You said the Termitary was locked because of a riot. Was that a lie?
6192355001647076 That look on your face... I don't like it.
6192355001647077 Did those six years of study go over your head completely? "Infected" and "healthy" are just words. But everything is interconnected in a body.\nA healthy organ might be showing first signs of infection. Conversely, it might already have developed antibodies…
6192355001647078 You're right. Everything is connected in a body; all three Layers.
6192355001647079 I doubt we're capable of examining anything at this level without a real lab…
6192355001647080 I haven't graduated.

6192355001648254 Taya's Throne
6192355001648255 Soon, the most luxurious yurt our town has ever seen will be built here.
6192355001649951 
6192355001651751 Yes… I've seen your Reflection.
6192355001651752 It sucks without the chief. Some folks have already scattered... you know how it goes. Jester yowls at night...\nBut the scouts are still going strong. And I won't leave for the Tower either. Screw it.
6192355001651753 So you didn't replace Notkin with another leader?
6192355001651754 Why?
6192355001651755 I'm sorry...
6192355001651758 No.
6192355001651759 I respect that.
6192355001651760 You should have.
6192355001651761 Why won't you go to the Tower?
6192355001651762 Eh... I've been there. The Tower makes everything too easy. Any dream, any fantasy—you name it. It's like living on candy. One needs soup, too...\nDown here is where life is.
6192355001651763 Impressively reasonable.
6192355001651764 Down here is where death is.
6192355001651765 They why are you so gloomy?
6192355001651766 Father vaccinated the town? What are you talking about?
6192355001651767 Oh, so you haven't figured it out? Well... I suppose it's fair. The past is a complicated material, capricious and hard to bend. Not all people know how to work with it—and uncover it.\nWe will not talk of this matter.
6192355001651768 Is your Polyhedron a thing of the past, too?
6192355001651769 Yeah... it's my own fault. I failed to do everything.
6192355001651770 In that case, go to hell.
6192355001651771 They're dead. I don't want to talk about it.
6192355001651772 I am alive.
6192355001651773 Yes. You're alive.
6192355001651774 So is the Town.
6192355001651775 You understood nothing, Kindred. You've failed to reach the Kin's heart. Failed to brave its depths, touch the shared pulse... you've abandoned your quest half-way.
6192355001651776 Say it straight: failed to find out who killed Father.
6192355001651777 I didn't have the time. I was trying to save the children.
6192355001651778 Their heart was too hard to reach. I got confused.
6192355001651779 Wrong. I've touched the heart of the udurgh.
6192355001651780 That's not what I'm talking about. I meant the people. You've failed to blend in and merge with us.
6192355001651781 I never wanted to merge with the Kin.
6192355001651782 I had no time.
6192355001651783 How will you live now, Kindred?
6192355001651784 What about you?
6192355001651785 On my own.
6192355001651788 So who killed Father?
6192355001651789 No, Kindred. Ask no questions.\nPerhaps in another life it would all have gone differently. And we'd have a different conversation. But now... leave me. Your town waits for you.
6192355001651790 I grieve for the Earth too... Kindred.
6192355001651791 But we only have one life.
6192355001652959 I am alive.
6192355001652960 Yes. You're alive.
6192355001652961 Everything is alive now...
6192355001652962 You understood nothing, Kindred. You've failed to reach the Kin's heart. Failed to brave its depths, touch the shared pulse... you've abandoned your quest half-way.
6192355001652963 Wrong. I've touched the heart of the udurgh.
6192355001652964 Say it straight: failed to find out who killed Father.
6192355001652965 I didn't have the time. I was trying to save the children.
6192355001652966 Their heart was too hard to reach. I got confused.
6192355001652967 That's not what I'm talking about. I meant the people. You've failed to blend in and merge with us.
6192355001652968 I never wanted to merge with the Kin.
6192355001652969 I had no time.
6192355001652970 How will you live now, Kindred?
6192355001652971 What about you?
6192355001652972 So who killed Father?
6192355001652973 Alongside everything else. Everything is alive now... madness.
6192355001652974 No, Kindred. Ask no questions.\nPerhaps, in another life it would all have gone differently. And we'd have a different conversation. But now... leave me.
6192355001652975 See you soon... Kindred.
6192355001652976 But we only have one life.
6192355001652977 You are triumphant now, Kindred. Yet time will pass… and you will find yourself upturned. What was once atop the wheel, will find itself dragged down. You'll see. Tiimel dee.
6192355001652978 I'm leaving you here, Foreman of the Abattoir.
6192355001652979 Baarhani, baarhani…
6192355001652980 I'm not triumphant. Not at all.
6192355001652981 I wish they wouldn't have stayed… leaving was safer.
6192355001652982 There's no one to check on.
6192355001652985 Not yet.
6192355001652986 You're right. I know what to do. And for that, I need to find a courier carrying orders from the inquisitor. Have you seen him?
6192355001652987 No. Now is not the time to discuss feeling. Tell me, have you seen a courier carrying papers to the general?
6192355001652988 I... I can't put it into words. Perhaps you can do it better?
6192355001652989 I was doing everything wrong all these days, you see. As if hoping for a miracle...
6192355001652990 The truth is, a choice will have to be made—whether I want it or not. Have you seen a courier carrying papers around?
6192355001652991 No. We must save ourselves—by acting. It's clear to me now. Have you seen a courier with papers around?
6192355001652992 The general said you've changed his mind... did you hypnotize him or something?
6192355001652993 That was one compelling discussion of war, then.
6192355001652994 Are you here on business, or what?
6192355001652995 I am.
6192355001652996 What has she done to you? I can't believe my ears…
6192355001652997 He looks transfixed... are you hypnotizing him? How did they even let you in?
6192355001652998 You'll have to bear with me some more. I need to talk to him, too.
6192355001652999 You're not the only salvation.
6192355001653000 And you said you were no shapeshifter. Said you were good!
6192355001653001 Calm down, will you? If I decide there is reason to worry, I'll hurry to Dankovsky with a sample of water instead of chatting with you.
6192355001653002 There's no point in trying any further options.
6192355001653003 There's no point in trying any further options.
6192355001653004 There's no point in trying any further options.
6192355001653005 There's no point in trying any further options.
6192355001653006 There's no point in trying any further options.
6192355001653007 Another family torn apart...
6192355001653008 I know. We've met already.
6192355001653009 No, kid. It wasn't that. But Notkin's better now.
6192355001653451 Chief Notkin's pack nest here. I can barter with them for a map of infected districts.
6192355001653551 
6192355001653552 
6192355001653553 
6192355001653554 
6192355001653555 Seems so.
6192355001658554 It's safe here. The Tower is impenetrable for the disease. We'll take care of ourselves—better than you did.
6192355001658555 Better than nothing.
6192355001658556 I understand. I'm leaving.

6192355001658561 It's not like you summoned me. My Line brought me here.
6192355001658562 You could… stay. Father's gone, but perhaps someone could take his place in your heart. Maybe you could become a father yourself. Things would turn around…

6192355001663551 You'll get me nothing! Stay put. I'll find one myself.
6192355001665451 And one more thing...\nIn a moment, a group of soldiers will come here. If they see you, they'll shoot. They're not bad people! It's just... just... how it is.\nDon't attack them, all right? I'll deal with them myself. It's going to be fine, no one has to die... <i>if</i> you just leave this place quietly.
6192355001665452 Good people don't shoot innocents.
6192355001665453 And what exactly will you do? Read them from your good book? No. I have no choice but to protect you.
6192355001665454 Thanks for the warning, I guess.
6192355001665455 Are they coming for you?
6192355001665456 It's all because of me... I've done that to them. But they won't hurt me.\nPlease, if there is a sliver of trust in you, just leave! You can't talk to them, there's no other solution, only fight or flight! And there's no need to spill more blood...
6192355001665457 Yes... I am about to spill different blood.
6192355001665458 We'll see.

6192355001671955 I made this. I can still feel the warmth of my hands on the vial.\n\nA body consists of three Layers: Blood, Bones, and Nerves. Any affliction can be cured if one discovers which Layer has been poisoned.\n\nThis potion allows me to touch the Bones.

6192355001671958 For a "fingernail", can transport a passenger to any other improvised quay, which is sometimes faster than walking.
6192355001671959 Can transport a passenger to any other improvised quay, which is sometimes faster than walking. Costs two "fingernails" now.

6192355001672053 So if I barter at a loss, people would see me as a better person?
6192355001696551 Cures sand pest. Reminds me of older days.
6192355001696552 This "shmowder" is very old, made ten years ago, or even more. Which is impossible, since the First Outbreak only happened five years ago.
6192355001697051 Some things aren't bound to happen.
6192355001697052 Can it help?
6192355001697053 All kinds of things happen...
6192355001697054 I should keep an eye on my immunity in unclean districts. Wearing protective clothes is advised.
6192355001697055 Even though you'd love to.
6192355001697056 The Town Hall is no longer looking for me.
6192355001697057 A bone... so the victims were dogs?
6192355001697058 Who did you think they were?
6192355001697059 ...Nothing. So why did you ask me about revenge?
6192355001697060 This is absurd.
6192355001697061 Dogs? ...Oh, dogs! I see. So Lika poisoned your pets, huh?
6192355001697062 I can wait for two days. If you don't take it by then, I'll do business with someone else. My circumstances are humble.
6192355001697063 Two days... I don't even know what might happen to me in two hours!
6192355001697064 Not a sum easily earned in two days.
6192355001697065 Isidor must have taught you how to hear and pick medicinal herbs. They're in bloom now. And merchants in the Broken Heart would give you a decent price for them.
6192355001697066 Yeah, I know a thing or two about herbs.
6192355001697067 Fine. I'll be back tomorrow, or maybe even today.
6192355001697068 Can I at least take a look at the revolver?
6192355001702151 But...
6192355001702152 I doubt it. That knowledge is taboo. But I can find more morphine in the streets.

6192355001711352 The music has died down.
6192355001715051 And you… so you got out of trouble on your own?
6192355001715052 I have. As you know, I’m good at cutting.
6192355001715053 So you don’t need me all that much, after all.
6192355001715054 I’m glad.
6192355001715055 I’m sorry I couldn’t help…
6192355001715056 Forget me, Cub. Do your thing. Save the Town. Work. How’s the panacea going? Any progress?
6192355001715057 I think so.
6192355001715058 What’s our job for today?
6192355001715059 Is this resignation I hear? I don’t like your tone.
6192355001715060 Tough luck.
6192355001715061 Why do you always have to be so difficult!
6192355001715062 So what’s our job for today?
6192355001734151 Dunno, it just trudges on...
6192355001734152 Nowhere, that's where.

6192355002033453 I feel uneasy…
